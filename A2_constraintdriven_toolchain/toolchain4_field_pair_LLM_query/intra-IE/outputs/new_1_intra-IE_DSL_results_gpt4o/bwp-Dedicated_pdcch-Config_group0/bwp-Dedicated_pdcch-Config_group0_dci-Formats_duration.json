    "evidence": "For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', the UE shall derive: - the CSI parameters without averaging two or more instances of any periodic or semi-persistent n z p -CSI-RSResources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement or for interference measurement located in different DL transmissions, - the instances of the n z p -CSI-RS-Resources are not in the same channel occupancy duration indicated by DCI format 2 0, if the UE is provided at least one of SlotFormatIndicator or co-DurationList; or occupied by PDSCH(s) and/or aperiodic CSI-RS(s) indicated by DCI formats, if any, and the corresponding PDCCH(s), if the UE is neither provided with CO-DurationPerCell nor SlotFormatIndicator, but is provided with csi-RS-ValidationWith-DCI - the interference measurements for computing CSI value based on periodic/semi-persistent CSI-IM measured only in OFDM symbol(s) that fulfill the same conditions under which the UE is expected to receive periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS as described in Clause 11.1 and Clause 11.1.1 of [6, TS 38.213].\n---\nA UE can indicate by countLinkedCandidates a capability for counting PDCCH candidates m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} and m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} either as 2 PDCCH candidates or as 3 PDCCH candidates. For search space sets s_{i}, s_{j}, s_{k} , and s_{l} , that include searchSpaceLinking with values s_{j}, s_{i}, s_{l} , and s_{k} , respectively, a UE expects to simultaneously monitor PDCCH candidates m_{s_{i}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} , and m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)}=m_{s_{l}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} only if a first CCE of m_{s_{i} n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} or m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} has different index than a first CCE of m_{s_{k} n}^{(16)}{ }_{C I, 2} or m_{s_{l} n n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} in a CORESET configured with c c e -REG-MappingType = 'nonInterleaved' and with duration of one symbol. If a UE - is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoringcapability for a downlink cell, - is provided, by searchSpaceLinking, for search space sets s_{i} and s_{j} on the downlink cell respective values s_{j} and s_{i} , and - indicates three-BDforSSsetLinking the UE counts each PDCCH candidate for the one of the search space sets s_{i} and s_{j} that the UE monitors PDCCH in the later span, as two PDCCH candidates. The UE does not expect a first PDCCH candidate from search space set s_{i} or s_{j} and a second PDCCH candidate from a search space set s_{k} that does not include searchSpaceLinking to use a same set of CCEs and same scrambling in a same CORESET, and provide respective first and second DCI formats with same size, in any span other than the first span in a slot. A UE does not expect to be provided freqMonitorLocations for a search space set s in a serving cell if intraCellGuardBandsDL-List indicates that no intra-cell guard-bands are configured for the serving cell.\n---\nETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05) If neither CO-DurationPerCell-r16 nor SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell are provided and if ChannelAccessModerl6 = \"semiStatic\" is provided, the procedures in this clause apply with assuming a channel occupancy time defined in clause 4.3 of [15, TS 37.213] is the remaining channel occupancy duration if a DL transmission burst(s) is detected within the channel occupancy time. A SFI-index field value in a DCI format 20 indicates to a UE a slot format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 \\_0 . The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The SFI-index field includes \\max \\left\\{\\left[\\log _{2}(\\operatorname{maxSFI}\\right.\\right. inde \\left.\\left.x+1)\\right], 1\\right\\} bits where maxSFlindex is the maximum value of the values provided by corresponding slotFormatCombinationId. A slot format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where ' D ' denotes a downlink symbol, 'U' denotes an uplink symbol, and ' F ' denotes a flexible symbol. If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot. A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2 \\_0 on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.\n---\n\\end{table} If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_5 is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats 2-5 indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot. An [AB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2 _ 5 with CRC scrambled by AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets: - a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = common; - a USS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific.\n---\nFor an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT:each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet; for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent. SearchSpaceLinkingld This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. searchSpaceType Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.",
