Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol i is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than N symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of N depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\mu with N=13 for \\mu=0, N=13 for \\mu=1, N=20 for \\mu=2, N=24 for \\mu=3, N=96 for \\mu=5 , and N=192 for \\mu=6 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI, or MSGB-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE used for RACH association as applicable, and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI in response to a random access procedure triggered by a PDCCH order which triggers contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell [10, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of the received PDCCH order and the DM-RS ports of the corresponding PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI are quasi co-located with the same SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving PDSCH in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH retransmission, or when receiving PDSCH in response to a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure, or a PUSCH scheduled by a fallbackRAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH retransmission, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE selected for RACH association and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission for at least one serving cell configured with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on serving cell c_{1} and serving cell c_{2} , the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH on serving cell c_{1} if the PDSCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [10]) on serving cell c_{2} not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission. The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH in a serving cell scheduled by a PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and one or multiple PDSCH(s) required to be received according to this Clause in the same serving cell without a corresponding PDCCH transmission if the PDSCHs partially or fully overlap in time except if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH ends at least 14 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, where \\mu and the symbol duration are based on the smallest numerology between the scheduling PDCCH and the PDSCH, in which case the UE shall decode the PDSCH scheduled by the PDCCH. When the PDCCH reception incudes two PDCCH candidates from two respectvie search space sets, as described in clause 10 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling the PDSCH ends at least 14 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI if another PDSCH in the same cell scheduled with RA-RNTI or MSGB-RNTI partially or fully overlap in time.\n---\nthe duration of periodicityAndPattern in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1. For a bitmap pair included in one or two groups of resource sets, the dynamic indication of availability for PDSCH applies to a set of slot(s) where the rateMatchPatternToAddModList is present among the slots of scheduled PDSCH. If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 with the same starting CCE index in noninterleaved CORESET spanning one OFDM symbol: - and if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH has aggregation level 8 , the resources corresponding to the aggregation level 16 PDCCH candidate are not available for the PDSCH ; - when at least one of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 linked as indicated by higher layer parameter searchSpaceLinking, the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 16 and any other PDCCH candidate(s) linked with any of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 and 16 are not available for the PDSCH reception at the UE, if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH is associated with the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 or 16 . If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH. 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap those of the CORESET in the OFDM symbols occupied by the search space set(s).

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. - An initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH trigger occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\nFor a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i , the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol i , the UE can be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol i . A UE is not expected to be scheduled by a PDCCH ending in symbol i to transmit a PUSCH on a given serving cell overlapping in time with a transmission occasion, where the UE is allowed to transmit a PUSCH with configured grant according to [10, TS38.321], starting in a symbol j on the same serving cell if the end of symbol i is not at least N_{2} symbols before the beginning of symbol j . The value N_{2} in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in Clause 6.4, and N_{2} and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with configured grant and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH. If a UE receives an ACK for a given HARQ process in CG-DFI in a PDCCH ending in symbol i to terminate a transport block repetition in a PUSCH transmission with a configured grant on a given serving cell with the same HARQ process after symbol i , the UE is expected to terminate the repetition of the transport block in a PUSCH transmission starting from a symbol j if the gap between the end of PDCCH of symbol i and the start of the PUSCH transmission in symbol j is equal to or more than N 2 symbols. The value N 2 in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in Clause 6.4, and N 2 and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH indicating CG-DFI.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. - \\quad N_{2} is based on \\mu of Table 6.4-1 and Table 6.4-2 for UE processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where \\mu corresponds to the one of ( \\mu_{D L}, \\mu_{U L} ) resulting with the largest T_{\\text {proc. } 2} , where the \\mu_{D L} corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the downlink with which the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH was transmitted and \\mu_{u l} corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the uplink channel with which the PUSCH is to be transmitted, and \\kappa is defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211]. - For operation with shared spectrum channel access, T_{\\text {ext }} is calculated according to [4, TS 38.211], otherwise T_{\\text {ex }} =0 . - If the first symbol of the PUSCH allocation consists of DM-RS only, then d_{2, /}=0 , otherwise d_{2, /}=1 . - If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation further includes the effect of timing difference between component carriers as given in [11, TS 38.133]. - If the scheduling DCI triggered a switch of \\mathrm{BWP}, d_{2,2} equals to the switching time as defined in [11, TS 38.133], otherwise d_{2,2}=0 . - If a PUSCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH of a smaller priority index, d_{2} for the PUSCH of a larger priority is set as reported by the UE; otherwise d_{2}=0 . - For a UE that supports capability 2 on a given cell, the processing time according to UE processing capability 2 is applied if the high layer parameter processingType2Enabled in PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is configured for the cell and set to 'enable', - If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with one or more PUCCH channels, then the transport block is multiplexed following the procedure in clause 9.2 .5 of [6, TS 38.213], otherwise the transport block is transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by the DCI. - If uplink switching gap is triggered as defined in clause 6.1 .6, T_{\\text {incent }} equals to the switching gap duration and for the UE configured with higher layer parameter uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL' for uplink carrier aggregation \\mu_{U L}=\\min \\left(\\mu_{U L, \\text { carrier } 1}, \\mu_{U L, \\text { carrier } 2}\\right) , otherwise T_{\\text {make }}=0 .
