    "evidence": "The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and DM-RS on the same resource elements. The UE shall assume \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }}>0 for a non-zero-power CSI-RS where \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }} is selected such that the power offset specified by the higher-layer parameter powerControlOffsetSS in the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or in the TRSResourceSet [E, if provided, is fulfilled. The quantities k^{\\prime}, l^{\\prime}, w_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right) , and w_{\\mathrm{t}}\\left(l^{\\prime}\\right) are given by Tables 7.4.1.5.3-1 to 7.4.1.5.3-5 where each (\\bar{k}, \\bar{l}) in a given row of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to a CDM group of size 1 (no CDM) or size 2,4 , or 8. The CDM type is provided by the higher layer parameter cdm-Type in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping IE. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRSResourceSet [E, the CDM type is 'noCDM'. The indices k^{\\prime} and l^{\\prime} index resource elements within a CDM group. The time-domain locations l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} and l_{1} \\in\\{2,3, \\ldots, 12\\} are provided by the higher-layer parameters firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain and firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain2, respectively, in the CSI-RSResourceMapping IE or the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility IE and defined relative to the start of a slot. For NZP CSIRS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the time-domain location l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} is provided by the higher-layer parameter firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain or firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain+4.\n---\n- nrofPorts in resourceMapping defines the number of CSI-RS ports, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - density in resourceMapping defines CSI-RS frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB, and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density value of 1 / 2 , where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4 - 1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid. - cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in.\n---\n- cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'. All CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots.\n---\n\\end{table} For a CSI-RS resource configuration, powerControlOffsetSS is not applicable and a UE expects to be provided only 'noCDM' from cdm-Type, only 'one' and 'three' from density, and only '1 port' from nrofPorts [6, TS 38.214]. If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS for the active DL BWP or, if RadioLinkMonitoringRS is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH receptions in CORESETS on the active DL BWP.",
