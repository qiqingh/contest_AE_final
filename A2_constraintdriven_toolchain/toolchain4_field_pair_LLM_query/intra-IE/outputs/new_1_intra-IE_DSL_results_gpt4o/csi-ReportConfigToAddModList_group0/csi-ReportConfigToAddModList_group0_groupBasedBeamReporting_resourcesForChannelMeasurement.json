    "evidence": "Each CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S >= 1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior. The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement: - CSI-[Mresource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.4. - NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1. - NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1. The UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for channel measurement and the CSI-[M resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'. When NZP CSI-RS resource(s) is used for interference measurement, the UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and the CSI- [M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are QCLed with respect to 'typeD'. For L1-SINR measurement: - When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement on SSB or NZP CSI-RS and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-/M-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter n z p-C S I-R S ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M or on 1 port NZP CSI-RS with density 3 REs/RB, where each SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is associated with one CSI-[M resource or one NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement by the ordering of the SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and CSI-[M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement in the corresponding resource sets. The number of SSB(s) or CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[Mresources or the number of NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement. - UE may apply the SSB, or 'typeD' RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' to the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, as the reference RS for determining 'typeD' assumption for the corresponding CSI[M resource or the corresponding NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting.\n---\n5.2.1.4.1 Resource Setting configuration For aperiodic CSI, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is not configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with one or multiple CSI-ReportConfig where each CSIReportConfig is linked to periodic, or semi-persistent, or aperiodic resource setting(s): - When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. - When three Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement, the second one (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is for CSI-[M based interference measurement and the third one (given by higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for NZP CSI-RS based interference measurement.\n---\nFor aperiodic CSI, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is not configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with one or multiple CSI-ReportConfig where each CSIReportConfig is linked to periodic, or semi-persistent, or aperiodic resource setting(s): - When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. - When three Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement, the second one (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is for CSI-[M based interference measurement and the third one (given by higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for NZP CSI-RS based interference measurement. For aperiodic CSI, and for periodic and semi-persistent CSI resource settings, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with one or multiple CSI-ReportConfig where each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent, setting(s): ETSI\n---\n69 ETSITS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource setting is given by resourcesForChannelMeasurement for L1-RSRP measurement. In such a case, the number of configured CSI Resource Sets in the Resource Setting is \\mathrm{S}=2 For aperiodic CSI, and for aperiodic CSI resource settings, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with resourcesForChannel and resourcesForChannel2, which correspond to first and second resource sets, respectively, for L1-RSRP measurement. For semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s):\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-CQI', - if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, r ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank r and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \\ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \\ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} of port indices, where p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank v and R \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, P\\} where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks. - if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication, the UE assumes, for each CSIRS resource in the CSI resource setting linked to the CSI-ReportConfig, that the CSI-RS port indices p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)}=\\{0, \\ldots, v-1\\} are associated with ranks v=1,2, \\ldots, P where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. - When calculating the CQI for a rank, the UE shall use the ports indicated for that rank for the selected CSI-RS resource. The precoder for the indicated ports shall be assumed to be the identity matrix scaled by \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v}} . If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive filters.",
