For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'.

If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets.

An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 <= K_{s} <= 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs.

When r_{i} is zero, i \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 7\\} , PMI and RI reporting are not allowed to correspond to any precoder associated with v=i+1 layers. For UE configured with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-il-CQI', the bitmap parameter typel-SinglePanel-codebookSubsetRestriction-i2 forms the bit sequence b_{15}, \\ldots, b_{1}, b_{0} where b_{0} is the \\operatorname{LSB} and b_{15} is the MSB. The bit b_{i} is associated with precoders corresponding to codebook index i_{2}=i . When b_{i} is zero, the randomly selected precoder for CQI calculation is not allowed to correspond to any precoder associated with the bit b_{i} . \\begin{table}\n---\nFor Type I, Type II, Enhanced Type II and Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection CSI feedback on PUSCH, a CSI report comprises of two parts. Part 1 has a fixed payload size and is used to identify the number of information bits in Part 2. Part 1 shall be transmitted in its entirety before Part 2. - For Type I CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword (if reported). Part 2 contains PMI (if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4. For a CSI-ReportConfig configured with codebookType set to 'typelSinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, Part 1 contains RI(s), CRI(s), CQI(s) for the first codeword and is zero padded to a fixed payload size (if needed). Part 2 contains the CQI(s) for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4, LIs (if reported) and PMI(s). - For Type II CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients per layer for the Type [I CSI (see Clause 5.2.2.2.3). The fields of Part 1 - RI (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients for each layer are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI and LI (if reported) of the Type [[] CSI. The elements of i_{1,4, l} , i_{2,1, l} (if reported) and i_{2,2, l} (if reported) are reported in the increasing order of their indices, i=0,1, \\ldots, 2 L-1 , where the element of the lowest index is mapped to the most significant bits and the element of the highest index is mapped to the least significant bits. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded. - For Enhanced Type [I CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5) and Further Enhanced Type [I Port Selection CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5), Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers. The fields of Part 1-\\mathrm{RI} (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers - are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI of the Enhanced Type [I or Further Enhanced Type [I Port Selection CSI. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded. A Type [] CSI report that is carried on the PUSCH shall be computed independently from any Type [] CSI report that is carried on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 (see Clause 5.2.4 and 5.2.2). When the higher layer parameter reportQuantity is configured with one of the values 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'criS[NR' or 'ssb-Index-S[NR', or 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'ssb-[ndex-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-S[NRCapability[Set]Index ', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index ',the CSI feedback consists of a single part. For both Type I and Type II reports configured for PUCCH but transmitted on PUSCH, the determination of the payload for CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 follows that of PUCCH as described in Clause 5.2.4.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5-4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5.4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the reportQuantity is set to 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index ', or",
