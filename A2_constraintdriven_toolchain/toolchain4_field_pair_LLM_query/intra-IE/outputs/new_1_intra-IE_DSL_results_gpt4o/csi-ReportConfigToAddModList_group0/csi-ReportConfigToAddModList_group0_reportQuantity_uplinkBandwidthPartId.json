A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig for periodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info. A UE does not expect to be configured with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured both with trs-Info and repetition. Each CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], is configured by the higher layer parameter N Z P -CSI-RS-Resource with the following restrictions: - the time-domain locations of the two CSI-RS resources in a slot, or of the four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots (which are the same across two consecutive slots), as defined by higher layer parameter CSI-RS-resourceMapping, is given by one of - l \\in\\{4,8\\}, l \\in\\{5,9\\} , or l \\in\\{6,10\\} for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 , - l \\in\\{0,4\\}, l \\in\\{1,5\\}, l \\in\\{2,6\\}, l \\in\\{3,7\\}, l \\in\\{7,11\\}, l \\in\\{8,12\\} or l \\in\\{9,13\\} for frequency range 2 . - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211] and higher layer parameter density configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping. - if carrier N_{\\mathrm{grid}}^{\\mathrm{size}, \\mu}=52, N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}}=52, \\mu=0 and the carrier is configured in paired spectrum, the band width of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freq Band configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is X resource blocks, where X >= 28 resources if the UE indicates trs-AddB W-Set I for the trs-AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 1] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation and X >= 32 if the UE indicates t r s -AddBW-Set2 for the AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 2] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation; in these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising \\mathrm{X}<52 resource blocks, the UE does not expect that the total number of PRBs allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4 , where all CSI-RS resource configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freqBand configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is the minimum of 52 and \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}} resource blocks, or is equal to \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} resource blocks.

The time domain behavior of the CSI-ReportConfig is indicated by the higher layer parameter reportConfigType and can be set to 'aperiodic', 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH', 'semiPersistentOnPUSCH', or 'periodic'. For 'periodic' and 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH/'semiPersistentOnPUSCH' CSI reporting, the configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The higher layer parameter reportQuantity indicates the CSI-related, L1-RSRP-related, L1-SINR-related or Capability[Set][ndex-related quantities to report. The reportFreqConfiguration indicates the reporting granularity in the frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI reporting is wideband or sub-band. The timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements parameter in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel measurements and timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements can be configured to enable time domain restriction for interference measurements. The CSI-ReportConfig can also contain CodebookConfig, which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II, Enhanced Type II CSI, or Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection including codebook subset restriction when applicable, and configurations of group-based reporting. ETSI\n---\n- If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'configured', the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing the L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion of CSI-IM or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) or NZP CS[-RS for channel and interference measurement associated with the CSI resource setting. When the UE is configured a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to ' cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' an index of UE capability value, indicating the maximum supported number of SRS antenna ports, is reported along with the pair of SSBRI/CRI and L1-SINR. 5.2.1.5 Triggering/activation of CSI Reports and CSI-RS 5.2.1.5.1 Aperiodic CSI Reporting/Aperiodic CSI-RS when the triggering PDCCH and the CSI-RS have the same numerology For CSI-RS resource sets associated with Resource Settings configured with the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', 'periodic', or 'semi-persistent', trigger states for Reporting Setting(s) (configured with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'aperiodic') and/or Resource Setting for channel and/or interference measurement on one or more component carriers are configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList. For aperiodic CSI report triggering, a single set of CSI triggering states are higher layer configured, wherein the CSI triggering states can be associated with any candidate DL BWP. A UE is not expected to receive more than one DCI with non-zero CSI request field per slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive DCI with non-zero CSI request field within a cell group in a slot overlapping with any slot receiving DCI with non-zero CSI request field in the same cell group. A UE is not expected to be configured with different TCI-Stateld's for the same aperiodic CSI-RS resource ID configured in multiple aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets with the same triggering offset in the same aperiodic trigger state. A UE is not expected to receive more than one aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a given slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveB WP the UE is not expected to be triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP. Otherwise, when a UE is triggered with a CSI report for a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the most recent occasion, no later than the CSI reference resource, of the associated NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected to report the CSI for the non-active DL BWP and the CSI report associated with that BWP is omitted. When a UE is triggered with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS in a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the NZP CSIRS, the UE is not expected to measure the aperiodic CSI-RS. In the carrier of the serving cell expecting to receive that associated NZP CSI-RS, if the active DL BWP when receiving the NZP CSI-RS is different from the active DL BWP when receiving the triggering DCI , - the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the BWP switching shall be no later than the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the CSI trigger, irrespective of whether they are in the same carrier of a serving cell or not and irrespective of whether they are in the same SCS or not; - the UE is not expected to have any other BWP switching in that carrier after the last symbol of the PDCCH span covering the DCI carrying the CSI trigger and before the first symbol of the triggered NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM.\n---\n- powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'.\n---\nIf there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot n^{\\prime} . After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI to report CSI with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to quantities other than 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP- Capability[Set]Index', and 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index ' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report CSI during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in Clause 5-2-1.4 if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitPeriodicL 1 -RSRP to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP- Capability[Set]Index', or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report L1-RSRP during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in clause 5-2.1-4 and when reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP' or 'cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.\n---\nFor a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i , the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol i , the UE can be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol i .\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference NZP CSI RS resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfig/d of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field \"carrier\" above.
