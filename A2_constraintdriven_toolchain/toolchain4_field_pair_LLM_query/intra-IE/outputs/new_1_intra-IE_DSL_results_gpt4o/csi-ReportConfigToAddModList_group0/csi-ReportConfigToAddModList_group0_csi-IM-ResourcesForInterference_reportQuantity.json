When the UE is configured a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to ' cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' an index of UE capability value, indicating the maximum supported number of SRS antenna ports, is reported along with the pair of SSBRI/CRI and L1-SINR. 5.2.1.5 Triggering/activation of CSI Reports and CSI-RS 5.2.1.5.1 Aperiodic CSI Reporting/Aperiodic CSI-RS when the triggering PDCCH and the CSI-RS have the same numerology For CSI-RS resource sets associated with Resource Settings configured with the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', 'periodic', or 'semi-persistent', trigger states for Reporting Setting(s) (configured with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'aperiodic') and/or Resource Setting for channel and/or interference measurement on one or more component carriers are configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList. For aperiodic CSI report triggering, a single set of CSI triggering states are higher layer configured, wherein the CSI triggering states can be associated with any candidate DL BWP. A UE is not expected to receive more than one DCI with non-zero CSI request field per slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive DCI with non-zero CSI request field within a cell group in a slot overlapping with any slot receiving DCI with non-zero CSI request field in the same cell group. A UE is not expected to be configured with different TCI-Stateld's for the same aperiodic CSI-RS resource ID configured in multiple aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets with the same triggering offset in the same aperiodic trigger state. A UE is not expected to receive more than one aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a given slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveB WP the UE is not expected to be triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP. Otherwise, when a UE is triggered with a CSI report for a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the most recent occasion, no later than the CSI reference resource, of the associated NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected to report the CSI for the non-active DL BWP and the CSI report associated with that BWP is omitted. When a UE is triggered with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS in a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the NZP CSIRS, the UE is not expected to measure the aperiodic CSI-RS. In the carrier of the serving cell expecting to receive that associated NZP CSI-RS, if the active DL BWP when receiving the NZP CSI-RS is different from the active DL BWP when receiving the triggering DCI , - the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the BWP switching shall be no later than the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the CSI trigger, irrespective of whether they are in the same carrier of a serving cell or not and irrespective of whether they are in the same SCS or not; - the UE is not expected to have any other BWP switching in that carrier after the last symbol of the PDCCH span covering the DCI carrying the CSI trigger and before the first symbol of the triggered NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM. - when the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the span that involves the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\nIf there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot n^{\\prime} . After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.

A CSI Reporting Setting with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, can be configured with wideband frequency-granularity only if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X=0 , as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2. If the UE is configured with a CSI Reporting Setting for a bandwidth part with fewer than 24 PRBs, the CSI reporting setting is expected to have a wideband frequency-granularity, and, if applicable, the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel'. The first subband size is given by N_{P R B}^{S B}-\\left(N_{B I T P_{j}}^{S^{\\text {stor }}} \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B}\\right) and the last subband size given by \\left(N_{B I T P_{j},}^{\\text {start }}+N_{B I R P_{j},}^{\\text {size }}\\right) \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B} if If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic. A UE configured with DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 does not expect to be triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same CSI-ReportConfigld.\n---\nFor semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s): - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources. An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 <= K_{s} <= 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs. Each Resource Pair consists of one resource from Group 1 and one resource from Group 2. The same resource can be associated with two Resource Pairs in frequency range 1 but not in frequency range 2.\n---\n- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 , the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance nrofReportedRSgroup, if configured, group(s) of two CRIs or SSBRIs selecting one CSI-RS or SSB from each of the two CSI Resource Sets for the report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources of each group can be received simultaneously by the UE. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set][ndex', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE.

If K_{s}=2 \\mathrm{CSI} -RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS ports.

When deriving CSI feedback, the UE is not expected that a NZP CSI -RS resource for channel measurement overlaps with CSI-IM resource for interference measurement or NZP CSI -RS resource for interference measurement. If configured to report CQI index, in the CSI reference resource, the UE shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving the CQI index, and if also configured, for deriving PMI and RI :\n---\n- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M.

If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources. An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 <= K_{s} <= 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs. Each Resource Pair consists of one resource from Group 1 and one resource from Group 2.
