When subband CQI reporting is configured, one CQI for each codeword is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band. - wideband PMI or subband PMI reporting as configured by the higher layer parameter pmi-FormatIndicator. When wideband PMI reporting is configured, a wideband PMI is reported for the entire CSI reporting band. When subband PMI reporting is configured, except with 2 antenna ports, a single wideband indication (i) in Clause 5.2.2.2) is reported for the entire CSI reporting band and one subband indication ( i_{2} in clause 5.2.2.2) is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band.
