Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs.

UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement on SSB or NZP CSI-RS and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-/M-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter n z p-C S I-R S ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M or on 1 port NZP CSI-RS with density 3 REs/RB, where each SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is associated with one CSI-[M resource or one NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement by the ordering of the SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and CSI-[M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement in the corresponding resource sets. The number of SSB(s) or CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[Mresources or the number of NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement. - UE may apply the SSB, or 'typeD' RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' to the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, as the reference RS for determining 'typeD' assumption for the corresponding CSI[M resource or the corresponding NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting.\n---\nThe first subband size is given by N_{P R B}^{S B}-\\left(N_{B I T P_{j}}^{S^{\\text {stor }}} \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B}\\right) and the last subband size given by \\left(N_{B I T P_{j},}^{\\text {start }}+N_{B I R P_{j},}^{\\text {size }}\\right) \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B} if If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent.

In such a case, the number of configured CSI Resource Sets in the Resource Setting is \\mathrm{S}=2 For aperiodic CSI, and for aperiodic CSI resource settings, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with resourcesForChannel and resourcesForChannel2, which correspond to first and second resource sets, respectively, for L1-RSRP measurement. For semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s): - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'.

If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources. An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 <= K_{s} <= 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs. Each Resource Pair consists of one resource from Group 1 and one resource from Group 2. The same resource can be associated with two Resource Pairs in frequency range 1 but not in frequency range 2. Except for L1-SINR, if interference measurement is performed on NZP CSI-RS, a UE does not expect to be configured with more than one NZP CSI-RS resource in the associated resource set within the resource setting for channel measurement. Except for L1-SINR, the UE configured with the higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RSResourcesForInterference may expect no more than 18 NZP CSI-RS ports configured in a NZP CSI-RS resource set. For CSI measurement(s) other than L1-SINR, a UE assumes: - each NZP CSI-RS port configured for interference measurement corresponds to an interference transmission layer. - all interference transmission layers on NZP CSI-RS ports for interference measurement take into account the associated EPRE ratios configured in 5.2.2.3.1; - other interference signal on REs of NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement, or CSI-IM resource for interference measurement. For L1-SINR measurement with dedicated interference measurement resources, a UE assumes:\n---\n- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI ', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-SINR', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index', and K_{s}>1 resources are configured in the corresponding resource set for channel measurement, then the UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI conditioned on the reported CRI, where CRI k(k >= 0) corresponds to the configured ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet for channel measurement, and ( k+1 )-th entry of associated csi-IM-Resource in the corresponding csi-IMResourceSet (if configured) or ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet (if configured for CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR' or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set][ndex') for interference measurement. If K_{s}=2 \\mathrm{CSI} -RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS ports. If 2<K_{s} <= 8 CSI-RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 8 CSI-RS ports.

M_{1} and M_{2} are the numbers of resources associated to a CRI value, other than the N CRIs defined above, in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, with M=M_{1}+M_{2} , such that the total number of CRI values configured for the CSI-ReportConfig is M+N . - If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X \\in\\{0\\}, M_{1}=M_{2}=0 ; otherwise, - if the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode1' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X \\in\\{1,2\\} , or if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode2', - if shared C M R is configured: M_{1}=K_{1} and M_{2}=K_{2} ; otherwise - if sharedCMR is not configured, only the resources in Group 1 and Group 2 that are not referred to in any Resource Pair are associated to M CRI values other than the N CRIs defined above. - If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, M+N resources are configured in the corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet.
