A CSI Reporting Setting with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, can be configured with wideband frequency-granularity only if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X=0 , as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2. If the UE is configured with a CSI Reporting Setting for a bandwidth part with fewer than 24 PRBs, the CSI reporting setting is expected to have a wideband frequency-granularity, and, if applicable, the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel'. The first subband size is given by N_{P R B}^{S B}-\\left(N_{B I T P_{j}}^{S^{\\text {stor }}} \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B}\\right) and the last subband size given by \\left(N_{B I T P_{j},}^{\\text {start }}+N_{B I R P_{j},}^{\\text {size }}\\right) \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B} if If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic. A UE configured with DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 does not expect to be triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same CSI-ReportConfigld.",
