When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is not configured ( R=N_{s} ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped in all the N_{s} symbols to the same set of subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition ( R=1 ), according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{\\text {SRS }}, C_{\\text {SRS }} and b_{\\text {hop }} defined in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within an SRS resource in each slot are configured ( N_{s} >= 4, R >= 2 ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and frequency hopping across the \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs is according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{S R S}, C_{S R S} and b_{\\text {hop }} , where N_{S} should be divisible by R . For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that multiple hops of an SRS resource transmission are in different RB sets. A UE may be configured N_{s}=2,4,8,10,12 or 14 adjacent symbol aperiodic SRS resource with intra-slot frequency hopping within a bandwidth part, where the full hopping bandwidth is sounded with an equal-size subband across N_{s} symbols when frequency hopping is configured with R=1 . A UE may be configured N_{s} >= 4 adjacent symbols aperiodic SRS resource with intra-slot frequency hopping within a bandwidth part, where the full hopping bandwidth is sounded with an equal-size subband across \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs of R adjacent OFDM symbols, when frequency hopping is configured with R >= 2, N_{s} >= R and N_{s} should be divisible by R . Each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols of the resource. A UE may be configured N_{s}=1 symbol periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource with inter-slot hopping within a bandwidth part, where the SRS resource occupies the same symbol location in each slot. A UE may be configured N_{s}= 2,4,8,10,12 or 14 symbol periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource with intra-slot and inter-slot hopping within a bandwidth part, where the N -symbol SRS resource occupies the same symbol location(s) in each slot. For N_{s} >= 4 , when frequency hopping is configured with R >= 2 , intra-slot and inter-slot hopping is supported with each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource mapped to different sets of subcarriers across \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs of R adjacent OFDM symbol(s) of the resource in each slot, where N_{s} should be divisible by R . Each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols of the resource in each slot. For N_{s}=R , when frequency hopping is configured, inter-slot frequency hopping is supported with each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource mapped to the same set of subcarriers in R adjacent OFDM symbol(s) of the resource in each slot. 6.2.1.2 UE sounding procedure for DL CSI acquisition When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set as 'antennaSwitching', the UE may be configured with only one of the following configurations depending on the indicated UE capability supportedSRS-TxPortSwitch ('t1r2' for 1T2R, 't1r1-t1r2' for 1T=1R/1T2R, 't2r4' for 2T4R, 't1r4' for 1T4R, 't1r6' for 1T6R, '1t8r' for 1T8R, '2t6r' for 2T6R, '2t8r' for 2T8R, '4t8r' for 4T8R, 't1r1-t1r2-t1r4' for 1T=1R/1T2R/1T4R, 't1r4t 2 r 4 ' for 1T4R/2T4R, 't1r1-t1r2-t2r2-t2r4' for 1T=1R/1T2R/2T=2R/2T4R, 't1r1-t1r2-t2r2-t1r4-t2r4' for 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 1 \\mathrm{~T} 2 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} / 1 \\mathrm{~T} 4 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T} 4 \\mathrm{R} , ' t 1 r 1 ' for 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} , ' t 2 r 2 ' for 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} , ' \\mathrm{t} 1 \\mathrm{r} 1-\\mathrm{t} 2 \\mathrm{r} 2 ' for 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} , ' t 4 r 4 ' for 4 \\mathrm{~T}=4 \\mathrm{R} , or ' \\mathrm{t} 1 \\mathrm{r} 1-\\mathrm{t} 2 \\mathrm{r} 2-\\mathrm{t} 4 \\mathrm{r} 4 ' for 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} / 4 \\mathrm{~T}=4 \\mathrm{R} ): - For 1T2R, if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets] and/or a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration]: - zero or one or two SRS resource sets configured with different value of resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' or 'semi-persistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in\n---\n- for reception of CSI-RS for tracking with higher layer parameter pdc-Info, the UE follows the procedures for reception of CSI-RS for tracking defined in Clause 5.1.6.1.1. - for reception of the one PRS configuration provided by RRC [12, TS 38.331] for RTT-based propagation delay compensation, the UE follows the procedure for PRS reception for RTT-based propagation delay compensation defined in Clause 9.1. - for transmission of an SRS resource set configured with usage-pdc, the UE follows the procedures for SRS transmission defined in Clause 6.2.1. 9.1 PRS reception procedure for RTT-based propagation delay compensation The DL PRS resource set for RTT-based propagation delay compensation consists of \\mathrm{K} >= 1 DL PRS resource(s) where each has an associated spatial transmission filter. Each DL PRS resource is configured via higher layer parameters N R -DL-PRS-Resource and is uniquely defined by n r-D L- PRS-ResourcelD. The subcarrier spacing and the cyclic prefix of the DL PRS resources are defined by the subcarrier spacing and the cyclic prefix of the DL active bandwidth part of the serving cell. The DL PRS resource set for RTT-based propagation delay compensation is configured by NR-DL-PRS-PDCResourceSet, consists of one or more DL PRS resource(s) and it is defined by: - dl-PRS-Periodicity-and-ResourceSetSlotOffset defines the DL PRS resource periodicity and takes values T_{\\mathrm{per}}^{\\mathrm{PRS}} \\in 2^{\\mu}\\{4,5,8,10,16,20,32,40,64,80,160,320,640,1280,2560,5120,10240\\} slots, where \\mu=0,1,2,3 for 15 , 30,60 and 120 kHz subcarrier spacing respectively and the slot offset for DL PRS resource set with respect to SFN0 slot 0 . All the DL PRS resources are configured with the same DL PRS resource periodicity. - dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor defines how many times each DL-PRS resource is repeated for a single instance of the DL-PRS resource set and takes values T_{\\text {rep }}^{\\text {PRS }} \\in\\{1,2,4,6,8,16,32\\} . All the DL PRS resources within the resource set have the same resource repetition factor. - dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap defines the offset in number of slots between two repeated instances of a DL PRS resource with the same n r-D L-P R S -ResourcelD within a single instance of the DL PRS resource set. The UE only expects to be configured with dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap if dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor is configured with value greater than 1. The time duration spanned by one instance of a n r-D L-P R S -ResourceSet is not expected to exceed the configured value of DL PRS periodicity. All the DL PRS resources within the resource set have the same value of dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap. - dl-PRS-ResourceList determines the DL PRS resources that are contained within the DL PRS resource set.",
