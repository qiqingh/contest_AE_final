If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbois and repetitionFactor to ' n 1 '. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} resourceType Periodicity and offset for semi-persistent and periodic SRS resource (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
