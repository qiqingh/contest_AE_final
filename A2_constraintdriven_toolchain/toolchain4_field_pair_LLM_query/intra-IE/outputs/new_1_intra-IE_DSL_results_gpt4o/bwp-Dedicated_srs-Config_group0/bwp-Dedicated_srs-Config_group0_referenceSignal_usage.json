The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell. The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. ETSI\n---\nThe UE shall maintain power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to frequency hopping, or in response to the use of a different SRS resource set association for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B , or in response to the use of different spatial relations or different power control parameters for the two PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, or in response to any event not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE. The UE maintains power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to an event triggered by DCI other than frequency hopping or by MAC-CE, subject to UE capability. 6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure 6.2.1 UE sounding procedure The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously. When the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter t r s -Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\n6.2.1 UE sounding procedure The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously. When the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter t r s -Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\n- N_{\\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} and \\mu_{\\text {off set, PDCCH }} are the N_{\\text {slot, offset }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} and the \\mu_{\\text {offset }} , respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, N_{\\text {slot, offset, SRS }}^{C A} and \\mu_{\\text {offset, SRS }} are the N_{\\text {slot,offsel }}^{C A} and the \\mu_{\\text {offset }} , respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing' or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, or of the latest reference aperiodic CSI-RS. If the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS or of the reference aperiodic SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS. - when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot n , the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is also not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior between SRS resource and associated SRS resources set.\n---\n- the second value, associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.228/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines the second value of \\alpha_{b_{1}, c}(j) from the p 0 -PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the second SRI field value - if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes one SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for the SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values and determines the values of \\alpha_{b, f, c}(j) from the p 0 -PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the SRI field value - If the UE is not provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and if the PUSCH transmission except for the PUSCH retransmission corresponding to a RAR UL grant is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, or if SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl is not provided to the UE, j=2 , and the UE determines \\alpha_{b_{1}, c}(j) from the value of the first P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets - If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field and includes an SRS resource set indicator field with value 10 or 11 , the UE determines \\alpha_{b, f, c}(j) from first and second P 0 -PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets - M_{\\mathrm{RB}, b_{1}, c_{c}}^{\\mathrm{PUSC}}(i) is the bandwidth of the PUSCH resource assignment expressed in number of resource blocks for PUSCH transmission occasion i on active UL BWP b of carrier f of serving cell c and \\mu is a SCS configuration defined in [4, TS 38.211] - P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB calculated by the UE using reference signal (RS) index q_{d} for the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12 , of carrier f of serving cell c - If the UE is not provided PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS and enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS, or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB - If the UE is configured with a number of RS resource indexes, up to the value of maxNrofPUSCHPathlossReferenceRSs, and a respective set of RS configurations for the number of RS resource indexes by PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS, the set of RS resource indexes can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index.
