If this PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_2 , or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE determines its PUSCH transmission precoder(s) based on SRI(s), TPMI(s) and the transmission rank, where the SRI(s), TPMI(s) and the transmission rank are given by DCI fields of one or two SRS resource indicators and one or two Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0 \\_1 and 0 \\_2 or given by srsResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator, srs-ResourceIndicator2, precodingAndNumberOfLayers, and precodingAndNumberOfLayers2 according to clause 6.1.2.3. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) applicable for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 in SRS-config, respectively. Only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', and only one or two SRS resource sets can be ETSI\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook'. When only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3. The TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3-1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The indicated SRI in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', one or two SRI(s), and one or two TPMI(s) are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicator and two Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) and TPMI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6-1.2.1. Each TPMI, based on indicated codepoint of SRS Resource Set indicator, is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the corresponding SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured for the applicable SRS resource set, or if a single SRS resource is configured for the applicable SRS resource set TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource. For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.\n---\nThe DM-RS antenna ports \\left\\{\\widetilde{p}_{0, \\ldots,} \\widetilde{p}_{v-1}\\right\\} in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of [4, TS38.211] are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212]. Except when higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2', when multiple SRS resources are configured by SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook', the UE shall expect that higher layer parameters nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Resource in SRS-ResourceSet shall be configured with the same value for all these SRS resources. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2', - the UE can be configured with one SRS resource or multiple SRS resources with same or different number of SRS ports within an SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook'. - up to 2 different spatial relations can be configured for all SRS resources in the SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook' when multiple SRS resources are configured in the SRS resource set. - subject to UE capability, a maximum of 2 or 4 SRS resources are supported in an SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook'. 6.1.1.2 Non-Codebook based UL transmission For non-codebook based transmission, PUSCH can be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_1, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_2 or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3. If this PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0_1, DCI format 0 \\_2 , or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE can determine its PUSCH precoder(s) and transmission rank based on the SRI(s) when multiple SRS resources are configured, where the SRI(s) is given by one or two SRS resource indicator(s) in DCI according to clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5,38.212] for DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 , or the SRI is given by srs-ResourceIndicator according to clause 6.1.2.3, or two SRIs given by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator 2 according to clause 6.1.2.3. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) applicable for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 in SRS-config, respectively. The UE shall use one or multiple SRS resources for SRS transmission, where, in a SRS resource set, the maximum number of SRS resources which can be configured to the UE for simultaneous transmission in the same symbol and the maximum number of SRS resources are UE capabilities. The SRS resources transmitted simultaneously occupy the same RBs. Only one SRS port for each SRS resource is configured. Only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', and only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook'. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', one or two SRIs are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicators in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6.1.2.1. The maximum number of SRS resources per SRS resource set that can be configured for non-codebook based uplink transmission is 4 . Each of the indicated one or two SRIs in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS transmission is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) For non-codebook based UL transmission, the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit is determined based on SRI(s) in DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 or higher layer parameter sri-Resourcelndicator in rrcConfiguredUplinkGrant. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'noncodebook', the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit corresponding to each SRS resource set is determined based on SRI(s) corresponding to the associated SRS resource set or higher layer parameter sri-ResourceIndicator or sriResourceIndicator 2 corresponding to the associated SRS resource set in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. A UE is configured with the PT-RS port index for each configured SRS resource by the higher layer parameter ptrs-PortIndex configured by SRS-Config if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in DMRSUplinkConfig. If the PT-RS port index associated with different SRIs are the same, the corresponding UL DM-RS ports are associated to the one UL PT-RS port. For partial-coherent and non-coherent codebook-based UL transmission, the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) is determined based on TPMI(s) and/or number of layers which are indicated by 'Precoding information and number of layers' field(s) in DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 or configured by higher layer parameter precodingAndNumberOfLayers:\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} srs-ResourceldList, srs-PosResourceldList The IDs of the SRS-Resources/SRS-PosResource used in this SRS-ResourceSet/SRS-PosResourceSet. If this SRS-ResourceSet is configured with usage set to codebook, the srs-ResourceldList contains at most 2 entries. If this SRS-ResourceSet is configured with usage set to nonCodebook, the srs-ResourceldList contains at most 4 entries. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} srs-ResourceSetid, srs-PosResourceSetid The ID of this resource set.
