    "evidence": "- Time domain behaviour of SRS resource configuration as indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType, which may be periodic, semi-persistent, aperiodic SRS transmission as defined in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher layer parameters periodicityAndOffset- p or periodicityAndOffset-sp for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource set SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet with different slot level periodicities. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a list of zero up to four different available slot offset values from the reference slot n+k to the slot where the aperiodic SRS resource set is transmitted where n is the slot with triggering DCI and k is SlotOffset is defined by the higher layer parameter AvailableSlotOffset. The parameter AvailableSlotOffset can be configured up to 4 different values. For an SRSPosResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', the slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset for each SRS resource. - Number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource, starting OFDM symbol of the SRS resource within a slot including repetition factor R as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceMapping and described in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If R is not configured, then R is equal to the number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource. - SRS bandwidth B_{S R S} and C_{S R S} , as defined by the higher layer parameter freqHopping and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then B_{\\text {SRS }}=0 . - Frequency hopping bandwidth b_{\\text {hop }} , as defined by the higher layer parameter freqHopping and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then b_{\\text {hop }}=0 . - Defining partial frequency sounding factor and start RB index for partial frequency sounding as defined by the higher layer parameters FreqScalingFactor \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{F}} and StartRBIndex k_{\\mathrm{F}} , respectively, and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then P_{F}=1 and k_{F}=0 . - Defining start RB index hopping for partial frequency sounding in different SRS frequency hopping periods for aperiodic/periodic/semi-persistent SRS based on the hopping pattern k_{\\text {hopping }} as described in clause 6.4.1.4.3 in [4, TS 38.211. If not configured, then start RB hopping is not enabled and k_{\\text {hoppng }} is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. - Defining frequency domain position and configurable shift, as defined by the higher layer parameters freqDomainPosition and freqDomainShift, respectively, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If freqDomainPosition is not configured, freqDomainPosition is zero. - Cyclic shift, as defined by the higher layer parameter cyclicShift-n2, cyclicShift-n4, or cyclicShift-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4 or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb value, as defined by the higher layer parameter transmission Comb described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb offset, as defined by the higher layer parameter combOffset-n2, combOffset-n4, and combOffset-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4, or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211].\n---\n6.2.1.1 UE SRS frequency hopping procedure For a given S R S resource, the U E is configured with repetition factor R \\in\\{1,2,4\\} or R \\in\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14\\} by higher layer parameter resourceMapping in SRS-Resource where R <= N_{s} . When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is not configured ( R=N_{s} ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped in all the N_{s} symbols to the same set of subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition ( R=1 ), according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{\\text {SRS }}, C_{\\text {SRS }} and b_{\\text {hop }} defined in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within an SRS resource in each slot are configured ( N_{s} >= 4, R >= 2 ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and frequency hopping across the \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs is according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{S R S}, C_{S R S} and b_{\\text {hop }} , where N_{S} should be divisible by R . For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that multiple hops of an SRS resource transmission are in different RB sets.",
