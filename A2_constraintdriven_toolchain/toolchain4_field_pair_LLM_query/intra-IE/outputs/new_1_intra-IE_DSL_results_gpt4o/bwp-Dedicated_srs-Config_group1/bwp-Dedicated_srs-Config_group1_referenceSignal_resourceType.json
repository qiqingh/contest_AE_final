For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'periodic': - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing', or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-spatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS.

The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set.

When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, each [D in the list of reference signal [Ds may refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell indicated by PCI field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a d l- PRS-ID indicated by DL-PRS ID field in the activation command. - if an SRS resource in the activated resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, the UE shall assume that the ID of the reference signal in the activation command overrides the one configured in spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos.\n---\n- N_{\\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} and \\mu_{\\text {off set, PDCCH }} are the N_{\\text {slot, offset }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} and the \\mu_{\\text {offset }} , respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, N_{\\text {slot, offset, SRS }}^{C A} and \\mu_{\\text {offset, SRS }} are the N_{\\text {slot,offsel }}^{C A} and the \\mu_{\\text {offset }} , respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing' or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, or of the latest reference aperiodic CSI-RS. If the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS or of the reference aperiodic SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS. - when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot n , the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is also not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior between SRS resource and associated SRS resources set. For operation in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be configured on overlapping symbols with a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource with resourceType of both SRS resources as 'periodic'. For operation in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be activated or triggered to transmit SRS on overlapping symbols with a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource with resourceType of both SRS resources as 'semi-persistent' or 'aperiodic'.",
