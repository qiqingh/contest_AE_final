    "evidence": "The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and DM-RS on the same resource elements. The UE shall assume \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }}>0 for a non-zero-power CSI-RS where \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }} is selected such that the power offset specified by the higher-layer parameter powerControlOffsetSS in the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or in the TRSResourceSet [E, if provided, is fulfilled. The quantities k^{\\prime}, l^{\\prime}, w_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right) , and w_{\\mathrm{t}}\\left(l^{\\prime}\\right) are given by Tables 7.4.1.5.3-1 to 7.4.1.5.3-5 where each (\\bar{k}, \\bar{l}) in a given row of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to a CDM group of size 1 (no CDM) or size 2,4 , or 8. The CDM type is provided by the higher layer parameter cdm-Type in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping IE. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRSResourceSet [E, the CDM type is 'noCDM'. The indices k^{\\prime} and l^{\\prime} index resource elements within a CDM group. The time-domain locations l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} and l_{1} \\in\\{2,3, \\ldots, 12\\} are provided by the higher-layer parameters firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain and firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain2, respectively, in the CSI-RSResourceMapping IE or the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility IE and defined relative to the start of a slot. For NZP CSIRS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the time-domain location l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} is provided by the higher-layer parameter firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain or firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain+4. The frequency-domain location is given by a bitmap provided by the higher-layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E, the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility [E, or the TRSResourceSet [E, with the bitmap and value of k_{i} in Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 given by - \\left[b_{3} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) for row 1 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 - \\left[b_{1}, \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) for row 2 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1\n---\n- where the first symbol location in a slot is indicated by firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain in the TRSResourceSet and the second symbol location in a slot is firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain +4 - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211]. - the band width and the frequency location of the NZP CSI-RS resource, is given by the higher layer parameter nrofRBs, startingRB and frequencyDomainAllocation in a TRS-ResourceSet and applies to all resources in a TRSResourceSet. Band width, nrofRBs, and the initial CRB index, startingRB, of the NZP CSI-RS resource configured by TRS-ResourceSet are not restricted by initial DL BWP. - UE is not required to receive TRS occasions outside the initial DL BWP. - the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet. - the UE does not expect the TRS-ResourceSet to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of NZP CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the UE may assume the sub-carrier spacing of the NZP CSI-RS resources configured by TRS-ResourceSet to be same as the sub-carrier spacing of the initial DL BWP. - powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - the QCL information for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter s s b -Index configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is a SS/PBCH block, applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - One or more scramblingIDs where if a single scramblingID is configured, it applies to all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the resource set, otherwise, each NZP-CSI-RS resource is provided with a scramblingID.",
