The starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted are given by the higher-layer parameters freqBand and density in the CSI-RSResourceMapping [E for the bandwidth part given by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig IE or given by the higher-layer parameters nrofPRBs in the CSI-RS-CellMobility [E where the the startPRB given by csi r s -Measurement B W is relative to common resource block 0 . For NZP CSI-RS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the CSI-RS can be transmitted are given by the higherlayer parameters nrofRBs, and startingRB in the TRS-ResourceSet [E, where startingRB is relative to common resource block 0 and the density \\rho=3 . The UE shall assume that a CSI-RS is transmitted using antenna ports p numbered according to\n---\n- where the first symbol location in a slot is indicated by firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain in the TRSResourceSet and the second symbol location in a slot is firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain +4 - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211]. - the band width and the frequency location of the NZP CSI-RS resource, is given by the higher layer parameter nrofRBs, startingRB and frequencyDomainAllocation in a TRS-ResourceSet and applies to all resources in a TRSResourceSet. Band width, nrofRBs, and the initial CRB index, startingRB, of the NZP CSI-RS resource configured by TRS-ResourceSet are not restricted by initial DL BWP. - UE is not required to receive TRS occasions outside the initial DL BWP. - the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet.\n---\nAll CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots. The band width and initial common resource block (CRB) index of a CSI-RS resource within a BWP, as defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], are determined based on the higher layer parameters nrofRBs and startingRB, respectively, within the CSI-FrequencyOccupation IE configured by the higher layer parameter freqBand within the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E. Both nrofRBs and startingRB are configured as integer multiples of 4 RBs , and the reference point for starting R B is CRB 0 on the common resource block grid. If starting R B<N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , the UE shall assume that the initial CRB index of the CSI-RS resource is N_{\\text {initial } R B}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , otherwise N_{\\text {initial } R B}= startingRB. If nrofRBs >N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial RB }} , the UE shall assume that the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource is N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial } R B} , otherwise N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=n r o f R B s . In all cases, the UE shall expect that N_{\\text {CSI-RS }}^{B W} >= \\min \\left(24, N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}\\right) . ETSI",
