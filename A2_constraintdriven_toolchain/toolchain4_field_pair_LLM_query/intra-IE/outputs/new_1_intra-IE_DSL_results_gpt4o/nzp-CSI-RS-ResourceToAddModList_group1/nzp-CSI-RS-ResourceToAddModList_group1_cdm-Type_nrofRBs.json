    "evidence": "The UE shall assume \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }}>0 for a non-zero-power CSI-RS where \\beta_{\\text {CSIRS }} is selected such that the power offset specified by the higher-layer parameter powerControlOffsetSS in the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or in the TRSResourceSet [E, if provided, is fulfilled. The quantities k^{\\prime}, l^{\\prime}, w_{\\mathrm{f}}\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right) , and w_{\\mathrm{t}}\\left(l^{\\prime}\\right) are given by Tables 7.4.1.5.3-1 to 7.4.1.5.3-5 where each (\\bar{k}, \\bar{l}) in a given row of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to a CDM group of size 1 (no CDM) or size 2,4 , or 8. The CDM type is provided by the higher layer parameter cdm-Type in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping IE. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRSResourceSet [E, the CDM type is 'noCDM'. The indices k^{\\prime} and l^{\\prime} index resource elements within a CDM group. The time-domain locations l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} and l_{1} \\in\\{2,3, \\ldots, 12\\} are provided by the higher-layer parameters firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain and firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain2, respectively, in the CSI-RSResourceMapping IE or the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility IE and defined relative to the start of a slot. For NZP CSIRS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the time-domain location l_{0} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 13\\} is provided by the higher-layer parameter firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain or firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain+4. The frequency-domain location is given by a bitmap provided by the higher-layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E, the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility [E, or the TRSResourceSet [E, with the bitmap and value of k_{i} in Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 given by - \\left[b_{3} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) for row 1 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 - \\left[b_{1}, \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) for row 2 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 - \\left[b_{2} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=4 f(i) for row 4 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 - \\left[b_{5} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=2 f(i) for all other cases where f(i) is the bit number of the i^{\\text {th }} bit in the bitmap set to one, repeated across every [1 / \\rho] of the resource blocks configured for CSI-RS reception by the UE. The starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted are given by the higher-layer parameters freqBand and density in the CSI-RSResourceMapping [E for the bandwidth part given by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig IE or given by the higher-layer parameters nrofPRBs in the CSI-RS-CellMobility [E where the the startPRB given by csi r s -Measurement B W is relative to common resource block 0 . For NZP CSI-RS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the CSI-RS can be transmitted are given by the higherlayer parameters nrofRBs, and startingRB in the TRS-ResourceSet [E, where startingRB is relative to common resource block 0 and the density \\rho=3 . The UE shall assume that a CSI-RS is transmitted using antenna ports p numbered according to\n---\nAll CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots. The band width and initial common resource block (CRB) index of a CSI-RS resource within a BWP, as defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], are determined based on the higher layer parameters nrofRBs and startingRB, respectively, within the CSI-FrequencyOccupation IE configured by the higher layer parameter freqBand within the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E. Both nrofRBs and startingRB are configured as integer multiples of 4 RBs , and the reference point for starting R B is CRB 0 on the common resource block grid. If starting R B<N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , the UE shall assume that the initial CRB index of the CSI-RS resource is N_{\\text {initial } R B}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , otherwise N_{\\text {initial } R B}= startingRB. If nrofRBs >N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial RB }} , the UE shall assume that the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource is N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial } R B} , otherwise N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=n r o f R B s . In all cases, the UE shall expect that N_{\\text {CSI-RS }}^{B W} >= \\min \\left(24, N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}\\right) . ETSI",
