All the DL PRS resources within the resource set have the same resource repetition factor. - dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap defines the offset in number of slots between two repeated instances of a DL PRS resource with the same n r-D L-P R S -ResourcelD within a single instance of the DL PRS resource set.

It is applied to all resources of the DL-PRS Resource Set. Enumerated values n2, n4, n6, n8, n16, n32 correspond to 2,4,6, 8, 16, 32 resource repetitions, respectively. If this field is absent, the value for dl-PRSResourceRepetitionFactor is 1 (i.e., no resource repetition). \\end{tabular}\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} periodicityAndOffset-sp Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in \"number of slots\". Value sil corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value s/ 2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sli the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} ptrs-Portindex The PTRS port index for this SRS resource for non-codebook based UL MIMO. This is only applicable when the corresponding PTRS-UplinkConfig is set to CP-OFDM. The ptrs-Portindex configured here must be smaller than the maxNrofPorts configured in the PTRS-UplinkConfig (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.3.1).

The configured SRS resource does not exceed the slot boundary. If resourceMapping-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix). If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbois and repetitionFactor to ' n 1 '. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l}",
