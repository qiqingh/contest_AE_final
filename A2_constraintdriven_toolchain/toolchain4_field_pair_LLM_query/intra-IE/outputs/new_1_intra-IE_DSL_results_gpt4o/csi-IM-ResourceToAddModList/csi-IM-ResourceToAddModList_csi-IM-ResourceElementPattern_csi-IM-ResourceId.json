It has a variable size and consists of the following fields:\n---\nEach CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S >= 1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior. The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement:\n---\nThe first subband size is given by N_{P R B}^{S B}-\\left(N_{B I T P_{j}}^{S^{\\text {stor }}} \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B}\\right) and the last subband size given by \\left(N_{B I T P_{j},}^{\\text {start }}+N_{B I R P_{j},}^{\\text {size }}\\right) \\bmod N_{P R B}^{S B} if If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic. A UE configured with DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 does not expect to be triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same CSI-ReportConfigld.\n---\nFor semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s): - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI ', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-SINR', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index', and K_{s}>1 resources are configured in the corresponding resource set for channel measurement, then the UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI conditioned on the reported CRI, where CRI k(k >= 0) corresponds to the configured ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet for channel measurement, and ( k+1 )-th entry of associated csi-IM-Resource in the corresponding csi-IMResourceSet (if configured) or ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet (if configured for CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR' or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set][ndex') for interference measurement. If K_{s}=2 \\mathrm{CSI} -RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS ports. If 2<K_{s} <= 8 CSI-RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 8 CSI-RS ports. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMICQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI' and the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement is configured with K_{s} >= 2 resources, two Resource Groups with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1, K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, K_{1}+ K_{2}=K_{s} , and N Resource Pairs:\n---\n\\end{table} If the UE has an active semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource configuration, or an active semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration, and has not received a deactivation command, the activated semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set or the activated semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configurations are considered to be active when the corresponding DL BWP is active, otherwise they are considered suspended. If the UE is configured with carrier deactivation, the following configurations in the carrier in activated state would also be deactivated and need re-activation configuration(s): semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI- [M resource, semi-persistent CSI reporting on PUCCH, semi-persistent SRS, semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set.\n---\nIf the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to \"Configured\", the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing CSI reported in uplink slot n based on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion of NZP CSI-RS (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) associated with the CSI resource setting. If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements is set to \"notConfigured\", the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing CSI value reported in uplink slot n based on only the CSI-IM and/or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement no later than the CSI reference resource associated with the CSI resource setting. If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to \"Configured\", the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing the CSI value reported in uplink slot n based on the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion of CSI-IM and/or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) associated with the CSI resource setting.\n---\n121 ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) 5.2.2.4 Channel State Information - Interference Measurement (CSI-IM) The UE can be configured with one or more CSI-[M resource set configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameter CSI-IM-ResourceSet. Each CSI-[M resource set consists of K >= 1 CSI-[M resource(s).\n---\nIf there is one or more aperiodic CSI reports multiplexed on a PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs and if symbol S_{0} is before symbol Z_{\\text {ref }}^{\\text {m }} that is a next uplink symbol with CP starting after Z_{\\text {proc, } \\mathrm{CSI}}^{\\text {mux }}= \\left(Z^{\\prime}+d\\right) \\cdot(2048+144) \\cdot \\kappa \\cdot 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{C} after the end of the last symbol of - the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, and - the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and - the last symbol of aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference measurements, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for triggered CSI report n the UE is not required to update the CSI report for the triggered CSI report n .
