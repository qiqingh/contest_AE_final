When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be scheduled with a DCI in slot n to receive a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI with K_{0} smaller than \\left\\lceil K_{0 \\min } \\cdot \\frac{2 \\mu^{\\prime}}{2^{\\mu}}\\right\\rceil , where K_{0 \\mathrm{~mm}} and \\mu are the applied minimum scheduling offset restriction and the numerology of the active DL BWP of the scheduled cell when receiving the DCI in slot n , respectively, and \\mu^{\\prime} is the numerology of the new active DL BWP in case of active DL BWP change in the scheduled cell and is equal to \\mu , otherwise. The minimum scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PDSCH transmission is scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in common search space associated with CORESET0 and default PDSCH time domain resource allocation is used, in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld when monitoring PDCCH as described in [6, TS 38.213] or when PDSCH transmission is scheduled with SI-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI or RA-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1. The UE is not expected to be configured with referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2 for serving cells configured for cross-carrier scheduling with a scheduling cell of a different downlink SCS configuration. When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' and indicated DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the number of PDSCH transmission occasions is derived by the number of TCI states indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' of the scheduling DCI. - If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication', the UE is expected to receive two PDSCH transmission occasions, where the first TCI state is applied to the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1. The second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion, and the second PDSCH transmission occasion shall have the same number of symbols as the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the UE is configured by the higher layers with a value \\bar{K} in StartingSymbolOffsetK, it shall determine that the first symbol of the second PDSCH transmission occasion starts after \\bar{K} symbols from the last symbol of the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the value \\bar{K} is not configured via the higher layer parameter StartingSymbolOffsetK, \\bar{K}=0 shall be assumed by the UE. The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion. For two PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where n=0,1 applied respectively to the first and second TCI state. The UE expects the PDSCH mapping type indicated by DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' to be mapping type B , and the indicated PDSCH mapping type is applied to both PDSCH transmission occasions. - Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause 5.1.2.1. When a UE configured by the higher layer parameter PDSCH-config that indicates at least one entry contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation, - If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' together with the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocation and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the repetitionNumber consecutive slots, the first TCI state is applied to the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1.\n---\n\\end{table} - If one TCI state is indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' together with the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocation and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the repetitionNumber consecutive slots, the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1, the same TCI state is applied to all PDSCH transmission occasions. The UE may expect that each PDSCH transmission occasion is limited to two transmission layers. For all PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where n is counted considering PDSCH transmission occasions. - Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause 5.1.2.1. For [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17] in pdsch-Config each PDSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and K_{0} . The number of scheduled PDSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 signalled in DCI format 1_1. If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is indicated re-transmission of PDSCH corresponding to a DL SPS by DCI format 1_1, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 by the DCI is more than one.\n---\n\\multirow[t]{3}{*}{G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI (for multicast)} & \\multirow[t]{3}{*}{Type-X common search space for multiast} & 1,2, 3 & No & - & No & { }^{-} & Default A & & 1,2, 3 & Yes & - & No & { }^{-} & pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList provided in PDSCH-ConfigCommon (Note 1) & & 1,2, 3 & No/Ye s & - & Yes & - & pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList provided in pdsch-Config-Multicast (Note 1) \\multicolumn{8}{|l|}{\\begin{tabular}{l} Note 1: For a UE that supports multicast, the same TDRA table applies to all G-RNTIs (configured for multicast) if configured on a given serving cell.

The UE shall assume that when the scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1 \\_0,4 \\_0 or 4 \\_1 then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource assignment' field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 1 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-1-2 in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 1 _2 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 4_2, the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config for DCI format 1 \\_1 or by the higher layer parameter ETSI\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) resourceAllocationDCI-1-2 for DCI format 1 _2 or by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast for DCI format 4_2. If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1 \\_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 , the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. 5.1.2.2.1 Downlink resource allocation type 0 In downlink resource allocation of type 0 , the resource block assignment information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups (RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter rbg-Size configured by PDSCH-Config and the size of the bandwidth part as defined in Table 5.1.2.2.1-1. \\begin{table}\n---\n- the size of all other RBGs is P . In downlink resource allocation of type 0 scheduled using a DCI with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the resource block assignment information bitmap is calculated based on the description above with the following changes: the parameter N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {start }} is the starting PRB of the CFR, N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {size }} is the size of the common frequency resource (CFR) and the value of the higher layer parameter rbg-Size is configured by PDSCH-Config-Multicast. The bitmap is of size N_{\\text {RBG }} bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each RBG is addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing frequency and starting at the lowest frequency of the bandwidth part. The order of RBG bitmap is such that RBG 0 to RBG N_{\\text {RBG }}-1 are mapped from MSB to LSB. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the corresponding bit value in the bitmap is 1 , the RBG is not allocated to the UE otherwise.\n---\nIf N_{C F R}>N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }}, K is the maximum value from set \\{1,2,4,6,8,10,12\\} which satisfies \\mathrm{K} <= \\left\\lfloor N_{C F R} / N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }}\\right\\rfloor ; otherwise K=1 . In downlink resource allocation of type 1 scheduled using DCI format 42 with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CSRNTI, the description in clause 5.1.2.2.2 with the following changes: R \\bar{B}_{\\text {sart }} corresponds to a starting resource block in reference to the lowest RB of the CFR and N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {size }} is the size of the CFR. 5.1.2.3 Physical resource block (PRB) bundling The PRB bundling procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of prb-BundlingTypeDCI-1-2 instead of prb-BundingType as well as vrb-ToPRB-InterleaverDCI-1-2 instead of vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver. The PRB bundling procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4_2, by applying the parameters of prb-BundlingType given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast as well as vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast. A UE may assume that precoding granularity is P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} consecutive resource blocks in the frequency domain. P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} can be equal to one of the values among \\{2,4 , wideband \\} .\n---\nA UE expects a configuration provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon to be same as a configuration provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or PDSCHs with SPS, the REs corresponding to the configured or dynamically indicated resources in Clauses 5.1.4.1, 5.1.4.2 are not available for PDSCH. Furthermore, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources, and the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted. A UE is not expected to handle the case where PDSCH DM-RS REs are overlapping, even partially, with any RE(s) not available for PDSCH. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst represents all of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks corresponding to SS/PBCH block indices provided by ssbPositionsInBurst as described in Clause 4.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. 5.1.4.1 PDSCH resource mapping with RB symbol level granularity The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternGrouplDCI-1-2, rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 instead of rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup2. The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\ldots 0 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4_1, and the procedures for PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4 _ 2 by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternToAddModList, rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup 2 configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast. A UE may be configured with any of the following higher layer parameters indicating REs declared as not available for PDSCH:\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} rateMatchPatternGroup2, rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 The IDs of a second group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP Ievel) or in ServingCellConfig >rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). The field rateMatchPatternGroup2 applies to DCI format 1_1, and the field rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 applies to DCI format 1 _ 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} rateMatchPatternToAddModList Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around.
