If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH. 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity\n---\n- an indication for a presence or absence of a transmission configuration indication (TCI) field for a DCI format, other than DCI format 1 \\_0 , that schedules PDSCH receptions or has associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH and is provided by a PDCCH in CORESET p , by tci-PresentInDCI or tci-PresentDC1-1-2. When precoderGranularity = allContiguousRBs, a UE does not expect - to be configured a set of resource blocks of a CORESET that includes more than four sub-sets of resource blocks that are not contiguous in frequency - any RE of a CORESET to overlap with any RE determined from lte-CRS-ToMatchAround, or from LTE-CRSPatternList, or with any RE of a SS/PBCH block. If a UE is provided two TCI states indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in a CORESET associated with a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, the UE may assume the quasi co-location information indicated in both of the two TCI states for the PDCCH reception in the CORESET. For each CORESET in a DL BWP of a serving cell, a respective frequencyDomainResources provides a bitmap - if a CORESET is not associated with any search space set configured with freqMonitorLocations, the bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending order of the PRB index in the DL BWP bandwidth of N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\mathrm{BWP}} PRBs with starting common RB position N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {start }} , where the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index 6 \\cdot\\left[N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {start }} / 6\\right] if r b -Offset is not provided, or the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {start }}+N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} where N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} is provided by rb-Offset. - if a CORESET is associated with at least one search space set configured with freqMonitorLocations, the first N_{\\text {RBG }, \\text { set0 }}^{\\text {size }} bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending order of the PRB index in each RB set k in the DL BWP bandwidth of N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\mathrm{BWP}} PRBs with starting common RB position R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu} [6, TS 38.214], where the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu}+N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} and k is indicated by freqMonitorLocations if provided for a search space set; otherwise, k=0 .
