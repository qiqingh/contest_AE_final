    "evidence": "176 ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - Time domain behaviour of SRS resource configuration as indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType, which may be periodic, semi-persistent, aperiodic SRS transmission as defined in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher layer parameters periodicityAndOffset- p or periodicityAndOffset-sp for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource set SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet with different slot level periodicities. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a list of zero up to four different available slot offset values from the reference slot n+k to the slot where the aperiodic SRS resource set is transmitted where n is the slot with triggering DCI and k is SlotOffset is defined by the higher layer parameter AvailableSlotOffset. The parameter AvailableSlotOffset can be configured up to 4 different values. For an SRSPosResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', the slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset for each SRS resource. - Number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource, starting OFDM symbol of the SRS resource within a slot including repetition factor R as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceMapping and described in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If R is not configured, then R is equal to the number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource. - SRS bandwidth B_{S R S} and C_{S R S} , as defined by the higher layer parameter freqHopping and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then B_{\\text {SRS }}=0 . - Frequency hopping bandwidth b_{\\text {hop }} , as defined by the higher layer parameter freqHopping and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then b_{\\text {hop }}=0 . - Defining partial frequency sounding factor and start RB index for partial frequency sounding as defined by the higher layer parameters FreqScalingFactor \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{F}} and StartRBIndex k_{\\mathrm{F}} , respectively, and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, then P_{F}=1 and k_{F}=0 . - Defining start RB index hopping for partial frequency sounding in different SRS frequency hopping periods for aperiodic/periodic/semi-persistent SRS based on the hopping pattern k_{\\text {hopping }} as described in clause 6.4.1.4.3 in [4, TS 38.211. If not configured, then start RB hopping is not enabled and k_{\\text {hoppng }} is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. - Defining frequency domain position and configurable shift, as defined by the higher layer parameters freqDomainPosition and freqDomainShift, respectively, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If freqDomainPosition is not configured, freqDomainPosition is zero. - Cyclic shift, as defined by the higher layer parameter cyclicShift-n2, cyclicShift-n4, or cyclicShift-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4 or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb value, as defined by the higher layer parameter transmission Comb described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb offset, as defined by the higher layer parameter combOffset-n2, combOffset-n4, and combOffset-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4, or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - SRS sequence ID, as defined by the higher layer parameter sequenceld in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - The configuration of the spatial relation between a reference R S and the target S R S , where the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, if configured, contains the ID of the reference RS. The reference RS may be an SS/PBCH block, CSI-RS configured on serving cell indicated by higher layer parameter servingCellId if present, same serving cell as the target SRS otherwise, or an SRS configured on uplink BWP indicated by the higher layer parameter uplinkBWP, and serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter servingCellld if present, same serving cell as the target SRS otherwise. When the target SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, the reference RS may also be a DL PRS configured on a serving cell or a non-serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter dl-PRS, or an SS/PBCH block of a non-serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter ssb-Ncell. If the UE is configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or ULTCIState, the reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell.",
