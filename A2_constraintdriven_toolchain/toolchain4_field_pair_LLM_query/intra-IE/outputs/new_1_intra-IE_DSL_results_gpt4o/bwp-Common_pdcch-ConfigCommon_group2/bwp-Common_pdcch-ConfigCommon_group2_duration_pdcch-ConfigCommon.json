    "evidence": "If a UE is provided by bwp-InactivityTimer a timer value for the serving cell [11, TS 38.321] and the timer is running, the UE decrements the timer at the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a half subframe for FR2 if the restarting conditions in [11, TS 38.321] are not met during the interval of the subframe for FR1 or of the half subframe for FR2. For a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity timer expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP change or the active UL BWP change required by the UE [10, TS 38.133], the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a subframe for FR2, that is immediately after the BWP inactivity timer expires until the beginning of a slot where the UE can receive or transmit. When a UE's BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit for an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different cell within FR1 (or FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change triggered by the BWP inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for FR1 or half a subframe for FR2 that is immediately after the UE completes the active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in the different cell within FR1 (or FR2). If a UE is provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP on the carrier of the secondary cell.

The symbols of the CORESET associated with pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or with searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCHConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix.
