The UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for the set S_{0} followed by the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for the set S_{1} to obtain a total number of O_{\\text {ACK }} HARQ-ACK information bits. If a UE is provided fdmed-Reception-Multicast and the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of unicast DCI formats and to monitor PDCCH for detection of multicast DCI formats - a serving cell is placed in a first set S_{\\mathrm{U}} of N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\text {DLU }} serving cells if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI formats 1 \\_0 / 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 for scheduling on serving cell c , and - a serving cell is placed in a second set S_{\\mathrm{M}} of N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL} \\mathrm{M}} serving cells if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 4_1/4_2 for scheduling on serving cell c , and\n---\nIf the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 . If the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency resource, and if the UE is provided searchSpaceBroadcast for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for Type3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the active DL BWP. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided ra-SearchSpace for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, or a Type1APDCCH CSS set, or a USS set and the UE has received a C-RNTI and has been provided a Typel-PDCCH CSS set, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0 \\_0 and DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI in the Type1-PDCCH CSS set. If a UE is not provided pagingSearchSpace for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If a UE is not provided peiSearchSpace for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2APDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If the UE is provided peiSearchSpace with zero value for the Type2A-PDCCH CSS set index, and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13. If a UE is provided a zero value for searchSpaceID in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or is not provided searchSpaceBroadcast, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 13, and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE monitors PDCCH\n---\ncandidates only at monitoring occasions associated with a SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block is determined by the most recent of - a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that includes a CORESET with index 0 , as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block, or - a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.",
