All CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots.\n---\n- \\left[b_{2} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=4 f(i) for row 4 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 - \\left[b_{5} \\cdots b_{0}\\right], k_{i-1}=2 f(i) for all other cases where f(i) is the bit number of the i^{\\text {th }} bit in the bitmap set to one, repeated across every [1 / \\rho] of the resource blocks configured for CSI-RS reception by the UE.
