    "evidence": "the UE may assume that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE. If a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _2 is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-J-2 or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-J-2 or a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 or DCI format 1 \\_1 is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCHMappingTypeB, the UE may assume that the following configurations are not occurring simultaneously for the received PDSCH: - any DM-RS ports among 1004-1007 or 1006-1011 for DM-RS configurations type 1 and type 2, respectively are scheduled for the UE and the other UE(s) sharing the DM-RS REs on the same CDM group(s), and - PT-RS is transmitted to the UE. The UE is not expected to simultaneously be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter maxLength being set equal to 'len2' and more than one additional DM-RS symbol as given by the higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition. The UE is not expected to assume co-scheduled UE(s) with different DM-RS configuration with respect to the actual number of front-loaded DM-RS symbol(s), the actual number of additional DM-RS, the DM-RS symbol location, and DM-RS configuration type as described in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211]. The UE does not expect the precoding of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be different in the PRG-level grid configured to this UE with PRG =2 or 4 . The UE does not expect the resource allocation of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be misaligned in the PRG-level grid to this UE with PRG=2 or 4 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _1, the UE shall assume that the CDM groups indicated in the configured index from Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-2A, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] contain potential co-scheduled downlink DM-RS and are not used for data transmission, where \" 1 \", \" 2 \" and \" 3 \" for the number of DM-RS CDM group(s) in Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] correspond to CDM group 0,\\{0,1\\},\\{0,1,2\\} , respectively.",
