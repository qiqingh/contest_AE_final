    "evidence": "The MAC sublayer provides data transfer services on logical channels. To accommodate different kinds of data transfer services, multiple types of logical channels are defined i.e. each supporting transfer of a particular type of information. Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred. The MAC sublayer provides the control and traffic channels listed in Table 4.5.3-1 below.\n---\nNOTE 4: If there is configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication, and prioritization-related information is not available prior to the time of the transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed. 5.4.3 Multiplexing and assembly 5.4.3.1 Logical Channel Prioritization 5.4.3.1.1 General\n---\n4> SL data for NR sidelink discovery is available for transmission; and 4>S B j>0 , in case there is any logical channel having S B j>0 ; and 4> sl-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and\n---\nNOTE: The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of ASN. 1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the \"default radio configuration\" in accordance with this clause. 9.1 Specified configurations 9.1.1 Logical channel configurations 9.1.1.1 BCCH configuration\n---\nAn RLC entity receives/delivers RLC SDUs from/to upper layer and sends/receives RLC PDUs to/from its peer RLC entity via lower layers. An RLC PDU can either be an RLC data PDU or an RLC control PDU. If an RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer, it receives them through a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer, and after forming RLC data PDUs from the received RLC SDUs, the RLC entity submits the RLC data PDUs to lower layer through a single logical channel. If an RLC entity receives RLC data PDUs from lower layer, it receives them through a single logical channel, and after forming RLC SDUs from the received RLC data PDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC SDUs to upper layer through a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer. If an RLC entity submits/receives RLC control PDUs to/from lower layer, it submits/receives them through the same logical channel it submits/receives the RLC data PDUs through. An RLC entity can be configured to perform data transfer in one of the following three modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM) or Acknowledged Mode (AM). Consequently, an RLC entity is categorized as a TM RLC entity, an UM RLC entity or an AM RLC entity depending on the mode of data transfer that the RLC entity is configured to provide.\n---\n3> if Random Access Preambles group B is configured: 4 if the potential Msg3 size (UL data available for transmission plus MAC subheader(s) and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than ra-Msg3SizeGroupA and the pathloss is less than PCMAX (of the Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) - preambleReceivedTargetPower - msg3DeltaPreamble - messagePowerOffsetGroupB; or 4- if the Random Access procedure was initiated for the CCCH logical channel and the CCCH SDU size plus MAC subheader is greater than ra-Msg3SizeGroupA: 5> select the Random Access Preambles group B. 4> else:\n---\n1> if this is the first MSGA transmission within this Random Access procedure: 2> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel: 3> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission. 2> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery and spCell-BFR-CBRA with value true is configured:\n---\n5> set the TEMPORARY_C-RNTI to the value received in the Random Access Response; 5> if this is the first successfully received Random Access Response within this Random Access procedure: 6> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel: 7> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission. 6> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery and spCell B F R-C B R A with value true is configured:\n---\n3> stop the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running; 3> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity; 3> if a logical channel associated with a DRB configured with survivalTimeStateSupport is multiplexed in the MAC PDU stored in the HARQ buffer for the corresponding HARQ process: 4> trigger activation of PDCP duplication for all configured RLC entities of the DRB. 2> else if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0 :\n---\n- allowedHARQ-mode which sets the allowed UL HARQ mode for transmission. The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization procedure: - Bj which is maintained for each logical channel j. The MAC entity shall initialize Bj of the logical channel to zero when the logical channel is established.\n---\n5.4.3.1.3 Allocation of resources Before the successful completion of the Random Access procedure initiated for DAPS handover, the target MAC entity shall not select the logical channel(s) corresponding to non-DAPS DRB(s) for the uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or the uplink grant for the transmission of the MSGA payload. The source MAC entity shall select only the logical channel(s) corresponding to DAPS DRB(s) during DAPS handover. The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:\n---\nNOTE 2: Prioritization among MAC CEs of same priority is up to UE implementation. The MAC entity shall prioritize any MAC CE listed in a higher order than 'data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH' over NR sidelink transmission. 5.4.3.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to clauses 5.4.3.1 and 6.1.2. NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome. 5.4.4 Scheduling Request The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission. The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured. Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or a DSR (clause 5.4.9) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request (clause 5.25 ) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8).",
