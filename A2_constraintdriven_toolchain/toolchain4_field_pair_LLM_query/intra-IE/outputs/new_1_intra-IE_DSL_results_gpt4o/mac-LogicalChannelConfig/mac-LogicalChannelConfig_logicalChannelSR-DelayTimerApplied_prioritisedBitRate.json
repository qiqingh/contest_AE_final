RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical channel per MAC entity: - priority where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level; - prioritisedBitRate which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR); - bucketSizeDuration which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD).\n---\nNOTE: Sidelink data for discovery and sidelink data for non-discovery transmitted by a UE cannot be multiplexed into the same TB because they are always associated with different destination L2 IDs (see TS 23.304 [26]). 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization 5.22.1.4.1.1 General The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed.
