RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical channel per MAC entity: - priority where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level; - prioritisedBitRate which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR); - bucketSizeDuration which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD).\n---\n4> SL data for NR sidelink discovery is available for transmission; and 4>S B j>0 , in case there is any logical channel having S B j>0 ; and 4> sl-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and 4> sl-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant. 2> else if the new transmission is associated to a sidelink grant in s l -TxPoolSelectedNormal configured in s l -BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWP-PoolConfigCommonA2X: 3> select a Destination associated with BRID if sl-A2X-Service in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal indicates brid or bridAndDAA or select a Destination associated with DAA if sl-A2X-Service in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal indicates daa or bridAndDAA as specified in TS 23.256 [31], and the logical channel with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions for the SL grant associated to the SCI: 4> SL data for A2X communication is available for transmission; and 4> S B j>0 , in case there is any logical channel having S B j>0 .\n---\nNOTE 5: If c g -RetransmissionTimer is not configured, a HARQ process is not shared between different configured grant configurations in the same BWP. For the MAC entity configured with lch-basedPrioritization, priority of an uplink grant is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5-4.3.1.2. The priority of an uplink grant for which no data for logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than either the priority of an uplink grant for which data for any logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU or the priority of the logical channel triggering an SR. For the MAC entity configured with lch-basedPrioritization, if the corresponding PUSCH transmission of a configured uplink grant is cancelled by CI-RNTI as specified in clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [6] or cancelled by a high PHY-priority PUCCH transmission as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6], this configured uplink grant is considered as a deprioritized uplink grant. If this de-prioritized uplink grant is configured with autonomousTx, the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running. If this deprioritized uplink grant is configured with autonomousTx, the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running.\n---\n5.4.3.1.1 General The Logical Channel Prioritization (LCP) procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed.

Does not apply to logical channels associated with a DRB configured with PDCP duplication within the same MAC entity (i.e. CA duplication) when CA duplication is deactivated for this DRB in this MAC entity; and 2> allowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the UL grant; and 2> allowedPHY-PriorityIndex, if configured, includes the priority index (as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6]) associated to the dynamic UL grant; and 2> allowedHARQ-mode, if configured, includes the allowed UL HARQ mode for the HARQ process associated to the UL grant. NOTE: The Subcarrier Spacing index, PUSCH transmission duration, Cell information, and priority index are included in Uplink transmission information received from lower layers for the corresponding scheduled uplink transmission. 5.4.3.1.3 Allocation of resources Before the successful completion of the Random Access procedure initiated for DAPS handover, the target MAC entity shall not select the logical channel(s) corresponding to non-DAPS DRB(s) for the uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or the uplink grant for the transmission of the MSGA payload. The source MAC entity shall select only the logical channel(s) corresponding to DAPS DRB(s) during DAPS handover. The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:\n---\n3> if the MAC entity is able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SLSCH resource; or 3> if the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary CRNTI or with the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4 .5 overlaps with any other UL-SCH resource(s), and the physical layer can signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant(s) for any UL-SCH resource(s) where the uplink grant was not already de-prioritized and its simultaneous transmission with the SR is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCHgroups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePrioritySecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the uplink grant is determined as specified in clause 5.4.1; or 3> if both sl-PrioritizationThres and ul-PrioritizationThres are configured and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 overlaps with any UL-SCH resource(s) carrying a MAC PDU, and the value of the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is lower than sl-PrioritizationThres and the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU is higher than or equal to ul-PrioritizationThres and any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3 is not included in the MAC PDU and the MAC PDU is not prioritized by upper layer according to TS 23.287 [19]; or\n---\nETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08) Each logical channel may be allocated to an LCG using the logicalChannelGroup. The maximum number of LCGs is eight except for [AB-MTs configured with logicalChannelGrouplAB-Ext, for which the maximum number of LCGs is 256. The MAC entity determines the amount of UL data available for a logical channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3] and 38.323 [4]. A BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur for activated cell group: - UL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG, becomes available to the MAC entity; and either - this UL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the priority of any logical channel containing available UL data which belong to any LCG; or - none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains any available UL data. in which case the BSR is referred below to as 'Regular BSR';\n---\n4> indicate to the physical layer RB set information for which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was detected and not cancelled as specified in clause 5.31.2. 3> if the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure was triggered in above and one or more carriers have been (re-)selected in the TX carrier (re-)selection according to clause 5.22.1.11: 4> determine the order of the (re-)selected carriers, according to the decreasing order based on the highest priority of logical channels which are allowed on each (re-)selected carrier, and perform the resource selection procedure as specified in this clause for each Sidelink process on each (re-)selected carrier according to the order. 3> if one or multiple SL DRX(s) is configured in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data: 4> indicate to the physical layer SL DRX Active time in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data, as specified in clause 5.28.2. NOTE 3A: The MAC entity selects a value for the resource reservation interval which is larger than the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel or remaining SL-PRS delay budget. The value of the SL-PRS delay budget is provided by the UE's own upper layers by implementation. 3> randomly select, with equal probability, an integer value in the interval [5,15] for the resource reservation interval higher than or equal to 100 ms or in the interval \\left[5 \\times\\left\\lceil\\frac{100}{\\max \\left(20, P_{\\text {rsvp_Tx }}\\right)}\\right\\rceil, 15 \\times\\left\\lceil\\frac{100}{\\max \\left(20, P_{\\text {rsvp_Tx }}\\right)}\\right\\rceil\\right] for the resource reservation interval lower than 100 ms and set SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER to the selected value; 3> if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:\n---\n5> else: 6> set the HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator to disabled. 5> set the priority to the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s), if any, and MAC CE(s), if included, in the MAC PDU and SL-PRS, if any; ETSI\n---\n3> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6]. 2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU, and no sidelink grant is available for next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU (including immediately after all PSSCH duration(s) in an sl-PeriodCG for the sidelink grant, the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has not reached s /-MaxTransNum corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU, if configured in s /-C G MaxTransNumList for the sidelink grant by RRC), if any; or 2> else if PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for one or more retransmissions of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent:\n---\nETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08) 1> if u -PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of the highest priority of logical channel(s) of all the NR uplink transmission(s) is not lower than u -PrioritizationThres, and 1> if s -PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of SL-PRS priority is lower than sl-PrioritizationThres. 5.22.1.4 Multiplexing and assembly\n---\n1> if u -PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of the highest priority of logical channel(s) of all the NR uplink transmission(s) is not lower than u -PrioritizationThres, and 1> if s -PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of SL-PRS priority is lower than sl-PrioritizationThres. 5.22.1.4 Multiplexing and assembly 5.22.1.4.0 General For PDU(s) associated with one SCI, MAC shall consider only logical channels with the same Source Layer-2 [DDestination Layer-2 [D pair for one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast which is associated with the pair. Multiple transmissions for different Sidelink processes are allowed to be independently performed in different PSSCH durations. NOTE: Sidelink data for discovery and sidelink data for non-discovery transmitted by a UE cannot be multiplexed into the same TB because they are always associated with different destination L2 IDs (see TS 23.304 [26]). 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization 5.22.1.4.1.1 General The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed.
