Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol i is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than N symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of N depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\mu with N=13 for \\mu=0, N=13 for \\mu=1, N=20 for \\mu=2, N=24 for \\mu=3, N=96 for \\mu=5 , and N=192 for \\mu=6 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) symbol S is relative to the starting symbol S_{0} of the PDCCH monitoring occasion where DCI format 1 \\_2 is detected; when the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time is used for the purpose of determining the starting symbol S_{0} ; - otherwise, the starting symbol S is relative to the start of the slot using S_{0}=0 . - The number of consecutive symbols L counting from the starting symbol S allocated for the PDSCH are determined from the start and length indicator SLIV:\n---\n& & 1,2, 3 & No/Ye s & - & Yes & - & pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList provided in PDSCH-Config-MTCH, if configured, otherwise TimeDomainAllocationList provided in PDSCH-Config-MCCH \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{C-RNTI, MCS-CRNTI, CSRNTI} & & 1, 2, 3 & No & - & - & - & Default A & Any common search space associated with CORESET 0 & 1, 2, 3 & Yes & - & - & - & pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList provided in PDSCH-ConfigCommon \\multirow[t]{4}{*}{C-RNTI, MCS-CRNTI, CSRNTI} & \\multirow{4}{*}{Any common search space not associated with CORESET 0 UE specific search space} & 1,2, 3 & No & No & - & - & Default A & & 1,2, 3 & Yes & No & - & - & pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList provided in PDSCH-ConfigCommon",
