    "evidence": "A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 . A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0 . The UE is also configured a periodicity S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} in symbols or slots and an offset S R_{\\text {OFFSET }} in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu}[4 , TS 38.211] in a frame with number n_{f} if \\left(n_{f} \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\\mu}-S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 . If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is one slot, the UE expects that S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}=0 and every slot is a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH.",
