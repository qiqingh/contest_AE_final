If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1 \\_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 , the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. 5.1.2.2.1 Downlink resource allocation type 0\n---\n5.1.2.2.2 Downlink resource allocation type 1 In downlink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated non-interleaved or interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part of size N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} PRBs except for the case when DCI format 1_0 is decoded in any common search space in which case the size of CORESET 0 shall be used if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell and the size of initial DL bandwidth part shall be used if CORESET 0 is not configured for the cell. ETSI\n---\nThe UE may assume the same precoding is applied for any downlink contiguous allocation of PRBs in a PRG. For PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .

When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1. For a bitmap pair included in one or two groups of resource sets, the dynamic indication of availability for PDSCH applies to a set of slot(s) where the rateMatchPatternToAddModList is present among the slots of scheduled PDSCH. If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 with the same starting CCE index in noninterleaved CORESET spanning one OFDM symbol: - and if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH has aggregation level 8 , the resources corresponding to the aggregation level 16 PDCCH candidate are not available for the PDSCH ; - when at least one of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 linked as indicated by higher layer parameter searchSpaceLinking, the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 16 and any other PDCCH candidate(s) linked with any of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 and 16 are not available for the PDSCH reception at the UE, if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH is associated with the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 or 16 . If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH. 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the TCI state or QCL assumption whichever is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell. When a UE is configured with both sfnSchemePdcch and sfnSchemePdsch scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 or by DCI format 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 , if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable: - if the UE supports DCI scheduling without TCI field, the UE assumes that the TCI state(s) or the QCL assumption(s) for the PDSCH is identical to the TCI state(s) or QCL assumption(s) whichever is applied for the CORESET used for the reception of the DL DCI within the active BWP of the serving cell regardless of the number of active TCI states of the CORESET. If the UE does not support dynamic switching between SFN PDSCH and non-SFN PDSCH, the UE should be activated with the CORESET with two TCI states. - else if the UE does not support DCI scheduling without TCI field, the UE shall expect TCI field present when scheduled by DCI format 1_1/1_2. When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch and sfnSchemePdcch is not configured, when scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 , if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable, the UE shall expect TCI field present. For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,1 \\_2 , when a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and sfnSchemePdsch is not configured, and there is no TCI codepoint with two TCI states in the activation command, and if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal or larger than the threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable and the CORESET which schedules the PDSCH is indicated with two TCI states, the UE assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the first TCI state or QCL assumption which is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell. If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) , and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) . When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL. Independent of the configuration of tci-PresentInDCI and tci-PresentDCI-1-2 in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL and at least one configured TCI state for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains qci-Type set to 'typeD',\n---\nThe CSI-RS defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], may be used for time/frequency tracking, CSI computation, L1-RSRP computation, L1-SINR computation, mobility, and tracking during fast SCell activation. For a CSI-RS resource associated with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on', the UE shall not expect to be configured with CSI-RS over the symbols during which the UE is also configured to monitor the CORESET, while for other NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configurations, if the UE is configured with a CSI-RS resource and a search space set associated with a CORESET in the same OFDM symbol(s), the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and a PDCCH DM-RS transmitted in all the search space sets associated with CORESET are quasi co-located with 'typeD', if 'typeD' is applicable. If the CORESET is activated with two TCI states, UE may assume that the first TCI state of the CORESET as the default QCL assumption for the CSI-RS. This also applies to the case when CSI-RS and the CORESET are in different intra-band component carriers, if 'typeD' is applicable.
