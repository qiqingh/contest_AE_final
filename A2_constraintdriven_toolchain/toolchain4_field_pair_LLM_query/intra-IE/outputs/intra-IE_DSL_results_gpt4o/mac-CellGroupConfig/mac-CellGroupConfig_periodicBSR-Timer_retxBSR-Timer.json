For BSR triggered by retxBSR-Timer expiry, the MAC entity considers that the logical channel that triggered the BSR is the highest priority logical channel that has data available for transmission at the time the BSR is triggered. The MAC entity shall: 1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR has been triggered and not cancelled: 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization: 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BSR MAC CE(s) as defined in clause 6.1.3.1; 3> start or restart periodicBSR-Timer except when all the generated BSRs are long or short Truncated or Extended long or short Truncated BSRs; 3> start or restart retxBSR-Timer.\n---\nA MAC PDU shall contain at most one SL-BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have triggered an SL-BSR. The Regular SL-BSR and the Periodic SL-BSR shall have precedence over the padding SL-BSR. The MAC entity shall restart sl-retxBSR-Timer upon reception of an SL grant for transmission of new data on any SLSCH. All triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and s l -retx-BSR-Timer and s l -periodic-BSR-Timer shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2. NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.",
