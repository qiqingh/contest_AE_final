Band width, nrofRBs, and the initial CRB index, startingRB, of the NZP CSI-RS resource configured by TRS-ResourceSet are not restricted by initial DL BWP. - UE is not required to receive TRS occasions outside the initial DL BWP. - the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet. - the UE does not expect the TRS-ResourceSet to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of NZP CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the UE may assume the sub-carrier spacing of the NZP CSI-RS resources configured by TRS-ResourceSet to be same as the sub-carrier spacing of the initial DL BWP. - powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - the QCL information for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter s s b -Index configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is a SS/PBCH block, applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - One or more scramblingIDs where if a single scramblingID is configured, it applies to all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the resource set, otherwise, each NZP-CSI-RS resource is provided with a scramblingID. - the UE may assume the following quasi co-location type(s): - 'typeC' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same SS/PBCH block.",
