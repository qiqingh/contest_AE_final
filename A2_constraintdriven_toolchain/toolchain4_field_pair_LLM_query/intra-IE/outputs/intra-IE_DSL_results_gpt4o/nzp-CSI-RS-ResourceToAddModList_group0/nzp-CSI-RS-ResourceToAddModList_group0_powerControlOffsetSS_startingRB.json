    "evidence": "- where the first symbol location in a slot is indicated by firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain in the TRSResourceSet and the second symbol location in a slot is firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain +4 - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211]. - the band width and the frequency location of the NZP CSI-RS resource, is given by the higher layer parameter nrofRBs, startingRB and frequencyDomainAllocation in a TRS-ResourceSet and applies to all resources in a TRSResourceSet. Band width, nrofRBs, and the initial CRB index, startingRB, of the NZP CSI-RS resource configured by TRS-ResourceSet are not restricted by initial DL BWP. - UE is not required to receive TRS occasions outside the initial DL BWP. - the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet. - the UE does not expect the TRS-ResourceSet to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of NZP CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the UE may assume the sub-carrier spacing of the NZP CSI-RS resources configured by TRS-ResourceSet to be same as the sub-carrier spacing of the initial DL BWP. - powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - the QCL information for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter s s b -Index configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is a SS/PBCH block, applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - One or more scramblingIDs where if a single scramblingID is configured, it applies to all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the resource set, otherwise, each NZP-CSI-RS resource is provided with a scramblingID.\n---\n- cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'. All CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots.",
