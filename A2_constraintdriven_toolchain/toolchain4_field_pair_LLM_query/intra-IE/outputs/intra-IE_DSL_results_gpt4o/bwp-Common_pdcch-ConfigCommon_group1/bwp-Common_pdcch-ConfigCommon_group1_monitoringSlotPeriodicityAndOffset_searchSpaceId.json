    "evidence": "the duration of periodicityAndPattern in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1. For a bitmap pair included in one or two groups of resource sets, the dynamic indication of availability for PDSCH applies to a set of slot(s) where the rateMatchPatternToAddModList is present among the slots of scheduled PDSCH. If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 with the same starting CCE index in noninterleaved CORESET spanning one OFDM symbol: - and if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH has aggregation level 8 , the resources corresponding to the aggregation level 16 PDCCH candidate are not available for the PDSCH ; - when at least one of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 linked as indicated by higher layer parameter searchSpaceLinking, the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 16 and any other PDCCH candidate(s) linked with any of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 and 16 are not available for the PDSCH reception at the UE, if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH is associated with the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 or 16 . If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH. 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity\n---\neach with same activated tci-StatelD value, to CORESETs with a same index in all configured DL BWPs of all configured cells in a list determined from a serving cell index, where one or two tci-StateID, the CORESET index, and the serving cell index are provided by a MAC CE command. For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE is provided by higher layers with S <= 10 search space sets where, for each search space set from the S search space sets, the UE is provided the following by SearchSpace: - a search space set index s, 0<s<40 , by searchSpaceld - an association between the search space set s and a CORESET p by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610 - a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of k_{s} slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of o_{s} slots, by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset or by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 - a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the CORESET for PDCCH monitoring within each slot where the UE monitors PDCCH, by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot - a duration of T_{s}<k_{s} indicating a number of slots that the search space set s exists by duration, or a number of slots in consecutive groups of slots where the search space set s can exist by duration-r 17\n---\nA SFI-index field value in a DCI format 20 indicates to a UE a slot format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 \\_0 . The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The SFI-index field includes \\max \\left\\{\\left[\\log _{2}(\\operatorname{maxSFI}\\right.\\right. inde \\left.\\left.x+1)\\right], 1\\right\\} bits where maxSFlindex is the maximum value of the values provided by corresponding slotFormatCombinationId. A slot format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where ' D ' denotes a downlink symbol, 'U' denotes an uplink symbol, and ' F ' denotes a flexible symbol. If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot. A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2 \\_0 on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.\n---\n- SearchSpace The IE SearchSpace defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates. Each search space is associated with one ControlResourceSet. For a scheduled SCell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent (regardless of their presence conditions). For a scheduled SpCell in the case of the cross carrier scheduling, if the search space is linked to another search space in the scheduling SCell, all the optional fields of this search space in the scheduled SpCell are absent (regardless of their presence conditions) except for nrofCandidates. SearchSpace information element -- ASNISTART -- TAG-SEARCHSPACE-START SearchSpace ::= search SpaceId controlResourceSetId. monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset sll sl2\n---\nduration Number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The UE ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity- 1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). For IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). freqMonitorLocations Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set. monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 \\_0 , only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8' and 'sl10' are applicable.\n---\nFor IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). freqMonitorLocations Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set. monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 \\_0 , only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8' and 'sl10' are applicable. For IAB-MT, If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sI1', 'sI2' or 'sI4' are applicable. If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2 \\_0 or DCI format 2_5, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213, clause 10).\n---\nNumber of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific value is provided (see inside searchSpaceType). If configured in the SearchSpace of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). searchSpaceGroupldList List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0 or 1. If searchSpaceGroup/dList (i.e. without suffix) is included. The network configures at most 3 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0,1 or 2 if searchSpaceGroup/dList-r17 is included. And if searchSpaceGroupldList-r17 is included, searchSpaceGroupldList (i.e. without suffix) is ignored. searchSpaceld Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceld =0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceld is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceld in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active. For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT:each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet; for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent. SearchSpaceLinkingld This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. searchSpaceType Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.\n---\nConditional Presence & Explanation Setup & This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new SearchSpace.
