If not configured, then start RB hopping is not enabled and k_{\\text {hoppng }} is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. - Defining frequency domain position and configurable shift, as defined by the higher layer parameters freqDomainPosition and freqDomainShift, respectively, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If freqDomainPosition is not configured, freqDomainPosition is zero. - Cyclic shift, as defined by the higher layer parameter cyclicShift-n2, cyclicShift-n4, or cyclicShift-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4 or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb value, as defined by the higher layer parameter transmission Comb described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb offset, as defined by the higher layer parameter combOffset-n2, combOffset-n4, and combOffset-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4, or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - SRS sequence ID, as defined by the higher layer parameter sequenceld in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - The configuration of the spatial relation between a reference R S and the target S R S , where the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, if configured, contains the ID of the reference RS. The reference RS may be an SS/PBCH block, CSI-RS configured on serving cell indicated by higher layer parameter servingCellId if present, same serving cell as the target SRS otherwise, or an SRS configured on uplink BWP indicated by the higher layer parameter uplinkBWP, and serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter servingCellld if present, same serving cell as the target SRS otherwise. When the target SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, the reference RS may also be a DL PRS configured on a serving cell or a non-serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter dl-PRS, or an SS/PBCH block of a non-serving cell indicated by the higher layer parameter ssb-Ncell. If the UE is configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or ULTCIState, the reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell.",
