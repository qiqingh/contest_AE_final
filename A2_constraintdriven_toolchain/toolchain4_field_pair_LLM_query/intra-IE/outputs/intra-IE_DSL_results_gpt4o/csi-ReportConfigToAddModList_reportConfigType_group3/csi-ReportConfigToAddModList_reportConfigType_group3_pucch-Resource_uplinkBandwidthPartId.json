A UE is not expected to receive a DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activating one semipersistent CSI report with the same CSI-ReportConfigId as in semi-persistent CSI report which is activated by a previously received DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI. For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH.

Supporting Type II CSI reporting on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 is a UE capability type2-SP-CSI-Feedback-LongPUCCH. A Type II CSI report (Part 1 only) carried on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 shall be calculated independently of any Type II CSI reports carried on the PUSCH (see Clause 5.2.3). When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP. If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended.\n---\n6.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical uplink shared channel PUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell. The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nwhere the RS resource is either on serving cell c or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking - If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , and - if two spatial settings from PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo are activated for a PUCCH resource with a lowest index, the UE uses the same RS resource index q_{d} as for a PUCCH transmission with a spatial setting from the two spatial settings with lowest index in the PUCCH resource with the lowest index - else, if the UE is provided a spatial setting by PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo for a PUCCH resource with a lowest index for active UL BWP b of each carrier f and serving cell c , as described in clause 9.2.2, the UE uses the same RS resource index q_{d} as for a PUCCH transmission in the PUCCH resource with the lowest index - If the PUSCH transmission is not scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , and if the UE is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS and is not provided PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS and PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-r16, the UE uses the same RS resource index q_{d} as for an SRS resource set with an SRS resource associated with the PUSCH transmission - If\n---\nwhere - P_{\\text {CMAX }_{1} f, c}(i) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS38.101-3] for carrier f of primary cell c in PUCCH transmission occasion i - P_{0 \\_ \\text {PUCCH }, b, f, c}\\left(q_{u}\\right) is a parameter composed of the sum of a component P_{0 \\_N O M I N A L, P U C C H} , provided by p 0 -nominal, or P_{0 \\_N O M I N A L} PUCCH =0 \\mathrm{dBm} if p 0 -nominal is not provided, for carrier f of primary cell c and, if provided, a component P_{0 \\_ \\text {UE_PUCCH }}\\left(q_{u}\\right) provided by p0-PUCCH-Value in P0-PUCCH for active UL BWP b of carrier f of primary cell c , where 0 <= q_{u}<Q_{u}-Q_{u} is a size for a set of P_{O_{-} U E \\_P U C C H} values provided by maxNrofPUCCH P 0 -PerSet.

If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the p0-PUCCH-Value value through the link to a corresponding p 0-P U C C H-I d index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }, \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If the UE is provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321 ] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines p0-PUCCH-Value value according to the corresponding one or two sets of power control parameters.

HARQ-ACK information reporting is associated with a CORESET through a reception of a PDCCH with a DCI format triggering the reporting of the HARQ-ACK information by the UE. For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes P H assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively. If a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PUCCH-SCell. A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index 0 or of priority index 1 . For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 . If a UE is provided one PUCCH-Config - if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config If a UE is provided two PUCCH-Config\n---\nIn clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a number of respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360 ; otherwise, the UE determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective UCI bits as described in [5, TS 38.212]. 9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet in PUCCH-Config, a PUCCH resource set is provided by pucch-ResourceCommon through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} PRBs. For operation in FR2-2, pucch-ResourceCommon can also provide a number of N_{R B} RBs for the PUCCH resource set; otherwise N_{R B}=1 . The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }} , and a cyclic shift index set for a PUCCH transmission.\n---\n- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols, - the number of UCI bits is more than 2, - the PUCCH resource includes an orthogonal cover code and the UE is not provided uselnterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated A spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission by a UE is provided by - an indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIstate, if provided, as described in [6, TS 38.214]; - PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo if the UE is configured with a single value for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold; - as described in [11, TS 38.321], if the UE is provided multiple values for PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo. The UE applies corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] and a corresponding setting for a spatial domain filter to transmit PUCCH in the first slot that is after slot k+3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subfame }, \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information with ACK value corresponding to a PDSCH reception providing the PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, each slot consists of N_{\\text {symb }}^{\\text {slot }} symbols as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides ssb-Index, the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-Index for a same serving cell or, if servingCellld is provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld - else if PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides csi-RS-Index, or the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState provides csi-rs configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a CSI-RS with resource index provided by csi-RSIndex or csi-rs for a same serving cell or, if servingCellld or cell is provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld or cell - else PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides srs, the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a transmission of a SRS with resource index provided by resource for a same serving cell and/or active UL BWP or, if servingCellld and/or uplinkBWP are provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld and/or for an UL BWP indicated by uplinkBWP If a UE\n---\n- is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, and - is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212] a spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission from the UE is same as a spatial setting for PDCCH receptions by the UE in the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the PCell and, if the CORESET has two activated TCI states as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the spatial setting for the PUCCH transmission based on the first TCI state. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a same spatial setting applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple slots. A number of DMRS symbols for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is provided by additionalDMRS. Use of \\pi / 2 -BPSK, instead of QPSK, for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is indicated by pi2BPSK. 9.2.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK In this clause, for the purpose of determining a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission in a slot using a PUCCH resource indicator field in a DCI format that schedules a PDSCH reception, and for the purpose of determining the slot for the PUCCH transmission, a UE is assumed to generate HARQ-ACK information regardless of whether or not the ETSI\n---\nThe UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization, as described in clause 16.2.4, the UE does not receive PSFCH in any PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission in a resource provided by a DCI format 3-0 or, for a configured grant, in a resource provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission. The UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization as described in clause 16.2.4, the UE does not transmit a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format 3.0 or, for a configured grant, in any of the resources provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH that was not transmitted due to prioritization. The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a configured grant in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the configured grant. The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format 3 \\_0 and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the dynamic grant. For reporting HARQ-ACK information on uplink corresponding to one or multiple PSSCH transmissions with a corresponding SCI format with the field 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' set to disabled, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with the contents instructed by higher layer. The priority value of the HARQ-ACK information is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission. A UE does not expect to be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources to report HARQ-ACK information that start earlier than T_{\\text {prep }}=(N+1) \\cdot(2048+144) \\cdot \\kappa \\cdot 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{c} after the end of a last symbol of a last PSFCH reception occasion, from a number of PSFCH reception occasions that the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission, where - \\kappa and T_{c} are defined in [4, TS 38.211] - \\mu=\\min \\left(\\mu_{S L}, \\mu_{U L}\\right) , where \\mu_{S L} is the SCS configuration of the SLBWP and \\mu_{U L} is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP on the primary cell - N is determined from \\mu according to Table 16.5-1\n---\nProcedures for a RedCap UE are same as described for a UE in all other clauses of this document unless stated otherwise. In this clause, the term 'UE' refers to a RedCap UE. A UE expects the initial DL BWP and the active DL BWP after the UE (re)establishes dedicated RRC connection to be smaller than or equal to the maximum DL bandwidth that the UE supports. A UE can be provided a DL BWP by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, and an UL BWP by intitalUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. If mitialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonSIB indicates an UL BWP that is larger than a maximum UL BWP that a UE supports, the UE expects to be provided an UL BWP by intialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. A UE can be provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated a DL BWP, other than the initial DL BWP. A UE can be provided by BWP-UplinkDedicated an UL BWP, other than the initial UL BWP, that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL band width that the UE supports. If a UE is provided RACH-ConfigCommon-RedCap or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA-RedCap, the UE uses corresponding parameters to perform the procedures in clauses 8.1, 8.1A, and 8.3; otherwise, the UE uses corresponding parameters from RACH-ConfigCommon or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA. If a UE is provided initialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB and does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE transmits PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.1 using a PUCCH resource set provided by pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap, except that frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission is disabled if disable-FH-PUCCH is provided in PUCCH-ConfigCommonRedCap. If frequency hopping of the PUCCH transmission is disabled then, for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial cyclic shift indexes as r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} \\bmod N_{\\mathrm{CS}} and determines the PRB index as - R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }}+R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset-add }}+\\left\\lfloor r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\\mathrm{CS}}\\right\\rfloor , if BWP-part = 'FromLowerEdge' - \\quad N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\mathrm{size}}-R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }}-R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset-add }}-1-\\left\\lfloor r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\\mathrm{CS}}\\right\\rfloor , otherwise",
