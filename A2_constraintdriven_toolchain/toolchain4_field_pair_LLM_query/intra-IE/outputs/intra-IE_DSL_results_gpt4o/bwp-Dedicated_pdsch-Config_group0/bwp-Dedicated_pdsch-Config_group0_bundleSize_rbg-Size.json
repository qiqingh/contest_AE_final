When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'staticBundling', the P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} value is configured with the single value indicated by the higher layer parameter bundleSize. When a UE is configured with nominal RBG size P=2 for bandwidth part i according to Clause 5.1.2.2.1, or when a UE is configured with interleaving unit of 2 for VRB to PRB mapping provided by the higher layer parameter vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config for band width part i , the UE is not expected to be configured with P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime}= 4. For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'fdmScheme A' or 'fdmSchemeB', and when the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)',",
