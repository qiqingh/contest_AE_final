If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneousTCI-UpdateListl or simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneousTCI-UpdateListl or simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2, respectively; - CORESET ID: This field indicates a Control Resource Set identified with ControlResourceSetld as specified in TS 38.331 [5], for which the TCI State is being indicated. In case the value of the field is 0 , the field refers to the Control Resource Set configured by controlResourceSetZero as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 4 bits; - TCI State ID: This field indicates the TCI state identified by TCI-Stateld as specified in TS 38.331 [5] applicable to the Control Resource Set identified by CORESET ID field. If the field of CORESET ID is set to 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld for a TCI state of the first 64 TCI-states configured by tci-StatesToAddModList and tciStatesToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or by dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToAddModList and dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or the reference BWP. If the field of CORESET ID is set to the other value than 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld configured by tci-StatesPDCCHToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID.
