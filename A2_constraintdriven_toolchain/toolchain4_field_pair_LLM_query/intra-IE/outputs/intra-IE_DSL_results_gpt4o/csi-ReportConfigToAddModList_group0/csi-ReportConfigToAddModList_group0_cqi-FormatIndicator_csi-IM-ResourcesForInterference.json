A CSI Reporting Setting with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, can be configured with wideband frequency-granularity only if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X=0 , as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2.
