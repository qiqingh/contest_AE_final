    "evidence": "If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', - the UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and pmi-FormatIndicator set to 'widebandPMI' and, - the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication ( i_{1} in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band. The CQ[ is calculated conditioned on the reported i_{1} assuming PDSCH transmission with N_{p} >= 1 precoders (corresponding to the same i_{1} but different i_{2} in Clause 5.2.2.2.1), where the UE assumes that one precoder is randomly selected from the set of N_{p} precoders for each PRG on PDSCH, where the PRG size for CQI calculation is configured by the higher layer parameter pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-CQI', - if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, r ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank r and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \\ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \\ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} of port indices, where p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank v and R \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, P\\} where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks. - if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication, the UE assumes, for each CSIRS resource in the CSI resource setting linked to the CSI-ReportConfig, that the CSI-RS port indices p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)}=\\{0, \\ldots, v-1\\} are associated with ranks v=1,2, \\ldots, P where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. - When calculating the CQI for a rank, the UE shall use the ports indicated for that rank for the selected CSI-RS resource. The precoder for the indicated ports shall be assumed to be the identity matrix scaled by \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v}} . If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive filters.",
