Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs.

For semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s): - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'.

If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- the CSI parameters without averaging two or more instances of any periodic or semi-persistent n z p -CSI-RSResources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement or for interference measurement located in different DL transmissions, - the instances of the n z p -CSI-RS-Resources are not in the same channel occupancy duration indicated by DCI format 2 0, if the UE is provided at least one of SlotFormatIndicator or co-DurationList; or occupied by PDSCH(s) and/or aperiodic CSI-RS(s) indicated by DCI formats, if any, and the corresponding PDCCH(s), if the UE is neither provided with CO-DurationPerCell nor SlotFormatIndicator, but is provided with csi-RS-ValidationWith-DCI - the interference measurements for computing CSI value based on periodic/semi-persistent CSI-IM measured only in OFDM symbol(s) that fulfill the same conditions under which the UE is expected to receive periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS as described in Clause 11.1 and Clause 11.1.1 of [6, TS 38.213].

The total number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more than 128. For L1-RSRP reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-RSRP value is defined by a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-RSRP is quantized to a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, and the differential L 1 -RSRP is quantized to ETSI\n---\n5.2.1.4.4 L1-SINR Reporting For L1-SINR computation, for channel measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH Block resources, for interference measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resources. - for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64 CSI -RS resources or up to 64 \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} Block resources.

The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset.

When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset. When one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'notConfigured', the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the SSB or NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI reference resource, (defined in TS 38.211 [4]) associated with the CSI resource setting. - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'configured', the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion of SSB or NZP CSI-RS (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) associated with the CSI resource setting. - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'notConfigured', the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the CSI-IM or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) or NZP CSI-RS for channel and interference measurement no later than the CSI reference resource associated with the CSI resource setting.
