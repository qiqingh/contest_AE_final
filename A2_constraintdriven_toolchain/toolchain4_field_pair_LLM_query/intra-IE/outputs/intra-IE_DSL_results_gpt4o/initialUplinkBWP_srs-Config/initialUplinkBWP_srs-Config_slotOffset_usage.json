For non-codebook based transmission, the UE can be scheduled with DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 when at least one SRS resource is configured in SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'nonCodebook'. 6.1.2 Resource allocation 6.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain When the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and no CSI report by a DCI or by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, or the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and a CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a DCI, the 'Time domain resource assignment' field value m of the DCI or the PUSCH time resource allocation field value m of the RAR UL grant or of the fallbackRAR UL grant provides a row index m+1 to an allocated table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset K_{2} , the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol S and the allocation length L , the PUSCH mapping type, the number of slots used for TBS determination (if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present in the resource allocation table), and the number of repetitions (if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission. ETSI\n---\nFor a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'aperiodic': - the UE receives a configuration of SRS resource sets, - the UE receives a downlink DCI, a group common DCI, or an uplink DCI based command where a codepoint of the DCI may trigger one or more SRS resource set(s). For SRS in a resource set with usage set to 'codebook' or 'antennaSwitching', the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is N_{2} symbols and an additional time duration T_{\\text {switch- }} Otherwise, the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is N_{2}+14 symbols and an additional time duration T_{\\text {switch }} .

Each DL PRS resource is configured via higher layer parameters N R -DL-PRS-Resource and is uniquely defined by n r-D L- PRS-ResourcelD.

The UE only expects to be configured with dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap if dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor is configured with value greater than 1.
