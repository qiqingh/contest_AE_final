Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Typel for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type 2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread\\} - 'typeB': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\} - 'typeC': \\{Doppler shift, average delay\\} - 'typeD': \\{Spatial Rx parameter\\} The UE can be configured with a list of up to 128 DLorJointTCIState configurations, within the higher layer parameter PDSCH-Config for providing a reference signal for the quasi co-location for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH in a CC, for CSI-RS, and to provide a reference, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS.
