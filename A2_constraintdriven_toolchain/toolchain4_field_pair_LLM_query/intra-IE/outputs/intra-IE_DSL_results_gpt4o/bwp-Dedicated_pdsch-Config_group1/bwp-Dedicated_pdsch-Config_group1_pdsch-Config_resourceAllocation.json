When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or PDSCHs with SPS, the REs corresponding to the configured or dynamically indicated resources in Clauses 5.1.4.1, 5.1.4.2 are not available for PDSCH. Furthermore, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources, and the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted. A UE is not expected to handle the case where PDSCH DM-RS REs are overlapping, even partially, with any RE(s) not available for PDSCH. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst represents all of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks corresponding to SS/PBCH block indices provided by ssbPositionsInBurst as described in Clause 4.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. 5.1.4.1 PDSCH resource mapping with RB symbol level granularity The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternGrouplDCI-1-2, rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 instead of rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup2. The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\ldots 0 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4_1, and the procedures for PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4 _ 2 by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternToAddModList, rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup 2 configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast. A UE may be configured with any of the following higher layer parameters indicating REs declared as not available for PDSCH:",
