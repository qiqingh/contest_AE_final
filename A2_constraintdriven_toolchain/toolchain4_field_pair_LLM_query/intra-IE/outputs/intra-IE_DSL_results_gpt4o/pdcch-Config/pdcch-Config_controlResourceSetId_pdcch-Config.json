A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe. - If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH: - if the UE is configured with crs-RateMatch-PerCoresetPoollndex, REs indicated by the CRS pattern(s) in Ite-CRS-PatternList 1-r16 if the PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 0 ', or the CRS pattern(s) in lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16 if PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 1 '; - otherwise, REs indicated by lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16 and lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16, in ServingCellConfig-\n---\nIf a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is receiving a DCI carrying the TCI-State indication and without DL assignment, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 by the DCI is more than one. If the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI] and with PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE receives an activation command for CORESET associated with each coresetPoollndex, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in one CC/DL BWP. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When a UE supports two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' the UE may receive an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.24 of [10, TS 38.321], the activation command is used to map up to 8 combinations of one or two TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'. The UE is not expected to receive more than 8 TCI states in the activation command.\n---\n- For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi co-location type(s), as described in clause 5.1.5, through higher layer signaling of qcl-info which contains a list of references to TCIState's for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the CSI triggering state. If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. - If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], when the reported value is one of the values of \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, or is smaller than 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16, enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameter repetition, or is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on'. - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet - if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.

The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}{ }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} when the reported value of beamSwitchTiming-r16 is one of the values \\{224,336\\} \\cdot 2^{\\text {max }\\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS. If there is a PDSCH indicated with two TCI states in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the first TCI state of the two TCI states when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.\n---\nETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = common for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-SRS-RNTI, or CI-RNTI and, only for the primary cell, C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), or PS-RNTI, or - SearchSpace-Multicast in PDCCH-Config-Multicast for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI, or G-CS-RNTI, or - searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH on secondary cell for a DCI format 4 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, and - a USS set configured by - SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, or SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI, or - sdt-CG-SearchSpace for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI as described in clause 19.1.

For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,1 \\_2 , when a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and sfnSchemePdsch is not configured, and there is no TCI codepoint with two TCI states in the activation command, and if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal or larger than the threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable and the CORESET which schedules the PDSCH is indicated with two TCI states, the UE assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the first TCI state or QCL assumption which is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell. If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) , and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) . When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL. Independent of the configuration of tci-PresentInDCI and tci-PresentDCI-1-2 in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL and at least one configured TCI state for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains qci-Type set to 'typeD', - the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the qcl-Type is set to 'typeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers). - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets, - the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH associated with a value of coresetPoolIndex of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi\n---\nFor PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,1 \\_2 , when a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and sfnSchemePdsch is not configured, and there is no TCI codepoint with two TCI states in the activation command, and if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal or larger than the threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable and the CORESET which schedules the PDSCH is indicated with two TCI states, the UE assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the first TCI state or QCL assumption which is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell. If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) , and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) . When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL. Independent of the configuration of tci-PresentInDCI and tci-PresentDCI-1-2 in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL and at least one configured TCI state for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains qci-Type set to 'typeD', - the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE.
