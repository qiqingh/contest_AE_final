For a transmission occasion of multiple CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by multi-CSI-PUCCHResourceList.

A UE is configured by maxCodeRate a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR, and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4. If a UE transmits CSI reports using PUCCH format 2, the UE transmits only wideband CSI for each CSI report [6, TS 38.214]. In the following, a Part 1 CSI report refers either to a CSI report with only wideband CSI or to a Part 1 CSI report with wideband CSI and sub-band CSI.",
