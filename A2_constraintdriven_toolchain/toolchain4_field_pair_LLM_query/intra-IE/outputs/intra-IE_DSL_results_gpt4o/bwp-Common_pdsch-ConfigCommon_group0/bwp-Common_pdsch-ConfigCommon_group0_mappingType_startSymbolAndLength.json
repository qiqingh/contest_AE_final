A set of allowed periodicities P are defined in [12, TS 38.331]. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofSlots, provides the number of consecutive slots allocated within a configured grant period. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofPUSCHInSlot provides the number of consecutive PUSCH allocations within a slot, where the first PUSCH allocation follows the higher layer parameter timeDomainAllocation for Type 1 PUSCH transmission or the higher layer configuration according to [10, TS 38.321], and UL grant received on the DCI for Type 2 PUSCH transmissions, and the remaining PUSCH allocations have the same length and PUSCH mapping type, and are appended following the previous allocations without any gaps. The same combination of start symbol and length and PUSCH mapping type repeats over the consecutively allocated slots. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, and when the higher layer parameter ueSemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is not configured, where a UE is performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM symbols on all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension T_{\\text {ext }} to be applied for transmission according to [4, TS 38.211] where the index for \\Delta_{i} [4, TS 38.211] is chosen randomly from a set of values configured by higher layers according to the following rule:\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation Indicates a combination of start symbol and length and PUSCH mapping type from the TDRA table (PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList if provided in PUSCHConfigCommon, or else the default Table 6.1.2.1.1-2 in 38.214 [19] is used if pusch-TimeDomainAllocationList is not provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon). The parameter K2 in the table is not used for msgA PUSCH. The network configures one of msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation and startSymbolAndLengthMisgA-PO, but not both.
