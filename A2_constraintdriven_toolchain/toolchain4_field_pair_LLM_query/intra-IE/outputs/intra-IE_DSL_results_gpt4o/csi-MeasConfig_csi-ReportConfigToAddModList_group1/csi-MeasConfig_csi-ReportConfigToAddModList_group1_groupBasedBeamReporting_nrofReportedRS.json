The total number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more than 128. For L1-RSRP reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-RSRP value is defined by a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-RSRP is quantized to a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, and the differential L 1 -RSRP is quantized to ETSI\n---\n- for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64 CSI -RS resources or up to 64 \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} Block resources. For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value is defined by a 7-bit value in the range [-23,40] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', the UE shall use differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range [ -23,40 ] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a 4 -bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset.
