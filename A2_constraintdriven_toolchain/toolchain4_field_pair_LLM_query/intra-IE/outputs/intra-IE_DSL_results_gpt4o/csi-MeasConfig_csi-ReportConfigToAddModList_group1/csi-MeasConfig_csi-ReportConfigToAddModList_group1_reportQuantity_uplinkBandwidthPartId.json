A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig for periodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info. A UE does not expect to be configured with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured both with trs-Info and repetition. Each CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], is configured by the higher layer parameter N Z P -CSI-RS-Resource with the following restrictions: - the time-domain locations of the two CSI-RS resources in a slot, or of the four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots (which are the same across two consecutive slots), as defined by higher layer parameter CSI-RS-resourceMapping, is given by one of - l \\in\\{4,8\\}, l \\in\\{5,9\\} , or l \\in\\{6,10\\} for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 , - l \\in\\{0,4\\}, l \\in\\{1,5\\}, l \\in\\{2,6\\}, l \\in\\{3,7\\}, l \\in\\{7,11\\}, l \\in\\{8,12\\} or l \\in\\{9,13\\} for frequency range 2 . - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211] and higher layer parameter density configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping. - if carrier N_{\\mathrm{grid}}^{\\mathrm{size}, \\mu}=52, N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}}=52, \\mu=0 and the carrier is configured in paired spectrum, the band width of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freq Band configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is X resource blocks, where X >= 28 resources if the UE indicates trs-AddB W-Set I for the trs-AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 1] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation and X >= 32 if the UE indicates t r s -AddBW-Set2 for the AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 2] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation; in these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising \\mathrm{X}<52 resource blocks, the UE does not expect that the total number of PRBs allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4 , where all CSI-RS resource configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freqBand configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is the minimum of 52 and \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}} resource blocks, or is equal to \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} resource blocks.
