    "evidence": "Each CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S >= 1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior. The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement: - CSI-[Mresource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.4. - NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1. - NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1. The UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for channel measurement and the CSI-[M resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'. When NZP CSI-RS resource(s) is used for interference measurement, the UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and the CSI- [M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are QCLed with respect to 'typeD'. For L1-SINR measurement: - When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement on SSB or NZP CSI-RS and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-/M-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter n z p-C S I-R S ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M or on 1 port NZP CSI-RS with density 3 REs/RB, where each SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is associated with one CSI-[M resource or one NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement by the ordering of the SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and CSI-[M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement in the corresponding resource sets. The number of SSB(s) or CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[Mresources or the number of NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement. - UE may apply the SSB, or 'typeD' RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' to the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, as the reference RS for determining 'typeD' assumption for the corresponding CSI[M resource or the corresponding NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting.\n---\n- density in resourceMapping defines CSI-RS frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB, and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density value of 1 / 2 , where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4 - 1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid. - cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} csi-SSB-ResourceSet, csi-SSB-ResourceSet2 CSI-SSB-ResourceSet for channel measurements.
