    "evidence": "ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) The UE may be configured with a DCI field for triggering the aperiodic ZP CSI-RS. A list of ZP-CSI-RSResourceSet(s), provided by higher layer parameter aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList in PDSCHConfig, is configured for aperiodic triggering. The maximum number of aperiodic ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) configured per BWP is 3 . The bit-length of DCI field ZP CSI-RS trigger depends on the number of aperiodic ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)configured (up to 2 bits). Each non-zero codepoint of 'ZP CSI-RS' trigger in DCI format 1 _1 triggers one aperiodic 'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet' in the list aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList by indicating the aperiodic ZP CSI-RS resource set ID. The DCI codepoint '01' triggers the resource set with 'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId' set to ' 1 ', the DCI codepoint ' 10 ' triggers the resource set with 'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId' set to ' 2 ', and the DCI codepoint '11' triggers the resource set with 'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId' set to ' 3 '. Codepoint ' 00 ' is reserved for not triggering aperiodic ZP CSI-RS. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by DCI format 1_0, the REs corresponding to configured resources in aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList or in aperiodicZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModListDCI-1-2 are available for PDSCH. When the UE is configured with multi-slot and single-slot PDSCH scheduling, the triggered aperiodic ZP CSI-RS is applied to all the slot(s) of the PDSCH scheduled or the PDSCHs with SPS activated by the PDCCH containing the trigger. For a UE configured with a list of semi-persistent ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) provided by higher layer parameter sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList: - when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.19 of [10, TS 38.321], for ZP CSI-RS resource(s), the corresponding action in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumption on the PDSCH RE mapping corresponding to the activated ZP CSI-RS resource(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+ 3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }, \\mu}+\\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K \\text { mac }}}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{\\text {mac }} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\text {mac }} is provided by K-M a c or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K -Mac is not provided. - when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.19 of [10, TS 38.321], for activated ZP CSI-RS resource(s), the corresponding action in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumption on cessation of the PDSCH RE mapping corresponding to the de-activated ZP CSI-RS resource(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe } e^{\\mu}}+\\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K \\text { mac }}}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{\\text {mac }} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\text {mac }} is provided by K Mac or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K -Mac is not provided. 5.1.5 Antenna ports quasi co-location The UE can be configured with a list of up to M TCI-State configurations within the higher layer parameter PDSCHConfig to decode PDSCH according to a detected PDCCH with DCI intended for the UE and the given serving cell, where M depends on the UE capability maxNumberConfiguredTCIstatesPerCC. Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Typel for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type 2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread\\} - 'typeB': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\}",
