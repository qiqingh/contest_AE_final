    "evidence": "Each Reporting Setting CSI-ReportConfig is associated with a single downlink BWP (indicated by higher layer parameter BWP-Id) given in the associated CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement and contains the parameter(s) for one CSI reporting band: codebook configuration including codebook subset restriction, time-domain behavior, frequency granularity for CQI and PMI, measurement restriction configurations, and the CSI-related quantities to be reported by the UE such as the layer indicator (LI), L1-RSRP, L1-SINR, CRI, and SSBRI (SSB Resource Indicator) and Capability[Set]Index. The time domain behavior of the CSI-ReportConfig is indicated by the higher layer parameter reportConfigType and can be set to 'aperiodic', 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH', 'semiPersistentOnPUSCH', or 'periodic'. For 'periodic' and 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH/'semiPersistentOnPUSCH' CSI reporting, the configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The higher layer parameter reportQuantity indicates the CSI-related, L1-RSRP-related, L1-SINR-related or Capability[Set][ndex-related quantities to report. The reportFreqConfiguration indicates the reporting granularity in the frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI reporting is wideband or sub-band. The timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements parameter in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel measurements and timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements can be configured to enable time domain restriction for interference measurements. The CSI-ReportConfig can also contain CodebookConfig, which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II, Enhanced Type II CSI, or Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection including codebook subset restriction when applicable, and configurations of group-based reporting. ETSI\n---\nWhen one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'notConfigured', the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the SSB or NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI reference resource, (defined in TS 38.211 [4]) associated with the CSI resource setting. - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'configured', the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion of SSB or NZP CSI-RS (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) associated with the CSI resource setting. - If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to 'notConfigured', the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on only the CSI-IM or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in [4, TS 38.211]) or NZP CSI-RS for channel and interference measurement no later than the CSI reference resource associated with the CSI resource setting.
