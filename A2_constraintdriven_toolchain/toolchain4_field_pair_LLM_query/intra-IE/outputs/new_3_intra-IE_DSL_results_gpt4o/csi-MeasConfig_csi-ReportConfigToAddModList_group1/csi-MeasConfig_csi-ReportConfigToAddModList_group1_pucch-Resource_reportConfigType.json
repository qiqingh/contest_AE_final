    "evidence": "For semi-persistent reporting on PUSCH, a set of trigger states are higher layer configured by CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList, where the CSI request field in DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activates one of the trigger states. A UE is not expected to receive a DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activating one semipersistent CSI report with the same CSI-ReportConfigId as in semi-persistent CSI report which is activated by a previously received DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI. For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }}, \\mu where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. For a UE configured with CSI resource setting(s) where the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'semiPersistent'.",
