When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], a CSI-SSB-ResourceSet configured for L1-RSRP reporting includes one or more sets of SSB indices where PCI indices are associated with the sets of SSB indices, respectively. When the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to ' cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' an index of UE capability value set, indicating the maximum supported number of SRS antenna ports, is reported along with the pair of SSBRI/CRI and L1-RSRP. 5.2.1.4.4 L1-SINR Reporting For L1-SINR computation, for channel measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH Block resources, for interference measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resources. - for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64 CSI -RS resources or up to 64 \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} Block resources. For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value is defined by a 7-bit value in the range [-23,40] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', the UE shall use differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range [ -23,40 ] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a 4 -bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset.
