When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1.\n---\n- an association between the search space set s and a CORESET p by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610 - a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of k_{s} slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of o_{s} slots, by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset or by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 - a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the CORESET for PDCCH monitoring within each slot where the UE monitors PDCCH, by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot - a duration of T_{s}<k_{s} indicating a number of slots that the search space set s exists by duration, or a number of slots in consecutive groups of slots where the search space set s can exist by duration-r 17 - a bitmap, by monitoringSlots WithinSlotGroup, that applies per group of slots and provides a PDCCH monitoring pattern indicating slots in a group of slots for PDCCH monitoring - a size of the group of slots is same as a size of monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup\n---\nduration Number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The UE ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity- 1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). For IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 and DCI format 2 \\_5 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). freqMonitorLocations Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set. monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 \\_0 , only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8' and 'sl10' are applicable. For IAB-MT, If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sI1', 'sI2' or 'sI4' are applicable. If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2 \\_0 or DCI format 2_5, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213, clause 10). If monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 is present, any previously configured monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset is released, and if monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset is present, any previously configured monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 is released. monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup Indicates which slot(s) within a slot group are configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring. The first (leftmost, most significant) bit represents the first slot in the slot group, the second bit represents the second slot in the slot group, and so on. A bit set to '1' indicates that the corresponding slot is configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring (see TS 38.213, clause 10). monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot The first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT. For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 1 symbol.\n---\nthe duration of periodicityAndPattern in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1.\n---\n- a bitmap by freqMonitorLocations, if provided, to indicate an index of one or more RB sets for the search space set s , where the MSB k in the bitmap corresponds to RB set k-1 in the DL BWP. For RB set k indicated in the bitmap, the first \\operatorname{PRB} of the frequency domain monitoring location confined within the RB set is given by R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu}+N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} , where R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu} is the index of first common RB of the RB set k [6, TS 38.214], and N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} is provided by r b -Offset or N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }}=0 if r b -Offset is not provided. For each RB set with a corresponding value of 1 in the bitmap, the frequency domain resource allocation pattern for the monitoring location is determined based on the first N_{\\text {RBG }}^{\\text {size }} 0 bits infrequencyDomainResources provided by the associated CORESET configuration. If the monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot indicates to a UE to monitor PDCCH in a subset of up to three consecutive symbols that are same in every slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for all search space sets, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PDCCH SCS other than 15 kHz if the subset includes at least one symbol after the third symbol. A UE does not expect to be provided a first symbol and a number of consecutive symbols for a CORESET that results to a PDCCH candidate mapping to symbols of different slots. A UE does not expect any two PDCCH monitoring occasions on an active DL BWP, for a same search space set or for different search space sets, in a same CORESET to be separated by a non-zero number of symbols that is smaller than the CORESET duration. A UE determines a PDCCH monitoring occasion on an active DL BWP from the PDCCH monitoring periodicity, the PDCCH monitoring offset, and the PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot. For search space set s , the UE determines that PDCCH monitoring occasions exist in a slot with number n_{s, f}^{\\mu}\\left[4\\right. , TS 38.211] in a frame with number n_{f} if ( n_{f} \\left.N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{, f}}^{\\mu}-o_{s}\\right) \\bmod k_{s}=0 . If monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup is provided, the slot is the first slot in a group of slots and PDCCH monitoring occasions exist in the group of slots. The UE monitors PDCCH candidates for search space set s for T_{s} consecutive slots, starting from slot n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu} , and does not monitor PDCCH candidates for search space set s for the next k_{s}-T_{s} consecutive slots.\n---\nfor a USS, M_{s_{1} \\max }^{(L)} is the maximum of M_{s_{1} n_{C I}}^{(L)} over all configured n_{C I} values for a CCE aggregation level L of search space set s ; the RNTI value used for n_{\\text {RNTI }} is the C-RNTI. For search space sets s_{i} and s_{j} that include searchSpaceLinking with value s_{j} and s_{i} , respectively, a UE monitors, in monitoring occasions with same index according to each of search space sets s_{i} and s_{j} in a slot, PDCCH candidates m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} and m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} , with m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} , for detection of a DCI format with same information. The UE expects k_{s_{i}}= k_{s_{j}}, o_{s_{i}}=o_{s_{j}}, T_{s_{i}}=T_{s_{j}}, M_{s_{i}}^{(L)}=M_{s_{j}}^{(L)} , and a same number of non-overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions per slot based on corresponding monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot, for search space sets s_{i} and s_{j} . For CORESET p_{i} associated with the search space set s_{i} and for CORESET p_{j} associated with the search space set s_{j} , the UE is provided tci- PresentInDCI or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 for either none or both of CORESETs p_{i} and p_{j} . For CORESET p_{i} associated with the search space set s_{i} and for CORESET p_{j} associated with the search space set s_{j} , the UE is either not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any of the two CORESETs, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for both CORESETs. A UE can indicate by countLinkedCandidates a capability for counting PDCCH candidates m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} and m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} either as 2 PDCCH candidates or as 3 PDCCH candidates. For search space sets s_{i}, s_{j}, s_{k} , and s_{l} , that include searchSpaceLinking with values s_{j}, s_{i}, s_{l} , and s_{k} , respectively, a UE expects to simultaneously monitor PDCCH candidates m_{s_{i}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} , and m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)}=m_{s_{l}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} only if a first CCE of m_{s_{i} n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} or m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} has different index than a first CCE of m_{s_{k} n}^{(16)}{ }_{C I, 2} or m_{s_{l} n n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} in a CORESET configured with c c e -REG-MappingType = 'nonInterleaved' and with duration of one symbol. If a UE\n---\nmonitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup Indicates which slot(s) within a slot group are configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring. The first (leftmost, most significant) bit represents the first slot in the slot group, the second bit represents the second slot in the slot group, and so on. A bit set to '1' indicates that the corresponding slot is configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring (see TS 38.213, clause 10). monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot The first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT. For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 1 symbol.
