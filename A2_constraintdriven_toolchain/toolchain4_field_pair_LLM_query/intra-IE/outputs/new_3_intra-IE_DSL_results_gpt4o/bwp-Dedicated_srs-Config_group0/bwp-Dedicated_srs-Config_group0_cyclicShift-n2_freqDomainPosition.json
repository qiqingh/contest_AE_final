If not configured, then start RB hopping is not enabled and k_{\\text {hoppng }} is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. - Defining frequency domain position and configurable shift, as defined by the higher layer parameters freqDomainPosition and freqDomainShift, respectively, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If freqDomainPosition is not configured, freqDomainPosition is zero. - Cyclic shift, as defined by the higher layer parameter cyclicShift-n2, cyclicShift-n4, or cyclicShift-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4 or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb value, as defined by the higher layer parameter transmission Comb described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Transmission comb offset, as defined by the higher layer parameter combOffset-n2, combOffset-n4, and combOffset-n8 for transmission comb value 2, 4, or 8, and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211].",
