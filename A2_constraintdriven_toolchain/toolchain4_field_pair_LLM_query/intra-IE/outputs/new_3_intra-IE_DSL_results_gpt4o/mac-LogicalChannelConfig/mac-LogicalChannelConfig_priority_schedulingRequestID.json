    "evidence": "A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 . A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0 . The UE is also configured a periodicity S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} in symbols or slots and an offset S R_{\\text {OFFSET }} in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu}[4 , TS 38.211] in a frame with number n_{f} if \\left(n_{f} \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\\mu}-S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 .\n---\n- if the second PUCCH has priority index 1 , - if sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC is provided - the UE transmits the first PUCCH if a smallest priority value of the first PUCCH is smaller than s l -PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC; otherwise, the UE transmits the second PUCCH - else - the UE transmits the second PUCCH - else - the UE transmits the first PUCCH if the smallest priority value of the first PUCCH is smaller than slPriorityThreshold; otherwise, the UE transmits the second PUCCH When the UE determines to transmit the second PUCCH, the UE determines a single resource for multiplexing UCI in the second PUCCH as described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2. 9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH In the following, a UE is configured to transmit K PUCCHs for respective K SRs in a slot, as determined by a set of schedulingRequestResourceld, a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, and a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell, with SR transmission occasions that would overlap with a transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information from the UE in the slot or with a transmission of a PUCCH with CSI report(s) from the UE in the slot. If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.3.
