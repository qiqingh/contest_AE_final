RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical channel per MAC entity: - priority where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level; - prioritisedBitRate which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR); - bucketSizeDuration which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD). RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping restrictions for each logical channel:\n---\nNOTE: Sidelink data for discovery and sidelink data for non-discovery transmitted by a UE cannot be multiplexed into the same TB because they are always associated with different destination L2 IDs (see TS 23.304 [26]). 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization 5.22.1.4.1.1 General The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed. RRC controls the scheduling of sidelink data by signalling for each logical channel: - sl-Priority where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level; - sl-PrioritisedBitRate which sets the sidelink Prioritized Bit Rate (SPBR); - sl-BucketSizeDuration which sets the sidelink Bucket Size Duration (sBSD).

If the field is not present, SL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be mapped to any configured grant configurations.
