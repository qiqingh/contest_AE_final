The UE identifies a RS resource index q_{d} in the set of RS resource indexes to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUSCHPathlossReferenceRS - If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a RAR UL grant as described in clause 8.3, or for a PUSCH transmission for Type-2 random access procedure as described in clause 8.1A, the UE uses the same RS resource index q_{d} as for a corresponding PRACH transmission",
