    "evidence": "ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to other than 'none' for aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info. A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig for periodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info. A UE does not expect to be configured with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured both with trs-Info and repetition. Each CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], is configured by the higher layer parameter N Z P -CSI-RS-Resource with the following restrictions: - the time-domain locations of the two CSI-RS resources in a slot, or of the four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots (which are the same across two consecutive slots), as defined by higher layer parameter CSI-RS-resourceMapping, is given by one of - l \\in\\{4,8\\}, l \\in\\{5,9\\} , or l \\in\\{6,10\\} for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 , - l \\in\\{0,4\\}, l \\in\\{1,5\\}, l \\in\\{2,6\\}, l \\in\\{3,7\\}, l \\in\\{7,11\\}, l \\in\\{8,12\\} or l \\in\\{9,13\\} for frequency range 2 . - a single port CSI-RS resource with density \\rho=3 given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211] and higher layer parameter density configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping. - if carrier N_{\\mathrm{grid}}^{\\mathrm{size}, \\mu}=52, N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}}=52, \\mu=0 and the carrier is configured in paired spectrum, the band width of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freq Band configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is X resource blocks, where X >= 28 resources if the UE indicates trs-AddB W-Set I for the trs-AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 1] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation and X >= 32 if the UE indicates t r s -AddBW-Set2 for the AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 2] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation; in these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising \\mathrm{X}<52 resource blocks, the UE does not expect that the total number of PRBs allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4 , where all CSI-RS resource configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freqBand configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is the minimum of 52 and \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}} resource blocks, or is equal to \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} resource blocks. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, freqBand configured by CSI-RSResourceMapping, is the minimum of 48 and \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} resource blocks, or is equal to \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}} sizesource blocks. - the UE is not expected to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the periodicity and slot offset for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, as given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211].\n---\n- powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'.\n---\nIf there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot n^{\\prime} . After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI to report CSI with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to quantities other than 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP- Capability[Set]Index', and 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index ' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report CSI during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in Clause 5-2-1.4 if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitPeriodicL 1 -RSRP to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP- Capability[Set]Index', or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report L1-RSRP during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in clause 5-2.1-4 and when reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP' or 'cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.",
