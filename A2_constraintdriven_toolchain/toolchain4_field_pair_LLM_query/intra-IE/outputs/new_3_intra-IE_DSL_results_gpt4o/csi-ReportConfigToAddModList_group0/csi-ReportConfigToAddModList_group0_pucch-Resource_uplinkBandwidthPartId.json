Supporting Type II CSI reporting on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 is a UE capability type2-SP-CSI-Feedback-LongPUCCH. A Type II CSI report (Part 1 only) carried on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 shall be calculated independently of any Type II CSI reports carried on the PUSCH (see Clause 5.2.3). When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP. If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended.",
