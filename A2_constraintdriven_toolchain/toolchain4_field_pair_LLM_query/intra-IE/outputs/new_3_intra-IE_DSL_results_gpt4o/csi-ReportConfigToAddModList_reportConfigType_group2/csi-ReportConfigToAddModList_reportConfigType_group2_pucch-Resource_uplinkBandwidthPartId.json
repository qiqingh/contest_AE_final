    "evidence": "For semi-persistent reporting on PUSCH, a set of trigger states are higher layer configured by CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList, where the CSI request field in DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activates one of the trigger states. A UE is not expected to receive a DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activating one semipersistent CSI report with the same CSI-ReportConfigId as in semi-persistent CSI report which is activated by a previously received DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI. For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }}, \\mu where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

If a TCI-State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS can be an SS/PBCH block, periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS located in same or different CC/DL BWP. - when a UE receives a deactivation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.12 of [10, TS 38.321], for activated CSI-RS/CSI-[M resource set(s) associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and UE assumption on cessation of CS[-RS/CSI-[M transmission corresponding to the deactivated CSI-RS/CSI-[M resource set(s) shall apply starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }{ }^{\\mu}}+\\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu} K_{\\text {mac }}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{m a c}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{m a c} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\mathrm{mac}} is provided by K-M a c or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K-M a c is not provided.\n---\nA semi-persistent report carried on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 supports Type II CSI feedback, but only Part 1 of Type II CSI feedback (See Clause 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). Supporting Type II CSI reporting on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 is a UE capability type2-SP-CSI-Feedback-LongPUCCH. A Type II CSI report (Part 1 only) carried on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 shall be calculated independently of any Type II CSI reports carried on the PUSCH (see Clause 5.2.3). When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP. If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended.\n---\n6.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical uplink shared channel PUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell. The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\n2> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant. 1> else if this uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI =1 or C-RNTI: 2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and 2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant: 3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant; 3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);\n---\nThe Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission. The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured. Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or a DSR (clause 5.4.9) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request (clause 5.25 ) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8).\n---\nETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08) 2> if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or, in current symbol n , if all multicast DRXes corresponding to the DRX group would not be in Active Time considering multicast assignments/DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions corresponding to the DRX group are configured with multicast DRX: 3> not transmit periodic SRS and semi-persistent SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7] in this DRX group; 3> not report CSI on PUCCH and semi-persistent CSI configured on PUSCH in this DRX group. 2> if CSI masking ( c s i-M a s k ) is setup by upper layers: 3> in current symbol n , if drx-onDurationTimer of a DRX group would not be running considering grants/assignments scheduled on Serving Cell(s) in this DRX group and DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in this clause; and 3> if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or, in current symbol n, if drxonDurationTimerPTM(s) of all multicast DRXes corresponding to the DRX group would not be running considering DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions corresponding to the DRX group are configured with multicast DRX: 4> not report CSI on PUCCH in this DRX group. NOTE 4: If a UE multiplexes a CSI configured on PUCCH with other overlapping UCI(s) according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] clause 9.2.5 and this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s) would be reported on a PUCCH resource either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured or outside the on-duration period of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other \\mathrm{UCl}(\\mathrm{s}) . The MAC entity shall ensure no rounding error is generated when performing the modulus operation with d r x NonIntegerShortCycle or drx-NonIntegerLongCycle as the divisor.\n---\n5.22.1.5 Scheduling Request In addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or SLDRX Command indication. The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR.\n---\nThe PUCCH spatial relation Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1.
