For a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i , the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol i , the UE can be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol i .\n---\nFor PUSCH repetition Type B, when a UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the CSI report(s) is multiplexed only on the first actual repetition. The UE does not expect that the first actual repetition has a single symbol duration. If pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH in pusch-Config contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous PUSCHs, K_{2} indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and mapping type.

Three uplink resource allocation schemes type 0 , type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 0 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field.

The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_1 and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_0 , then uplink resource allocation type 1 is used, except when any of the higher layer parameters useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWPUplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured in which case uplink resource allocation type 2 is used.\n---\nThe UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is determined according to clause 8.3 of [6,38.213] or a MsgA PUSCH transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined according to clause 8.1A of [6,38.213].

Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 0 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format 0 \\_1 or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format 0 \\_2 . The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_1 and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_0 , then uplink resource allocation type 1 is used, except when any of the higher layer parameters useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWPUplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured in which case uplink resource allocation type 2 is used. The UE expects that either none or both of uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured. If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active bandwidth part change via DCI, the RB indexing for uplink type 0 , type 1 and type 2 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active bandwidh part change via DCI, the RB indexing for uplink type 0 , type 1 , type 2 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the uplink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined uplink bandwidth part. 6.1.2.2.1 Uplink resource allocation type 0 In uplink resource allocation of type 0 , the resource block assignment information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups (RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter rbg-Size configured in pusch-Config and the size of the bandwidth part as defined in Table 6.1.2.2.1-1. \\begin{table}\n---\nwhere N_{\\text {RB-set,UL }}^{\\text {start }}=0,1, \\cdots N_{\\text {RB-set,UL }}^{\\text {BWP }}-1, L_{\\text {RB-set }} >= 1 and shall not exceed N_{\\text {RB-set,UL }}^{\\text {BWP }}-N_{\\text {RB-set,UL }}^{\\text {start }} If transform precoding is enabled according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.3, then the UE transmits PUSCH on the lowest-indexed M_{\\text {RB }}^{\\text {PUSCH }} PRBs amongst the PRBs indicated by the frequency domain resource assignment information. M_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\mathrm{PUSCH}} is the largest integer not greater than the number of RBs indicated by the frequency domain resource assignment information that fulfils the conditions in Clause 6.3.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. 6.1.2.3 Resource allocation for uplink transmission with configured grant When PUSCH resource allocation is semi-statically configured by higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig in BWP-UplinkDedicated information element, and the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant, the following higher layer parameters are applied in the transmission: - For Type 1 PUSCH transmissions with a configured grant, the following parameters are given in configuredGrantConfig unless mentioned otherwise: - For the determination of the PUSCH repetition type, if the higher layer parameter pusch-RepTypeIndicator in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant is configured and set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', PUSCH repetition type B is applied; otherwise, PUSCH repetition type A is applied; - For PUSCH repetition type A, the selection of the time domain resource allocation table follows the rules for DCI format 0 \\_0 on UE specific search space, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. - For PUSCH repetition type B, the selection of the time domain resource allocation table is as follows: - If pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is configured and set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is used; - Otherwise, pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is used. - It is not expected that pusch-RepTypeIndicator in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant is configured with 'puschRepTypeB' when none of pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 and pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'pusch-RepTypeB'.\n---\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that two hops of a PUSCH transmission are in different RB sets. In case of resource allocation type 2, the UE transmits PUSCH without frequency hopping. In case of resource allocation type 1, whether or not transform precoding is enabled for PUSCH transmission, the UE may perform PUSCH frequency hopping, if the frequency hopping field in a corresponding detected DCI format or in a random access response UL grant is set to 1 , or if for a Type 1 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffset is provided, otherwise no PUSCH frequency hopping is performed. When frequency hopping is enabled for PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of [4, TS 38.211]. For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or by DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TCRNTI, frequency offsets are obtained as described in clause 8.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. Otherwise, for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 and for resource allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config.
