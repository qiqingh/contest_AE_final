A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in one or more CORESETs on the active DL BWP on each activated serving cell configured with PDCCH monitoring according to corresponding search space sets where monitoring implies receiving each PDCCH candidate and decoding according to the monitored DCI formats.

In the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats, and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are also referred to as broadcast DCI formats. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceSIB1 for Type0-PDCCH CSS set by PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1. If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 . If the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency resource, and if the UE is provided searchSpaceBroadcast for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for Type3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the active DL BWP.\n---\nA SFI-index field value in a DCI format 20 indicates to a UE a slot format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 \\_0 . The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The SFI-index field includes \\max \\left\\{\\left[\\log _{2}(\\operatorname{maxSFI}\\right.\\right. inde \\left.\\left.x+1)\\right], 1\\right\\} bits where maxSFlindex is the maximum value of the values provided by corresponding slotFormatCombinationId. A slot format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where ' D ' denotes a downlink symbol, 'U' denotes an uplink symbol, and ' F ' denotes a flexible symbol. If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot. A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2 \\_0 on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.\n---\n- with respect to all serving cells, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception on the RB set or any RB set that is configured as unavailable or configured as soft and not indicated as available during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell is not changed due to a use of the RB set in the symbol by the [AB-DU, or - the [AB-MT detects a DCI format 2 with an AI index field value indicating the soft RB set as available if the [AB-MT is not configured with an SCG, or - the [AB-MT detects two DCI formats 2_5 with an AI index field value indicating the soft RB set as available from the MCG and SCG, respectively, or - the [AB-MT detects a DCI format 2_5 with an AI index field value indicating the soft R B set as available from one cell group and with respect to all serving cells of the other cell group, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell does not change due to a use of the RB set in the symbol by the [AB-DU. When an RB set of a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as unavailable, the [AB-DU neither transmits nor receives in the RB set in the symbol. If an [AB-node is provided an Availabilitylndicator, the [AB-node is provided an AI-RNTI by ai-RNTI and a payload size of a DCI format 2_5 by dci-PayloadSizeAI. The [AB-node is also provided a search space set configuration, by SearchSpace, for monitoring PDCCH. ETSI\n---\nnrofCandidates Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific value is provided (see inside searchSpaceType). If configured in the SearchSpace of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). searchSpaceGroupldList List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0 or 1. If searchSpaceGroup/dList (i.e. without suffix) is included. The network configures at most 3 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0,1 or 2 if searchSpaceGroup/dList-r17 is included. And if searchSpaceGroupldList-r17 is included, searchSpaceGroupldList (i.e. without suffix) is ignored. searchSpaceld Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceld =0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceld is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceld in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active. For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT:each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet; for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent. SearchSpaceLinkingld This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. searchSpaceType Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.\n---\n- searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH on secondary cell for a DCI format 4 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, and - a USS set configured by - SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, or SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI, or - sdt-CG-SearchSpace for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI as described in clause 19.1.
