If t -Reassembly is running, t -Reassembly shall not be started additionally, i.e. only one t -Reassembly per RLC entity is running at a given time. c) t -StatusProhibit This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity in order to prohibit transmission of a STATUS PDU (see sub clause 5.3.4). 7.4 Configurable parameters The following parameters are configured by TS 38.331 [5]: a) maxRetxThreshold This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to limit the number of retransmissions corresponding to an RLC SDU, including its segments (see clause 5.3.2).",
