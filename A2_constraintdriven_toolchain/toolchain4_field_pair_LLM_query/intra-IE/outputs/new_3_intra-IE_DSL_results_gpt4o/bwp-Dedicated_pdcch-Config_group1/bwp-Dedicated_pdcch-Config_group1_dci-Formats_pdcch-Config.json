In the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats, and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are also referred to as broadcast DCI formats. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceSIB1 for Type0-PDCCH CSS set by PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1.\n---\n\\end{table} If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_5 is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats 2-5 indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot. An [AB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2 _ 5 with CRC scrambled by AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets: - a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = common; - a USS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific.\n---\n- PDSCH for MCCH or MTCH and PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI or by P-RNTI A UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by a first or second P U C C H -Config, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast PDCCH or PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN or SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook or pdsch-HARQ-ACKCodebookList, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for HARQ-ACK codebooks associated with multicast HARQ-ACK information is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. A UE monitors PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH receptions or for activation/release of SPS PDSCH receptions for a corresponding SPS PDSCH configuration as described in clause 10.1. A UE can be configured by harq-Feedback-Option-Multicast for a G-RNTI, or by sps-HARQ-Feedback-OptionMulticast for a G-CS-RNTI, to provide HARQ-ACK information for a transport block reception associated with the GRNTI or with the G-CS-RNTI, respectively, according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode or according to the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode. The UE determines a priority for a PUCCH transmission with multicast HARQACK information according to any HARQ-ACK reporting mode as described in clause 9 for a PUCCH transmission with unicast HARQ-ACK information. For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with ACK value when a UE correctly decodes a transport block or detects a DCI format indicating an SPS PDSCH release; otherwise, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with NACK value, as described in clauses 9 and 9.1 through 9.3. For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH that would include only HARQ-ACK information with ACK values. The second HARQ-ACK reporting mode is not applicable when a number of HARQACK information bits is more than four, or for the first SPS PDSCH reception after activation of SPS PDSCH receptions for a SPS configuration, or for DCI formats having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception.

In the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats, and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are also referred to as broadcast DCI formats. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceSIB1 for Type0-PDCCH CSS set by PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1. If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 . If the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency resource, and if the UE is provided searchSpaceBroadcast for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for Type3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the active DL BWP. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.\n---\n- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.",
