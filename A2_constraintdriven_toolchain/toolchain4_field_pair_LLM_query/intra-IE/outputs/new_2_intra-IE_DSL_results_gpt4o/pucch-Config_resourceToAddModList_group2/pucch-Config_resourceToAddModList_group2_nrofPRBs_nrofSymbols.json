    "evidence": "If a UE is provided useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated, the UE determines available RBs for PUCCH transmissions within the active UL BWP as the intersection of RBs corresponding to an interlace index provided by interlace0 and, if provided, interlacel, and RBs of an RB set provided by rb-SetIndex. The intersection results in M_{\\text {interlace }, 0}^{\\text {PUCCH }} RBs in the first interlace and the UE expects that M_{\\text {interlace }, 0}^{\\text {PUCCH }} is either 10 or 11 .
