For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'.",
