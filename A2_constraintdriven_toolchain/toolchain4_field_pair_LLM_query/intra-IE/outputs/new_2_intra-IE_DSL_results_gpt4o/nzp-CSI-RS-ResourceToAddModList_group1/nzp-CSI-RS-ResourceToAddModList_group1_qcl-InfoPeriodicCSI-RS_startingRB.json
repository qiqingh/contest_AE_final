    "evidence": "- BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'. All CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement. The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same cdm-type. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, the slot offsets of the two resources in a Resource Pair are configured within X \\in\\{1,[2]\\} slots, without DL/UL switching in between the two resources, where X=1 implies that the two resources are configured in the same slot, and X=2 implies that the two resources are configured within two adjacent slots.",
