    "evidence": "the duration of periodicityAndPattern in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). A configured group rateMatchPatternGroup 1 or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 contains a list of indices of RateMatchPattern(s) forming a union of resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding bit of the 'Rate matching indicator' field of the DCI format 1_1 scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union of resource-sets configured by RateMatchPattern(s) that are not included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_1 , and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1 \\_0 , the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in rateMatchPatternGroupl or rateMatchPatternGroup 2 are not available for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching indicator field of the DCI format 1_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is equal to 1. For a bitmap pair included in one or two groups of resource sets, the dynamic indication of availability for PDSCH applies to a set of slot(s) where the rateMatchPatternToAddModList is present among the slots of scheduled PDSCH. If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 with the same starting CCE index in noninterleaved CORESET spanning one OFDM symbol: - and if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH has aggregation level 8 , the resources corresponding to the aggregation level 16 PDCCH candidate are not available for the PDSCH ; - when at least one of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 linked as indicated by higher layer parameter searchSpaceLinking, the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 16 and any other PDCCH candidate(s) linked with any of the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 and 16 are not available for the PDSCH reception at the UE, if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH is associated with the PDCCH candidates of aggregation level 8 or 16 . If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH. 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity",
