    "evidence": "A UE is not expected to be configured with an aperiodic CSI trigger state containing more than N_{C P U} Reporting Settings. Processing of a CSI report occupies a number of CPUs for a number of symbols as follows: - O_{C P U}=0 for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none' and CSI-RS-ResourceSet with higher layer parameter trs-Info configured - O_{C P U}=1 for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRPCapability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set]Index', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index 'or 'none' (and CSI-RS-ResourceSet with higher layer parameter trs-Info not configured) - for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', - if \\max \\left\\{\\mu_{P O C C H}, \\mu_{C S I-R S}, \\mu_{U L}\\right\\} <= slant 3 , and if a CSI report is aperiodically triggered without transmitting a PUSCH with either transport block or HARQ-ACK or both when L=0 CPUs are occupied, where the CSI corresponds to a single CSI with wideband frequency-granularity and to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', O_{C P U}=N_{C P U} , - [If a CSI-ReportConfig is configured with codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement is configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, O_{C P U}=2 N+M , where M is defined in clause 5.2.1.4.2.] - otherwise, O_{C P U}=K_{S} , where K_{s} is the number of CSI-RS resources in the CSI-RS resource set for channel measurement.\n---\nFor Type I, Type II, Enhanced Type II and Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection CSI feedback on PUSCH, a CSI report comprises of two parts. Part 1 has a fixed payload size and is used to identify the number of information bits in Part 2. Part 1 shall be transmitted in its entirety before Part 2. - For Type I CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword (if reported). Part 2 contains PMI (if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4. For a CSI-ReportConfig configured with codebookType set to 'typelSinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, Part 1 contains RI(s), CRI(s), CQI(s) for the first codeword and is zero padded to a fixed payload size (if needed). Part 2 contains the CQI(s) for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4, LIs (if reported) and PMI(s). - For Type II CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients per layer for the Type [I CSI (see Clause 5.2.2.2.3). The fields of Part 1 - RI (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients for each layer are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI and LI (if reported) of the Type [[] CSI. The elements of i_{1,4, l} , i_{2,1, l} (if reported) and i_{2,2, l} (if reported) are reported in the increasing order of their indices, i=0,1, \\ldots, 2 L-1 , where the element of the lowest index is mapped to the most significant bits and the element of the highest index is mapped to the least significant bits. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded. - For Enhanced Type [I CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5) and Further Enhanced Type [I Port Selection CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5), Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers. The fields of Part 1-\\mathrm{RI} (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers - are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI of the Enhanced Type [I or Further Enhanced Type [I Port Selection CSI. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded. A Type [] CSI report that is carried on the PUSCH shall be computed independently from any Type [] CSI report that is carried on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 (see Clause 5.2.4 and 5.2.2). When the higher layer parameter reportQuantity is configured with one of the values 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'criS[NR' or 'ssb-Index-S[NR', or 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'ssb-[ndex-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-S[NRCapability[Set]Index ', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index ',the CSI feedback consists of a single part. For both Type I and Type II reports configured for PUCCH but transmitted on PUSCH, the determination of the payload for CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 follows that of PUCCH as described in Clause 5.2.4.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5-4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5.4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the reportQuantity is set to 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index ', or",
