A CSI Reporting Setting with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, can be configured with wideband frequency-granularity only if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X=0 , as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2. If the UE is configured with a CSI Reporting Setting for a bandwidth part with fewer than 24 PRBs, the CSI reporting setting is expected to have a wideband frequency-granularity, and, if applicable, the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel'.

If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic. A UE configured with DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 does not expect to be triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same CSI-ReportConfigld.\n---\nFor semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s): - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources. An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 <= K_{s} <= 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} >= 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} >= 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs. Each Resource Pair consists of one resource from Group 1 and one resource from Group 2. The same resource can be associated with two Resource Pairs in frequency range 1 but not in frequency range 2.\n---\n72 ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - The UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel', and - The UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI(s) conditioned on the reported CRI(s), as follows: - If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to X \\in\\{0,1,2\\}, X+1 \\mathrm{CRI}(\\mathrm{s}) are reported: - one CRI k_{1}\\left(k_{1} >= 0\\right) corresponds to the configured ( k_{1}+1 )-th entry of the associated N Resource Pairs in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( M+k_{1}+1 )-th entry of the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured.
