    "evidence": "- PT-RS is transmitted to the UE. The UE is not expected to simultaneously be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter maxLength being set equal to 'len2' and more than one additional DM-RS symbol as given by the higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition. The UE is not expected to assume co-scheduled UE(s) with different DM-RS configuration with respect to the actual number of front-loaded DM-RS symbol(s), the actual number of additional DM-RS, the DM-RS symbol location, and DM-RS configuration type as described in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211]. The UE does not expect the precoding of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be different in the PRG-level grid configured to this UE with PRG =2 or 4 . The UE does not expect the resource allocation of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be misaligned in the PRG-level grid to this UE with PRG=2 or 4 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _1, the UE shall assume that the CDM groups indicated in the configured index from Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-2A, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] contain potential co-scheduled downlink DM-RS and are not used for data transmission, where \" 1 \", \" 2 \" and \" 3 \" for the number of DM-RS CDM group(s) in Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] correspond to CDM group 0,\\{0,1\\},\\{0,1,2\\} , respectively.\n---\nnrofSlotsMsgA-PUSCH Number of slots (in active UL BWP numerology) containing one or multiple PUSCH occasions, each slot has the same time domain resource allocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A). startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO An index giving valid combinations of start symbol, length and mapping type as start and length indicator (SLIV) for the first msgA PUSCH occasion, for RRC_CONNECTED UEs in non-initial BWP as described in TS 38.214 [19] clause 6.1.2. The network configures the field so that the allocation does not cross the slot boundary. The number of occupied symbols excludes the guard period. If the field is absent, the UE shall use the value in msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A). The network configures one of msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation and startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, but not both. If the field is absent, the UE shall use the value of msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation. \\begin{tabular}{|l|} MsgA-DMRS-Config field descriptions \\begin{tabular}{l} msgA-DMRS-AdditionalPosition Indicates the position for additional DM-RS. If the field is absent, the UE applies value pos2. \\end{tabular}",
