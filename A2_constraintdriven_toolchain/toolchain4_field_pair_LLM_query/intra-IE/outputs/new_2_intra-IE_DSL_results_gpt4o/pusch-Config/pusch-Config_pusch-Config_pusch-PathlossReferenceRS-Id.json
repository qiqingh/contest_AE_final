If the UE is provided pusch-Config for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.
