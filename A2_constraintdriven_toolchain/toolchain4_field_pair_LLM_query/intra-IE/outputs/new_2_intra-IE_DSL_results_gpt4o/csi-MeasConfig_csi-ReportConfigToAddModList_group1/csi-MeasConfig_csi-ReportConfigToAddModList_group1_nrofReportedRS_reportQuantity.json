    "evidence": "- the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication ( i_{1} in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', - the UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and pmi-FormatIndicator set to 'widebandPMI' and, - the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication ( i_{1} in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band. The CQ[ is calculated conditioned on the reported i_{1} assuming PDSCH transmission with N_{p} >= 1 precoders (corresponding to the same i_{1} but different i_{2} in Clause 5.2.2.2.1), where the UE assumes that one precoder is randomly selected from the set of N_{p} precoders for each PRG on PDSCH, where the PRG size for CQI calculation is configured by the higher layer parameter pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-CQI', - if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, r ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank r and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \\ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \\ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} of port indices, where p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank v and R \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, P\\} where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks. - if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication, the UE assumes, for each CSIRS resource in the CSI resource setting linked to the CSI-ReportConfig, that the CSI-RS port indices p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)}=\\{0, \\ldots, v-1\\} are associated with ranks v=1,2, \\ldots, P where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. - When calculating the CQI for a rank, the UE shall use the ports indicated for that rank for the selected CSI-RS resource. The precoder for the indicated ports shall be assumed to be the identity matrix scaled by \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v}} . If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive filters.\n---\n- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 , the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance nrofReportedRSgroup, if configured, group(s) of two CRIs or SSBRIs selecting one CSI-RS or SSB from each of the two CSI Resource Sets for the report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources of each group can be received simultaneously by the UE. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set][ndex', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], a CSI-SSB-ResourceSet configured for L1-RSRP reporting includes one or more sets of SSB indices where PCI indices are associated with the sets of SSB indices, respectively. When the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to ' cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' an index of UE capability value set, indicating the maximum supported number of SRS antenna ports, is reported along with the pair of SSBRI/CRI and L1-RSRP. 5.2.1.4.4 L1-SINR Reporting For L1-SINR computation, for channel measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH Block resources, for interference measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resources. - for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64 CSI -RS resources or up to 64 \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} Block resources. For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value is defined by a 7-bit value in the range [-23,40] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', the UE shall use differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range [ -23,40 ] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a 4 -bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset. When one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement",
