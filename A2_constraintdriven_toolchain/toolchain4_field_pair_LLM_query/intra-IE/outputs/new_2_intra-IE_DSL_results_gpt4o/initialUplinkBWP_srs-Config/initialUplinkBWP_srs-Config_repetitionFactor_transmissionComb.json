When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is not configured ( R=N_{s} ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped in all the N_{s} symbols to the same set of subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition ( R=1 ), according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{\\text {SRS }}, C_{\\text {SRS }} and b_{\\text {hop }} defined in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within an SRS resource in each slot are configured ( N_{s} >= 4, R >= 2 ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and frequency hopping across the \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs is according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{S R S}, C_{S R S} and b_{\\text {hop }} , where N_{S} should be divisible by R . For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that multiple hops of an SRS resource transmission are in different RB sets.",
