When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch set to 'sfnSchemeA', and the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in a DCI scheduling a PDSCH, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDSCH is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states. When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch set to 'sfnSchemeB', and the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in a DCI scheduling a PDSCH, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDSCH is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states except for quasi co-location parameters \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\} of the second indicated TCI state. 5.1.6 UE procedure for receiving reference signals 5.1.6.1 CSI-RS reception procedure The CSI-RS defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], may be used for time/frequency tracking, CSI computation, L1-RSRP computation, L1-SINR computation, mobility, and tracking during fast SCell activation.\n---\n- if the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 26 and configured by higher layer parameter p s -TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to cri-RSRP when drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config is not started, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active time or during the time duration indicated by d r x onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside DRX active time for CSI to be reported; - otherwise, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active time for CSI to be reported. 5.1.6.1.1 CSI-RS for tracking A UE in RRC connected mode is expected to receive the higher layer UE specific configuration of a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. For a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE shall assume the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is the same.\n---\n- powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - the QCL information for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter s s b -Index configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is a SS/PBCH block, applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - One or more scramblingIDs where if a single scramblingID is configured, it applies to all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the resource set, otherwise, each NZP-CSI-RS resource is provided with a scramblingID. - the UE may assume the following quasi co-location type(s): - 'typeC' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same SS/PBCH block. For each TRS-ResourceSet the index of the associated bit in TRS availability indication field [5, TS 38.212], is given by the higher layer parameter indBitID. 5.1.6.1.1.1 Aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation A UE can be configured with aperiodic CSI-RS resources for tracking for an SCell for fast SCell activation using N Z P -CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) with the higher layer parameter scellActivationRS-ConfigToAddModList, with the QCL relation as with aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking in clause 5.1.6.1.1. Each CSI-RS resource, defined in clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], for fast SCell activation is configured by the higher layer parameter NZP-CSI-RS-Resource with the same restrictions as defined for CSI-RS for tracking in clause 5.1.6.1.1. 5.1.6.1.2 CSI-RS for L1-RSRP and L1-SINR computation If a UE is configured with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on', the UE may assume that the CSI-RS resources, described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1, within the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter, where the CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-\n---\nResourceSet are transmitted in different OFDM symbols. If repetition is set to 'off', the UE shall not assume that the CSI-RS resources within the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'none' and if the CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) contains a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet that is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition and without the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE can only be configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer parameter nrofPorts for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block. 5.1.6.1.3 CSI-RS for mobility If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility and the higher layer parameter associatedSSB is not configured, the UE shall perform measurements based on CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility and the UE may base the timing of the CSI-RS resource on the timing of the serving cell. If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility and associatedSSB, the UE may base the timing of the CSI-RS resource on the timing of the cell given by the cellld of the CSI-RS resource configuration. Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH block is configured but not detected by the UE, the UE is not required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource. The higher layer parameter isQuasiColocated indicates whether the associated SS/PBCH block given by the associatedSSB and the CSI-RS resource(s) are quasi colocated with respect to 'typeD', when applicable. If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility and with periodicity greater than 10 msec in paired spectrum, the UE may assume the absolute value of the time difference between radio frame i between any two cells, listed in the configuration with the higher layer parameter CSI-RS-CellMobility and with same refFreqCSI-RS, is less than 153600 T_{s} . If the UE is configured with DRX, the UE is not required to perform measurement of CSI-RS resources other than during the active time for measurements based on CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_6, the UE is not required to perform measurements other than during the active time and during the timer duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time based on CSI-RS-ResourceMobility. If the UE is configured with DRX and DRX cycle in use is larger than 80 msec , the UE may not expect CSI-RS resources are available other than during the active time for measurements based on CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility. If the UE is configured with DRX and configured to monitor DCI format 2_6 and DRX cycle in use is larger than 80 msec , the UE may not expect that the CSI-RS resources are available other than during the active time and during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time for measurements based on CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility. Otherwise, the UE may assume CSI-RS are available for measurements based on CSI-RS-ResourceMobility.\n---\nNOTE: The Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is not used if a DRB is configured with more than two RLC entities, i.e. with moreThanTwoRLC-DRB. 6.1.3.12 SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE The SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1. It has a variable size and consists of the following fields: - A/D: This field indicates whether to activate or deactivate indicated SP CSI-RS and CSI-[M resource set(s). The field is set to 1 to indicate activation, otherwise it indicates deactivation; - Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits; - BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - SP CSI-RS resource set ID: This field contains an index of NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet containing Semi Persistent NZP CSI-RS resources, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the Semi Persistent NZP CSI-RS resource set, which shall be activated or deactivated. The length of the field is 6 bits; - IM: This field indicates the presence of the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field. If the IM field is set to 1 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is present. If IM field is set to 0 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is not present;\n---\n- the band width and the frequency location of the NZP CSI-RS resource, is given by the higher layer parameter nrofRBs, startingRB and frequencyDomainAllocation in a TRS-ResourceSet and applies to all resources in a TRSResourceSet. Band width, nrofRBs, and the initial CRB index, startingRB, of the NZP CSI-RS resource configured by TRS-ResourceSet are not restricted by initial DL BWP. - UE is not required to receive TRS occasions outside the initial DL BWP. - the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet. - the UE does not expect the TRS-ResourceSet to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of NZP CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the UE may assume the sub-carrier spacing of the NZP CSI-RS resources configured by TRS-ResourceSet to be same as the sub-carrier spacing of the initial DL BWP. - powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - the QCL information for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter s s b -Index configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is a SS/PBCH block, applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. - One or more scramblingIDs where if a single scramblingID is configured, it applies to all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the resource set, otherwise, each NZP-CSI-RS resource is provided with a scramblingID. - the UE may assume the following quasi co-location type(s): - 'typeC' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same SS/PBCH block. For each TRS-ResourceSet the index of the associated bit in TRS availability indication field [5, TS 38.212], is given by the higher layer parameter indBitID. 5.1.6.1.1.1 Aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation A UE can be configured with aperiodic CSI-RS resources for tracking for an SCell for fast SCell activation using N Z P -CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) with the higher layer parameter scellActivationRS-ConfigToAddModList, with the QCL relation as with aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking in clause 5.1.6.1.1.\n---\nSCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{\\text {mac }} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\mathrm{mac}} is provided by K-M a c or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K-M a c is not provided - When the number of CSI triggering states in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is less than or equal to 2^{N_{T s}}-1 , the CSI request field in DCI directly indicates the triggering state. - For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi co-location type(s), as described in clause 5.1.5, through higher layer signaling of qcl-info which contains a list of references to TCIState's for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the CSI triggering state. If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. - If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], when the reported value is one of the values of \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, or is smaller than 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16, enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameter repetition, or is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on'. - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet - if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoolIndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48. 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} when the reported value of beamSwitchTiming-r 16 is one of the values \\{224,336\\} . 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}{ }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS;\n---\nwhere ( Z_{3}, Z_{3}^{\\prime} ) are defined in the table 5.4-2. In any slot, the UE is not expected to have more active CSI-RS ports or active CSI-RS resources in active BWPs than reported as capability. NZP CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used. For semi-persistent CSI-RS, starting from the end of when the activation command is applied, and ending at the end of when the deactivation command is applied. For periodic CSI-RS, starting when the periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layer signalling, and ending when the periodic CSI-RS configuration is released. If a CSI-RS resource is referred N times by one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted N times. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, if a CSIRS resource is referred X times by one of the M CSI-RS resources, where M is defined in clause 5.2.1.4.2, and/or one or two Resource Pairs, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted X times. 5.2.2 Channel state information 5.2.2.1 Channel quality indicator (CQI)\n---\nFor coefficients with k_{l, i, f}^{(3)}=0 , amplitude and phase are set to zero, i.e., p_{l, i, f}^{(2)}=0 and \\varphi_{l, i, f}=0 . 5.2.2.3 Reference signal (CSI-RS) 5.2.2.3.1 NZP CSI-RS The UE can be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS resource set configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameters CSI-ResourceConfig, and NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet.

For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid. - cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits.\n---\nIf there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot n^{\\prime} . After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI to report CSI with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to quantities other than 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP- Capability[Set]Index', and 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index ' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report CSI during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in Clause 5-2-1.4 if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.

When deriving CSI feedback, the UE is not expected that a NZP CSI -RS resource for channel measurement overlaps with CSI-IM resource for interference measurement or NZP CSI -RS resource for interference measurement. If configured to report CQI index, in the CSI reference resource, the UE shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving the CQI index, and if also configured, for deriving PMI and RI :\n---\n- if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s) including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol Z_{\\text {ref }} , and - if the first uplink symbol to carry the n -th CSI report including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol Z_{\\text {ref }}^{\\prime}(n) , where Z_{\\text {ref }} is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting T_{\\text {wo.CE }}=(Z)(2048+144) \\cdot K 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{c}}+T_{\\text {meach }} after the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the CSI report(s), and where Z_{\\text {ref }}(n) , is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting T^{\\dagger}{ }_{\\sigma \\alpha \\cdot C V}=\\left(Z^{\\prime}\\right)(2048+144) \\cdot K 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{c}} after the end of the last symbol in time of the latest of: aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for the n -th triggered CSI report, and where T_{\\text {switch }} is defined in clause 6.4 and is applied only if Z_{1} of table 5.4-1 is applied.
