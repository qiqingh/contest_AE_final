    "evidence": "A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0 . The UE is also configured a periodicity S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} in symbols or slots and an offset S R_{\\text {OFFSET }} in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu}[4 , TS 38.211] in a frame with number n_{f} if \\left(n_{f} \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\\mu}-S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 . If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is one slot, the UE expects that S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}=0 and every slot is a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH. If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to start in a symbol with index l[4, \\mathrm{TS} 38.211] if \\left(l-l_{0} \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 where l_{0} is the value of startingSymbollndex. If the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH, the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is smaller than the value provided by nrofSymbols, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in the slot. SR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1. The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining m_{0} as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 . For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting b(0)=0 . 9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types",
