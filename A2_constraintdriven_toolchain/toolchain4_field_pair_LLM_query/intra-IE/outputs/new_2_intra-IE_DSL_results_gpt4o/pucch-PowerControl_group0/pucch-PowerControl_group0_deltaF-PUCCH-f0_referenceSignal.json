    "evidence": "- If the UE is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB - If the UE is provided a number of RS resource indexes, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using RS resource with index q_{d} , where 0 <= q_{d}<Q_{d}-Q_{d} is a size for a set of RS resources provided by maxNrofPUCCHPathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources is provided by pathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource in the set of RS resources to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by indexes provided by corresponding values of pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id, between a set of pucchSpatialRelationInfold values and a set of referenceSignal values provided by PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS. If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo includes servingCellld indicating a serving cell, the UE receives the RS for resource index q_{d} on the active DL BWP of the serving cell - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines the referenceSignal values in PUCCHPathlossReferenceRS that are indicated in the one or two sets of power control parameter - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo and is not provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, the UE obtains the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS from the pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id with index 0 in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS where the RS resource is either on the primary cell or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking - If the UE - is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs, and - is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, and - is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH, and - is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212] the UE determines a RS resource index q_{d} providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP of the primary cell. If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the RS resource index q_{d} based on the first activated TCI state. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a same q_{d} applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple slots. - The parameter \\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}_{\\mathrm{P}} \\mathrm{PCCH}}(F) is a value of deltaF-PUCCH-fofor PUCCH format 0 , deltaF-PUCCH-fl for PUCCH format 1, deltaF-PUCCH-f2 for PUCCH format 2, deltaF-PUCCH-f3 for PUCCH format 3, and deltaF-PUCCH-f4 for PUCCH format 4, if provided; otherwise \\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}_{-} \\mathrm{PUCCH}}(F)=0 . - \\quad \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i) is a PUCCH transmission power adjustment component on active UL BWP b of carrier f of primary cell c",
