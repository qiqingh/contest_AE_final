    "evidence": "- A/D: This field indicates whether to activate or deactivate indicated SP CSI-RS and CSI-[M resource set(s). The field is set to 1 to indicate activation, otherwise it indicates deactivation; - Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits; - BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - SP CSI-RS resource set ID: This field contains an index of NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet containing Semi Persistent NZP CSI-RS resources, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the Semi Persistent NZP CSI-RS resource set, which shall be activated or deactivated. The length of the field is 6 bits; - IM: This field indicates the presence of the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field. If the IM field is set to 1 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is present. If IM field is set to 0 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is not present;\n---\nETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08) - SP CSI-IM resource set ID: This field contains an index of CSI-IM-ResourceSet containing Semi Persistent CSIIM resources, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the Semi Persistent CSI-[M resource set, which shall be activated or deactivated. The length of the field is 6 bits; - TCI State [D1: This field contains TCI-Stateld, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], of a TCI State, which is used as QCL source for the resource within the Semi Persistent NZP CSI-RS resource set indicated by SP CSI-RS resource set ID field. TCI State [D0 indicates TCI State for the first resource within the set, TCI State [D1 for the second one and so on. The length of the field is 7 bits. If the A / D field is set to 0 , the octets containing TCI State ID field(s) are not present; - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 . Figure 6.1.3.12-1: SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE 6.1.3.13 Aperiodic CSI Trigger State Subselection MAC CE The Aperiodic CSI Trigger State Subselection MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1. It has a variable size consisting of following fields: - Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits; - BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - T_{1} : This field indicates the selection status of the Aperiodic Trigger States configured within aperiodicTriggerStateList, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. \\mathrm{T}_{0} refers to the first trigger state within the list, \\mathrm{T}_{1} to the second one and so on. If the list does not contain entry with index i , MAC entity shall ignore the \\mathrm{T}_{1} field. The T, field is set to 1 to indicate that the Aperiodic Trigger State i shall be mapped to the codepoint of the DCI CSI request field, as specified in TS 38.214 [7]. The codepoint to which the Aperiodic Trigger State is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the Aperiodic Trigger States with T_{1} field set to 1, i.e. the first Aperiodic Trigger State with \\mathrm{T}_{1} field set to 1 shall be mapped to the codepoint value 1, second Aperiodic Trigger State with T_{1} field set to 1 shall be mapped to the codepoint value 2 and so on. The maximum number of mapped Aperiodic Trigger States is 63; - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .\n---\n- density in resourceMapping defines CSI-RS frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB, and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density value of 1 / 2 , where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4 - 1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid. - cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits. - BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the configured CSI-RS is located in. - repetition in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set][ndex' or 'none'. - qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell.",
