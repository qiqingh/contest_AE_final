When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used. For codebook based transmission, the UE determines its codebook subsets based on TPMI(s) and upon the reception of higher layer parameter codebookSubset in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 0 \\_1 and codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 02 which may be configured with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent', or 'partialAndNonCoherent', or 'nonCoherent' depending on the UE capability. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2' and the higher layer parameter codebookSubset or the higher layer parameter codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 is set to 'partialAndNonCoherent', and when the SRS-resourceSet with usage set to \"codebook\" includes at least one SRS resource with 4 ports and one SRS resource with 2 ports, the codebookSubset associated with the 2 -port SRS resource is 'nonCoherent'. The maximum transmission rank may be configured by the higher layer parameter maxRank in pusch-Config for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_1 and maxRankDCI-0-2 for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_2. A UE reporting its UE capability of 'partialAndNonCoherent' transmission shall not expect to be configured by either codebookSubset or codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent'. A UE reporting its UE capability of 'nonCoherent' transmission shall not expect to be configured by either codebookSubset or codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent' or with 'partialAndNonCoherent'. A UE shall not expect to be configured with the higher layer parameter codebookSubset or the higher layer parameter codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 set to 'partialAndNonCoherent' when higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in an SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' indicates that the maximum number of the configured SRS antenna ports in the SRS-ResourceSet is two. ETSI\n---\nThe DM-RS antenna ports \\left\\{\\widetilde{p}_{0, \\ldots,} \\widetilde{p}_{v-1}\\right\\} in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of [4, TS38.211] are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212]. Except when higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2', when multiple SRS resources are configured by SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook', the UE shall expect that higher layer parameters nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Resource in SRS-ResourceSet shall be configured with the same value for all these SRS resources. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2', - the UE can be configured with one SRS resource or multiple SRS resources with same or different number of SRS ports within an SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook'. - up to 2 different spatial relations can be configured for all SRS resources in the SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook' when multiple SRS resources are configured in the SRS resource set. - subject to UE capability, a maximum of 2 or 4 SRS resources are supported in an SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook'. 6.1.1.2 Non-Codebook based UL transmission For non-codebook based transmission, PUSCH can be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_1, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_2 or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3. If this PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0_1, DCI format 0 \\_2 , or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE can determine its PUSCH precoder(s) and transmission rank based on the SRI(s) when multiple SRS resources are configured, where the SRI(s) is given by one or two SRS resource indicator(s) in DCI according to clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5,38.212] for DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 , or the SRI is given by srs-ResourceIndicator according to clause 6.1.2.3, or two SRIs given by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator 2 according to clause 6.1.2.3. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) applicable for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 in SRS-config, respectively. The UE shall use one or multiple SRS resources for SRS transmission, where, in a SRS resource set, the maximum number of SRS resources which can be configured to the UE for simultaneous transmission in the same symbol and the maximum number of SRS resources are UE capabilities. The SRS resources transmitted simultaneously occupy the same RBs. Only one SRS port for each SRS resource is configured. Only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', and only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook'. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', one or two SRIs are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicators in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6.1.2.1. The maximum number of SRS resources per SRS resource set that can be configured for non-codebook based uplink transmission is 4 . Each of the indicated one or two SRIs in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS transmission is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used.",
