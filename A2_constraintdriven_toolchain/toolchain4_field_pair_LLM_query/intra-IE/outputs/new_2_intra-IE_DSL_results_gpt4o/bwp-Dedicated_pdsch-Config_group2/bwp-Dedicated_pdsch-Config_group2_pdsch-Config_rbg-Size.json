When a UE is configured with nominal RBG size P=2 for bandwidth part i according to Clause 5.1.2.2.1, or when a UE is configured with interleaving unit of 2 for VRB to PRB mapping provided by the higher layer parameter vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config for band width part i , the UE is not expected to be configured with P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime}= 4. For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'fdmScheme A' or 'fdmSchemeB', and when the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)',\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} rateMatchPatternGroup2, rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 The IDs of a second group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP Ievel) or in ServingCellConfig >rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). The field rateMatchPatternGroup2 applies to DCI format 1_1, and the field rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 applies to DCI format 1 _ 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} rateMatchPatternToAddModList Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around.

In downlink resource allocation of type 0 scheduled using a DCI with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the resource block assignment information bitmap is calculated based on the description above with the following changes: the parameter N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {start }} is the starting PRB of the CFR, N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {size }} is the size of the common frequency resource (CFR) and the value of the higher layer parameter rbg-Size is configured by PDSCH-Config-Multicast. The bitmap is of size N_{\\text {RBG }} bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each RBG is addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing frequency and starting at the lowest frequency of the bandwidth part. The order of RBG bitmap is such that RBG 0 to RBG N_{\\text {RBG }}-1 are mapped from MSB to LSB. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the corresponding bit value in the bitmap is 1 , the RBG is not allocated to the UE otherwise.",
