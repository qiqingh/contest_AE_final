In case a SRS resource with resourceType set as 'aperiodic' is triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic/semi-persistent SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the aperiodic SRS resource and only the periodic/semi-persistent SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic/semipersistent SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with the aperiodic SRS resource are transmitted. In case a SRS resource with resourceType set as 'semi-persistent' is triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the semi-persistent SRS resource and only the periodic SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with the semi-persistent SRS resource are transmitted. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', and a guard period of Y symbols is configured according to Clause 6.2.1.2, the UE shall use the same priority rules as defined above during the guard period as if SRS was configured. When a spatialRelationInfo is activated/updated for a semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource by a MAC CE for a set of CCs/BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs provided by higher layer parameter simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 1 or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 2 is determined by the indicated CC in the MAC CE, the spatialRelationInfo is applied for the semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource(s) with the same SRS resource ID for all the BWPs in the determined CCs. When the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS is set 'enabled', and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo for the SRS resource, except for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'beamManagement' or for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' with configuration of associatedCSI-RS or for the SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, is not configured in FR2 and if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter(s) pathlossReferenceRS, and if the UE is not configured with different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSets, and is not provided at least one TCI codepoint mapped with two TCI states, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource in an active UL BWP of a CC,",
