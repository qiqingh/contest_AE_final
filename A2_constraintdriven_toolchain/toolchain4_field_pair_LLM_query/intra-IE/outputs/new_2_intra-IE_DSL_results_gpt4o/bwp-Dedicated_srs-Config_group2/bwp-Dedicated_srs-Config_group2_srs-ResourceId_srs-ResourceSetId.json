The field is set to 00 to indicate NZP CSI-RS resource index is used; it is set to 01 to indicate SSB index is used; it is set to 10 to indicate SRS resource index is used; it is set to 11 to indicate DL-PRS index is used.

The field is set to 0 to indicate SRS resource index SRS-Resourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5] is used; the field is set to 1 to indicate Positioning SRS resource index SRS-PosResourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5] is used; - NZP CSI-RS Resource ID: This field contains an index of NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceID, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the NZP CSI-RS resource, which is used to derive the spatial relation for the positioning SRS. The length of the field is 8 bits; - SSB index: This field contains an index of SSB SSB-Index as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and/or TS 37.355 [23].
