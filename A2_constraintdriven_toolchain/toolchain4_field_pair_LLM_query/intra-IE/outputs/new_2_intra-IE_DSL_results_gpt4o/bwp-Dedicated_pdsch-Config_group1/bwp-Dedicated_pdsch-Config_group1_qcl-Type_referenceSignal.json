Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Typel for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type 2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread\\} - 'typeB': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\} - 'typeC': \\{Doppler shift, average delay\\} - 'typeD': \\{Spatial Rx parameter\\} The UE can be configured with a list of up to 128 DLorJointTCIState configurations, within the higher layer parameter PDSCH-Config for providing a reference signal for the quasi co-location for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH in a CC, for CSI-RS, and to provide a reference, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. ETSI\n---\nPUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell. The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. ETSI\n---\nThe UE shall maintain power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to frequency hopping, or in response to the use of a different SRS resource set association for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B , or in response to the use of different spatial relations or different power control parameters for the two PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, or in response to any event not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE. The UE maintains power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to an event triggered by DCI other than frequency hopping or by MAC-CE, subject to UE capability. 6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure 6.2.1 UE sounding procedure The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K >= 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously. When the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter t r s -Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. For aperiodic SRS at least one state of the DCI field is used to select at least one out of the configured SRS resource set(s).\n---\n- If the UE is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB - If the UE is provided a number of RS resource indexes, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using RS resource with index q_{d} , where 0 <= q_{d}<Q_{d}-Q_{d} is a size for a set of RS resources provided by maxNrofPUCCHPathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources is provided by pathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource in the set of RS resources to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by indexes provided by corresponding values of pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id, between a set of pucchSpatialRelationInfold values and a set of referenceSignal values provided by PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS. If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo includes servingCellld indicating a serving cell, the UE receives the RS for resource index q_{d} on the active DL BWP of the serving cell - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines the referenceSignal values in PUCCHPathlossReferenceRS that are indicated in the one or two sets of power control parameter - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo and is not provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, the UE obtains the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS from the pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id with index 0 in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS where the RS resource is either on the primary cell or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking - If the UE - is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs, and - is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, and - is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH, and - is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212] the UE determines a RS resource index q_{d} providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP of the primary cell. If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the RS resource index q_{d} based on the first activated TCI state. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a same q_{d} applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple slots. - The parameter \\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}_{\\mathrm{P}} \\mathrm{PCCH}}(F) is a value of deltaF-PUCCH-fofor PUCCH format 0 , deltaF-PUCCH-fl for PUCCH format 1, deltaF-PUCCH-f2 for PUCCH format 2, deltaF-PUCCH-f3 for PUCCH format 3, and deltaF-PUCCH-f4 for PUCCH format 4, if provided; otherwise \\Delta_{\\mathrm{F}_{-} \\mathrm{PUCCH}}(F)=0 . - \\quad \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i) is a PUCCH transmission power adjustment component on active UL BWP b of carrier f of primary cell c\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} cell The UE's serving cell in which the referenceSignal is configured. If the field is absent, it applies to the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured. The RS can be located on a serving cell other than the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured only if the qc/-Type is configured as typeC or typeD. See TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} referenceSignal Reference signal with which quasi-collocation information is provided as specified in TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l} qci-Type QCL type as specified in TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5. \\end{tabular}\n---\n- If a UE is configured with enableTwoDefaultTCI-States, and at least one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH or PDSCH transmission occasions of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) associated with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states. When the UE is configured by higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' or is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber, and the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the first PDSCH transmission occasion is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL, the mapping of the TCI states to PDSCH transmission occasions is determined according to clause 5.1.2.1 by replacing the indicated TCI states with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the first PDSCH transmission occasion. In this case, if the 'QCL-TypeD' in both of the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers) - If a UE is not configured with sfnSchemePdsch, and the UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and there is no TCI codepoint witih two TCI states in the activation command and the CORESET with the lowest ID in the latest slot is indicated with two TCI states, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) associated with the first TCI state of two TCI states indicated for the CORESET. - In all cases above, if none of configured TCI states for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE shall obtain the other QCL assumptions from the indicated TCI state(s) for its scheduled PDSCH irrespective of the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH. If the PDCCH carrying the scheduling DCI is received on one component carrier, and a PDSCH scheduled by that DCI is on another component carrier: - The timeDurationForQCL is determined based on the subcarrier spacing of the scheduled PDSCH. If \\mu_{\\mathrm{PDCCH}}< \\mu_{\\text {PDSCH }} an additional timing delay d \\frac{2 \\mu_{\\text {PDSCH }}}{2^{\\mu_{\\text {PDCH }}}} is added to the timeDurationForQCL, where d is defined in 5.2.1.5.1a-1, otherwise d is zero; - When the UE is configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL, or if the DL DCI does not have the TCI field present, the UE obtains its QCL assumption for the scheduled PDSCH from the activated TCI state with the lowest ID applicable to PDSCH in the active BWP of the scheduled cell. A UE that has indicated a capability beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping set to '1', as described in [18, TS 38.822], can determine a spatial domain filter to be used while performing the applicable channel access procedures described in [16, TS 37.213] to transmit a UL transmission on the channel as follows: - if UE is indicated with an SRI corresponding to the UL transmission, the UE may use a spatial domain filter that is same as the spatial domain transmission filter associated with the indicated SRI, - if UE is configured with TCI-State configurations with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE may use a spatial domain transmit filter that is same as the spatial domain receive filter the UE may use to receive the DL reference signal associated with the indicated TCI state. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the",
