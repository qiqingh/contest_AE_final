The value N_{2} in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in clause 6.4, and N_{2} and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with configured grant and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, corresponding to the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell, as described in Clause 9.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. If the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell corresponds to two spatial relations, the UE shall transmit the PUSCH according to the spatial relation with the lower ID. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is not configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, snischemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPLFor PUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP where all the PUCCH resource(s) are not configured with any spatial relation and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell in case CORESET(s) are configured on the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, sfnSchemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption.\n---\n- For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbols indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. - For a reduced capability half-duplex UE in paired spectrum and for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission, symbols indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. - For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbol(s) indicated by pdcch-ConfigSIBl in MIB for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. - For operation in unpaired spectrum, if numberOffnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching is configured, numberOffnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching symbol(s) after the last symbol that is indicated as downlink in each consecutive set of all symbols that are indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. The symbol(s) given by numberOflnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching are defined using the reference SCS configuration referenceSubcarrierSpacing provided in tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. - For operation with shared spectrum channel access with semi-static channel occupancy, symbols in an idle duration associated with a periodic channel occupancy as described in Clause 4.3.1.1 of [16,37.213], or in an idle duration in a period associated with an initiated channel occupancy as described in Clause 4.3.2. of [16, TS 37.213] are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. - The UE may be configured with the higher layer parameter invalidSymbolPattern, which provides a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameter symbols given by invalidSymbolPattern). A bit value equal to 1 in the symbol level bitmap symbols indicates that the corresponding symbol is an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. The UE may be additionally configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by invalidSymbolPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap symbols, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the symbol level bitmap symbols is present in the unit. The periodicityAndPattern can be \\{1,2,4,5,8,10,20 or 40 \\} units long, but maximum of 40 msec . The first symbol of periodicityAndPattern every 40 \\mathrm{msec} / \\mathrm{P} periods is a first symbol in frame n_{f} \\bmod 4=0 , where P is the duration of periodicityAndPattern-r 16 in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. If invalidSymbolPattern is configured, when the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern is determined as follows: - if the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 , or corresponds to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_1 , and if invalidSymbolPatternIndicatorDCI-0-1 is configured,\n---\nFor an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2_3 and if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB' without PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the order of the triggered SRS transmission on the serving cells follow the order of the serving cells with aperiodic SRS triggered in the DCI, and the UE in each serving cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s) from srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage set to 'antennaSwitching' and higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic'. If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on carrier c_{1} with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on carrier c_{1} and serving cell c_{2} , the UE is not expected to be configured or indicated with SRS resource(s) such that SRS transmission on carrier c_{\\text {, }} (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) would collide with the REs corresponding to the SS/PBCH blocks configured for the UE or the slots belonging to a control resource set indicated by M I B or S I B I on serving cell c_{2} . For n -th ( n >= 1 ) aperiodic SRS transmission on a cell c , upon detection of a positive SRS request on a grant, the UE shall commence this SRS transmission on the configured symbol and slot provided - it is no earlier than the summation of - the maximum time duration between the two durations spanned by N OFDM symbols of the numerology of cell c and the cell carrying the grant respectively, and - the UL or DL RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR, - it does not collide with any previous SRS transmissions, or interruption due to UL or DL RF retuning time.\n---\n8.2 Random access response - Type-1 random access procedure In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If N_{\\mathrm{TA}, \\mathrm{adj}}^{\\mathrm{UE}} or N_{\\mathrm{TA}, \\mathrm{adj}}^{\\text {common }} , as defined in [4, TS 38.211], is not zero, the window starts after an additional T_{\\mathrm{TA}}+k_{\\text {mac }} msec where T_{\\mathrm{TA}} is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and k_{\\mathrm{mac}} is provided by K -Mac or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K -Mac is not provided. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Typel-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by raResponseWindow. If the UE detects the DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers parse the transport block for a random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission. If the higher layers identify the RAPID in RAR message(s) of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an uplink grant to the physical layer. This is referred to as random access response (RAR) UL grant in the physical layer.\n---\nindicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or indicated as a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst. The UE may assume a minimum time between the last symbol of a PDSCH reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant and the first symbol of a corresponding PUSCH transmission scheduled by the RAR UL grant is equal to N_{T, 1}+N_{T, 2}+0.5 \\mathrm{msec} , where N_{T, 1} is a time duration of N_{1} symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, N_{T, 2} is a time duration of N_{2} symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] and, for determining the minimum time, the UE considers that N_{1} and N_{2} correspond to the smaller of the SCS configurations for the PDSCH and the PUSCH. For \\mu=0 , the UE assumes N_{1,0}=14[6, \\mathrm{TS} 38.214] . 8.4 PDSCH with UE contention resolution identity In response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant when a UE has not been provided a C-RNTI, the UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI scheduling a PDSCH that includes a UE contention resolution identity [11, TS 38.321]. In response to the PDSCH reception with the UE contention resolution identity, the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH. The PUCCH transmission is within a same active UL BWP as the PUSCH transmission. A minimum time between the last symbol of the PDSCH reception and the first symbol of the corresponding PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information is equal to N_{T, 1}+0.5 \\mathrm{msec} . N_{T, 1} is a time duration of N_{1} symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For \\mu=0 , the UE assumes N_{1,0}=14[6 , TS 38.214]. When detecting a DCI format in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, as described in [11, TS 38.321], or corresponding PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a TCRNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume the PDCCH carrying the DCI format has the same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format. 9 UE procedure for reporting control information\n---\nIf a UE is not provided any of pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16, or pdsch-HARQ-ACKOneShotFeedback, the UE generates at most one HARQ-ACK information bit. If the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index r_{\\text {PUCCH }}, 0 <= r_{\\text {PUCCH }} <= 15 , as r_{\\text {PUCCH }}=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2 \\cdot n_{\\text {CCE }, 0}}{N_{\\text {CCE }}}\\right\\rfloor+2 \\cdot \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} , where N_{\\text {CCE }} is a number of CCEs in a CORESET of a PDCCH reception with the DCI format, as described in clause 10.1, n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format. When the PDCCH reception by a UE includes first and second PDCCH candidates from respective first and second search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 , the CORESET and n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} are associated with the search space set having the smaller index. If - the first search space set has larger index than the second search space set and includes the first PDCCH candidate and a third PDCCH candidate that have same first CCE index and CCE aggregation levels 8 and 16, or 16 and 8, respectively, - the second search space set includes the second PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the first PDCCH candidate, and a fourth PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the third PDCCH candidate, - the CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType = 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and - the second PDCCH candidate has different first CCE index than the fourth PDCCH candidate the UE determines n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} from the PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level 16 among the second PDCCH candidate and the fourth PDCCH candidate.\n---\n\\end{array}\\right\\} \\] where N_{\\text {CCE } p} is a number of CCEs in CORESET p of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format as described in clause 10.1, n_{\\text {CCE }, p} is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format. When the PDCCH reception includes first and second PDCCH candidates from respective first and second search space sets, as described in clause 10.1, the CORESET is associated with the search space set having the smaller index. If - the first search space set has larger index than the second search space set and includes the first PDCCH candidate and a third PDCCH candidate that have same first CCE index and CCE aggregation levels 8 and 16, or 16 and 8, respectively, - the second search space set includes the second PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the first PDCCH candidate, and a fourth PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the third PDCCH candidate, - the CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType = 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and - the second PDCCH candidate has different first CCE index than the fourth PDCCH candidate the UE determines n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} from the PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level 16 among the second PDCCH candidate and the fourth PDCCH candidate.\n---\nFor each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE can be provided by higher layer signalling with - P <= 3 CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided, or if a value of coresetPoolIndex is same for all CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is provided - P <= 5 CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET For each CORESET, the UE is provided the following by ControlResourceSet: - a CORESET index p , by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetId-v1610, where - 0<p<12 if coresetPoollndex is not provided, or if a value of coresetPoollndex is same for all CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is provided; - 0<p<16 if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET; - a DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization value by pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID; - a precoder granularity for a number of REGs in the frequency domain where the UE can assume use of a same DM-RS precoder by precoderGranularity; - a number of consecutive symbols provided by duration; - a set of resource blocks provided by frequencyDomainResources; - CCE-to-REG mapping parameters provided by cce-REG-MappingType;",
