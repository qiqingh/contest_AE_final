Figure 6.1.3.44-1: Enhanced TCI States Indication for UE-specific PDCCH MAC CE\n---\nwhere the following conditions are fulfilled - they are within the resource element groups constituting the PDCCH the UE attempts to decode if the higherlayer parameter precoderGranularity equals sameAsREG-bundle, - all resource-element groups within the set of contiguous resource blocks in the CORESET where the UE attempts to decode the PDCCH if the higher-layer parameter precoderGranularity equals allContiguousRBs. The reference point for k is - subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in the CORESET if the CORESET is configured by the PBCH or by the controlResourceSetZero field in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon IE, - subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 otherwise\n---\nFor operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, a UE expects a MIB in a SS/PBCH block to provide subCarrierSpacingCommon = 'scs30or120'. Upon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if k_{S S B}<24 [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if k_{S S B}<12 for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if k_{S S B}>23 for FR1 or if k_{S S B}>11 for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon. For a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, or on an SCell if applicable as described in [10, TS 38.133], of the cell group for the serving cell.\n---\nIn the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats, and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are also referred to as broadcast DCI formats. For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceSIB1 for Type0-PDCCH CSS set by PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1. If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 . If the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency resource, and if the UE is provided searchSpaceBroadcast for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for Type3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the active DL BWP.\n---\nFor each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in clause 10.1. The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the PCell in the active DL BWP. If a UE is provided controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigSIBl or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a search space set from controlResourcesetZero as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions for the search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP. ETSI\n---\nA UE can be provided one or more G-RNTIs per serving cell for scrambling the CRC of multicast DCI formats for scheduling PDSCH receptions. The UE can be provided one or more G-CS-RNTI per serving cell for scrambling the CRC of multicast DCI formats providing activation/release for SPS PDSCH receptions. A UE can be configured by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH an MBS frequency resource for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions providing MCCH and MTCH [12, TS 38.331]; otherwise, the MBS frequency resource is same as for the CORESET with index 0 that is associated with the Type0-PDCCH CSS set for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions providing MCCH and MTCH. A UE monitors PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH receptions for MCCH or MTCH as described in clause 10.1. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon or PDSCH-ConfigCommon, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for MCCH/MTCH PDCCH receptions or PDSCH receptions, respectively, is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. A UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs for MCCH or MTCH on two serving cells. A UE in the RRC_IDLE state or in the RRC_INACTIVE state is not required to simultaneously receive on a serving cell\n---\n\\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Conditional Presence } & \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Explanation } NotS/B1-initialBWP & \\begin{tabular}{l} The field is absent in S/B1 and in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP in ServingCellConfigCommon, if SIB1 is broadcasted. Otherwise, it is optionally present, Need N. \\end{tabular} \\end{tabular} - ControlResourceSettd The ControlResourceSetld IE concerns a short identity, used to identify a control resource set within a serving cell. The ControlResourceSetld =0 identifies the ControlResourceSet\\#0 configured via PBCH (MIB) and in controlResourceSetZero (ServingCellConfigCommon). The ID space is used across the BWPs and MBS CFRs of a Serving Cell. Contro/ResourceSetid information element\n---\nThe reference point for k is - subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in the CORESET if the CORESET is configured by the PBCH or by the controlResourceSetZero field in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon IE, - subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 otherwise\n---\nIf a UE is not provided pagingSearchSpace for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If a UE is not provided peiSearchSpace for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2APDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If the UE is provided peiSearchSpace with zero value for the Type2A-PDCCH CSS set index, and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13. If a UE is provided a zero value for searchSpaceID in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or is not provided searchSpaceBroadcast, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 13, and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE monitors PDCCH ETSI\n---\ncandidates only at monitoring occasions associated with a SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block is determined by the most recent of - a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that includes a CORESET with index 0 , as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block, or - a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.\n---\n- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block. For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a PDCCH in a Typel-PDCCH CSS set is not configured with same qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties [6, TS 38.214] with a DM-RS for monitoring the PDCCH in the Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in the USS set, and if the PDCCH or an associated PDSCH overlaps in at least one symbol with a PDCCH the UE monitors in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with an associated PDSCH.\n---\n13 UE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets If during cell search a UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE determines a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from controlResourceSetZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1, as described in Tables 13-1 through 13-10, for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, or as described in Tables 13-1A and 13-4A for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or as described in Table 13-10A for FR22, and determines PDCCH monitoring occasions from searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIBI, included in MIB, as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. SFN { }_{\\mathrm{c}} and n_{\\mathrm{c}} are the SFN and slot index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and SFN \\mathrm{SSB}_{i} and n_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively, where the \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} block with index i overlaps in time with system frame \\mathrm{SFN}_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} and slot n_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} . The symbols of the CORESET associated with pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or with searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCHConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and for operation without shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that the offset in Tables 13-1 through 13-10A is defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set from the smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the smallest RB",
