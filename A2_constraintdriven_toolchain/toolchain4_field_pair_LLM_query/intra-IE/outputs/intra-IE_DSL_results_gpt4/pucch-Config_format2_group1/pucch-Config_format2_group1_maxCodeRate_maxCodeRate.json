    "evidence": "If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended. A UE is not expected to report CSI with a total number of UCI bits and CRC bits larger than 115 bits when configured with PUCCH format 4. For CSI reports transmitted on a PUCCH, if all CSI reports consist of one part, the UE may omit a portion of CSI reports. Omission of CSI is according to the priority order determined from the \\operatorname{Pri}_{1, C S 1}(y, k, c, s) value as defined in Clause 5.2.5. CSI report is omitted beginning with the lowest priority level until the CSI report code rate is less or equal to the one configured by the higher layer parameter maxCodeRate. If any of the CSI reports consist of two parts, the UE may omit a portion of Part 2 CSI. Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1. Part 2 CSI is omitted beginning with the lowest priority level until the Part 2 CSI code rate is less or equal to the one configured by higher layer parameter maxCodeRate.",
