A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, on an active DL BWP of a serving cell c , as described in clause 10.1, and for which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in slot n based on\n---\nIf a UE is scheduled a PUSCH transmission by DCI format 01 having a DAI field value V_{\\mathrm{DAI}}^{\\mathrm{UL}}=4 for a PDSCH group index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions for the PDSCH group index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH group index, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission for the PDSCH group index.

The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH. For PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell, and with ackNackFeedbackMode = joint for the active UL BWP, detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed prior to detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the second CORESETs. The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator field of 3 bits, provided by resourceList for PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used.\n---\n- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.\n---\nA SFI-index field value in a DCI format 20 indicates to a UE a slot format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 \\_0 . The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The SFI-index field includes \\max \\left\\{\\left[\\log _{2}(\\operatorname{maxSFI}\\right.\\right. inde \\left.\\left.x+1)\\right], 1\\right\\} bits where maxSFlindex is the maximum value of the values provided by corresponding slotFormatCombinationId. A slot format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where ' D ' denotes a downlink symbol, 'U' denotes an uplink symbol, and ' F ' denotes a flexible symbol. If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot. A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2 \\_0 on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.\n---\n\\end{table} If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_5 is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats 2-5 indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot. An [AB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2 _ 5 with CRC scrambled by AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets: - a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = common; - a USS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific.\n---\nFor a PSSCH transmission by a UE that is scheduled by a DCI format, or for a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission activated by a DCI format, the DCI format indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, the DCI format activating the SL configured grant Type 2 indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 1 PSSCH transmission, a PUCCH resource can be provided by sl-NIPUCCH-AN and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel. For transmission of HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, a UE can be provided a PUCCH resource by sl-NIPUCCH-AN-Type2. If a PUCCH resource is not provided, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH with generated HARQ-ACK information from PSFCH reception occasions. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources from up to four PUCCH resource sets provided by sl-PUCCH-Config, for O_{U C I} HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212] in a last DCI format 3_0, among the DCI formats 3 \\_0 that have a value of a PSFCH-toHARQ_feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as described in clause 9.2.3.\n---\nA UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information as described in clauses 9.2 and 9.2.1 through 9.2.5. If the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of same priority associated with unicast DCI formats and with multicast DCI formats in a same PUCCH, the last DCI format that the UE uses to determine the PUCCH resource, as described in clause 9.2.3, is a last unicast DCI format. If a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH first HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions and second HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast DCI formats and having same priority value as the first HARQ-ACK information, and both the first and second HARQ-ACK information are according to the first HARQACK reporting mode, the UE determines the PUCCH resource based on the last multicast DCI format, as described in clause 9.2.3.\n---\nThe field is used to indicate whether carrier indicator field is present (value true) or not (value false) in PDCCH DCI formats, see TS 38.213 [13]. If cif-Presence is set to true, the CIF value indicating a grant or assignment for this cell is 0 . cif-inSchedulingCell The field indicates the CIF value used in the scheduling cell to indicate a grant or assignment applicable for this cell, see TS 38.213 [13]. If configured for an SpCell, the nonfallback DCI formats on the SpCell include same number of CIF bits as the corresponding non-fallback DCI formats on the scheduling cell, and the CIF bits are considered reserved. enableDefaultBeamForCCS This field indicates whether default beam selection for cross-carrier scheduled PDSCH is enabled, see TS 38.214 [19]. If not present, the default beam selection behaviour is not applied, i.e. Rel-15 behaviour is applied. This field can only be configured in the cross-scheduled SCell or SpCell.\n---\nthe UE generates a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for the set S_{0} and the set S_{1} of serving cells separately by setting N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL}}=N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL} 0} and N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL}}=N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL} 1} in the following pseudo-code. The UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for the set S_{0} followed by the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for the set S_{1} to obtain a total number of O_{\\text {ACK }} HARQ-ACK information bits. If a UE is provided fdmed-Reception-Multicast and the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of unicast DCI formats and to monitor PDCCH for detection of multicast DCI formats - a serving cell is placed in a first set S_{\\mathrm{U}} of N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\text {DLU }} serving cells if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI formats 1 \\_0 / 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 for scheduling on serving cell c , and - a serving cell is placed in a second set S_{\\mathrm{M}} of N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL} \\mathrm{M}} serving cells if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 4_1/4_2 for scheduling on serving cell c , and\n---\nThe value of the total DAI, when present [5, TS 38.212], in a DCI format denotes the total number of serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion\\}-pair(s) in which PDSCH reception(s), or HARQ-ACK information that does not correspond to PDSCH receptions, associated with DCI formats, excluding the SPS activation DCI, is present, up to the current PDCCH monitoring occasion m and is updated from PDCCH monitoring occasion to PDCCH monitoring occasion. If, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided ackNackFeedbackMode = joint, the total DAI value counts the \\{serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion\\}-pair(s) for both the first CORESETs and the second CORESETs. Denote by N_{C-\\mathrm{DAl}}^{\\mathrm{DL}} the number of bits for the counter DAl and set T_{D}=2^{N_{C-\\mathrm{DAl}}^{\\mathrm{DL}}} . Denote by V_{\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{DAl}, c, m}^{\\mathrm{DL}} the value of the counter DAI in a DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, on serving cell c in PDCCH monitoring occasion m according to Table 9.1.3-1 or Table 9.1.3-1A. Denote by V_{\\mathrm{T}-\\mathrm{DAl}, m}^{\\mathrm{DL}} the value of the total DAI in a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion m according to Table 9.1.3-1. The UE assumes a same value of total DAI in all DCI formats that include a total DAI field in PDCCH monitoring occasion m . A UE does not expect to multiplex, in a same Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook, HARQ-ACK information that is in response to detection of DCI formats with different number of bits for the counter DAI field. If the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot n and for any PUCCH format, the UE determines the \\tilde{o}_{0}^{A C K}, \\tilde{o}_{1}^{A C K}, \\cdots, \\tilde{o}_{O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}-1}^{A C K} , for a total number of O_{\\mathrm{ACK}} HARQ-ACK information bits, according to the following pseudocode:",
