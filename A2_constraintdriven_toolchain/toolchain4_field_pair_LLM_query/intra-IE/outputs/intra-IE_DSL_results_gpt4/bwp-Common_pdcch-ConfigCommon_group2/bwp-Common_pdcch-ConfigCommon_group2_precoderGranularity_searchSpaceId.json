When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH.",
