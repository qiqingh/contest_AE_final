Candidate slots in which the configured SRS resource may be used for SRS transmission are the slots satisfying\n---\n- the UE is not expected to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks. - the periodicity and slot offset for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, as given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211].\n---\n- the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of 2^{\\mu} X_{p} slots where X_{F}=10,20,40 , or 80 and where \\mu is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet. - the UE does not expect the TRS-ResourceSet to be configured with the periodicity of 2^{\\mu} \\times 10 slots if the band width of NZP CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks.\n---\n- Time domain behaviour of SRS resource configuration as indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType, which may be periodic, semi-persistent, aperiodic SRS transmission as defined in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher layer parameters periodicityAndOffset- p or periodicityAndOffset-sp for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource set SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet with different slot level periodicities. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a list of zero up to four different available slot offset values from the reference slot n+k to the slot where the aperiodic SRS resource set is transmitted where n is the slot with triggering DCI and k is SlotOffset is defined by the higher layer parameter AvailableSlotOffset. The parameter AvailableSlotOffset can be configured up to 4 different values. For an SRSPosResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', the slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset for each SRS resource.\n---\nperiodicityAndOffset This field specifies the periodicity of DL-PRS allocation in slots and the slot offset with respect to SFN \\#0 slot \\#0 in the PCell where the DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set is configured (i.e., slot where the first DL-PRS Resource of DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set occurs).\n---\nThis field specifies the offset in units of slots between two repeated instances of a DL-PRS Resource corresponding to the same DL-PRS Resource ID within a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. The time duration spanned by one DL-PRS Resource Set containing repeated DL-PRS Resources should not exceed the periodicity configured by periodicityAndOffset. The field is mandatory present, if repetitionFactor is present. Otherwise, it is not present.\n---\nperiodicityAndOffset-p Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in \"number of slots\". Value sil corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sil2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sli the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
