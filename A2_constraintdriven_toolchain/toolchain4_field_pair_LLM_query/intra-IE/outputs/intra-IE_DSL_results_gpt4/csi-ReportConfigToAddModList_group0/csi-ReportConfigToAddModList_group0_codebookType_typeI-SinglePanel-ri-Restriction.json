A CSI-ReportConfig with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs can be configured with wideband frequency granularity only with csi-ReportMode set to 'Mode1' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model set to X=0 . For type I CSI sub-band reporting on PUCCH formats 3, or 4, the payload is split into two parts. The first part contains RI (if reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword. The second part contains PMI (if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second codeword (if reported) when RI >4 . For a CSI-ReportConfig configured with subband reporting, codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, Part 1 contains RI(s), CRI(s), CQI(s) for the first codeword and is zero padded to a fixed payload size (if needed). Part 2 contains the CQI(s) for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4, Lis (if reported) and PMI(s).\n---\ncorresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or\n---\ncorresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5-4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or",
