    "evidence": "If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'none' and if the CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) contains a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet that is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition and without the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE can only be configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer parameter nrofPorts for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block.\n---\nA UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-CQI', - if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, r ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank r and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \\ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \\ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} of port indices, where p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank v and R \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, P\\} where P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks.",
