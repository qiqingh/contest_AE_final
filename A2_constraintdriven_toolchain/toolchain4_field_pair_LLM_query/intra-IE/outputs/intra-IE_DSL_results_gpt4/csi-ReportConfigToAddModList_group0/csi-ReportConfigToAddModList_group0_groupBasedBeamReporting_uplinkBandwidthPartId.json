For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.",
