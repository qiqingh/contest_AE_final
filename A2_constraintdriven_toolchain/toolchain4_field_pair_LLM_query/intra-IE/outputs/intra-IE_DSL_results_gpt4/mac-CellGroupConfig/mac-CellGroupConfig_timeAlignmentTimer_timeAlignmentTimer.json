The RA accesses associated to Initial access from RRC_IDLE, RRC re-establishment procedure, transition from RRC-INACTIVE. The indicator beamFailureRecovery is used in case of successful beam failure recovery related RA procedure in the SpCell [3]. The indicator reconfigurationWithSync is used if the UE executes a reconfiguration with sync. The indicator ulUnSynchronized is used if the random access procedure is initiated in a SpCell by DL or UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED when the timeAlignmentTimer is not running in the PTAG or if the RA procedure is initiated in a serving cell by a PDCCH order [3]. The indicator schedulingRequestFailure is used in case of SR failures [3]. The indicator noPUCCHResourceAvailable is used when the UE has no valid SR PUCCH resources configured [3]. The indicator requestForOtherS/is used for MSG1 based on demand SI request. The indicator msg3RequestForOtherS/is used in case of MSG3 based SI request. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l}\n---\n1> when the indication is received from upper layer for stopping the inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer: 2> stop the inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer. 1> when the indication is received from upper layer for starting the inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer: 2> start or restart the inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer. 1> when instruction from the upper layer has been received for starting the cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer:\n---\n1> when a timeAlignmentTimer expires: 2> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a PTAG and the SpCell is not configured with two PTAGs; or 2> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a PTAG, the SpCell is configured with two PTAGs, and the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other PTAG is not running: 3> flush all HARQ buffers for all Serving Cells;\n---\n2> else: 3> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for an SCell configured with only this TAG; or 3> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for an SCell, and if the SCell is configured with two TAGs and the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other TAG is not running: 4> flush all HARQ buffers for all such SCells;\n---\n4> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting for all such SCells; 4> maintain \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{TA}} (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of this TAG. 3> else if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for a Serving Cell configured with two TAGs, and if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other TAG is running, for all such Serving Cells: 4> clear any configured downlink assignment, if the activated TCI state(s) for all PUCCH resources configured for the configured downlink assignment is associated with the TAG of the expired timeAlignmentTimer; 4> clear any configured uplink grant, if the activated TCI state(s) for the configured uplink grant is associated with the TAG of the expired timeAlignmentTimer;\n---\n2> flush all HARQ buffers; 2> maintain \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{TA}} (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of this TAG.
