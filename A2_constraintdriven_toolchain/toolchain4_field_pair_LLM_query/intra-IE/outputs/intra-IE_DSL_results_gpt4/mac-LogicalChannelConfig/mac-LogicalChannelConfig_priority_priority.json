NOTE 1: If multiple Destinations have the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same highest priority or if multiple Destinations have either the MAC CE and/or the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same priority as the MAC CE, which Destination is selected among them is up to UE implementation.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook of the same priority. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol i is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than N symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of N depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\mu with N=13 for \\mu=0, N=13 for \\mu=1, N=20 for \\mu=2, N=24 for \\mu=3, N=96 for \\mu=5 , and N=192 for \\mu=6 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.\n---\nIf the UE is configured with DL-PRS-QCL-Info and the QCL relation is between two DL PRS resources, then the UE assumes those DL PRS resources are associated with the same d l -PRS-ID. If DL-PRS-QCL-Info is configured to the UE with QCL set to 'type-D' with a source DL PRS resource then the nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSetId and the nr-DL-PRSResourceld of the source DL PRS resource are expected to be indicated to the UE. The UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap, subject to UE capability, if the DL PRS is inside the active DL BWP and has the same numerology as the active DL BWP and is within the DL PRS processing window indicated by higher layer parameter [PRSProcessing Window]. For receiving the DL PRS outside the measurement gap and within the DL PRS processing window, if the UE determines the DL PRS priority is higher than [other DL signals or channels except SSB] as indicated by higher layer parameter [PRS-priority-indicator] or as implied by UE capability, the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS; otherwise, the UE is not expected to measure the DL PRS and expected to receive [other DL signals and channels], subject to UE capabilities. Inside one instance of the [PRSProcessingWindow] the UE is only expected to measure a single DL PRS positioning frequency layer. When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-1A] and if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels are not expected to be measured by the UE. When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-1B] and if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels in the same band as the DL PRS are not expected to be measured by the UE. When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-2] if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels from the impacted serving cells are not expected to be measured by the UE on the overlapped symbols with the DL PRS, where impacted serving cells refer to the serving cell on which the [PRSProcessingWindow] is configured for a frequency range 1 band, and all the serving cells in the same band as the DL PRS for a frequency range 2 band.\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) When CSI reporting on PUSCH comprises two parts, the UE may omit a portion of the Part 2 CSI. Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1, where N_{\\text {Rep }} is the number of CSI reports configured to be carried on the PUSCH. Priority 0 is the highest priority and priority 2 N_{\\text {Rep }} is the lowest priority and the CSI report n corresponds to the CSI report with the n th smallest \\operatorname{Pri}_{1, C S I}(y, k, c, s) value among the N_{\\text {Rep }} CSI reports as defined in Clause 5.2.5. The subbands for a given CSI report n indicated by the higher layer parameter csi-ReportingBand are numbered continuously in increasing order with the lowest subband of csi-ReportingBand as subband 0 . When omitting Part 2 CSI information for a particular priority level, the UE shall omit all of the information at that priority level. - For Enhanced Type [I reports, for a given CSI report n , each reported element of indices i_{2,4, l} i_{2,5, l} and i_{1,7, l} , indexed by l, i and f , is associated with a priority value \\operatorname{Pri}(l, i, f)=2 \\cdot L \\cdot v \\cdot \\pi(f)+v \\cdot i+l , with \\pi(f)= \\min \\left(2 \\cdot n_{3, l}^{(f)}, 2 \\cdot\\left(N_{3}-n_{3, l}^{(f)}\\right)-1\\right) with l=1,2, \\ldots, v, i=0,1, \\ldots, 2 L-1 , and f=0,1, \\ldots, M_{v}-1 , and where n_{3, l}^{(f)} is defined in Clause 5.2.2.2.5. The element with the highest priority has the lowest associated value Pri(l, i, f) . Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1, where - Group 0 includes indices i_{1,1} (if reported), i_{1,2} (if reported) and i_{1,8, l}(l=1, \\ldots, v) .\n---\nIf the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended. A UE is not expected to report CSI with a total number of UCI bits and CRC bits larger than 115 bits when configured with PUCCH format 4. For CSI reports transmitted on a PUCCH, if all CSI reports consist of one part, the UE may omit a portion of CSI reports. Omission of CSI is according to the priority order determined from the \\operatorname{Pri}_{1, C S 1}(y, k, c, s) value as defined in Clause 5.2.5. CSI report is omitted beginning with the lowest priority level until the CSI report code rate is less or equal to the one configured by the higher layer parameter maxCodeRate. If any of the CSI reports consist of two parts, the UE may omit a portion of Part 2 CSI. Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1. Part 2 CSI is omitted beginning with the lowest priority level until the Part 2 CSI code rate is less or equal to the one configured by higher layer parameter maxCodeRate.\n---\n- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the first uplink symbol which carries the HARQ-ACK information further includes the effect of timing difference between the component carriers as given in [11, TS 38.133]. - For the PDSCH mapping type A as given in clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211]: if the last symbol of PDSCH is on the i -th symbol of the slot where i<7 , then d_{l, l}=7-i , otherwise d_{l, l}=0 - If a PUCCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH/PUSCH of a smaller priority index, d_{2} for the PUCCH of a larger priority is set as reported by the UE; otherwise d_{2}=0 . ETSI\n---\nIf a PUSCH with a priority index 0 and SRS configured by SRS-Resource are transmitted in the same slot on a serving cell, the UE may only be configured to transmit SRS after the transmission of the PUSCH and the corresponding DMRS. If a PUSCH transmission with a priority index 1 or a PUCCH transmission with a priority index 1 would overlap in time with an SRS transmission on a serving cell, the UE does not transmit the SRS in the overlapping symbol(s). For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'periodic':\n---\nFor the inter-set guard period, the UE does not transmit any other signal on any symbols of the interval if the interval between SRS resource sets is Y symbols. - When both the SRS resource on all of the corresponding symbols prior to the gap and the SRS resource on all of the corresponding symbols after the gap are dropped due to collision handling, the gap period is also dropped with same priority and can be used for UL transmission. The UE shall expect to be configured with the same number of SRS ports for all SRS resources in the SRS resource set(s) with higher layer parameter usage set as 'antennaSwitching'.\n---\n- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation further includes the effect of timing difference between component carriers as given in [11, TS 38.133]. - If the scheduling DCI triggered a switch of \\mathrm{BWP}, d_{2,2} equals to the switching time as defined in [11, TS 38.133], otherwise d_{2,2}=0 . - If a PUSCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH of a smaller priority index, d_{2} for the PUSCH of a larger priority is set as reported by the UE; otherwise d_{2}=0 . - For a UE that supports capability 2 on a given cell, the processing time according to UE processing capability 2 is applied if the high layer parameter processingType2Enabled in PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is configured for the cell and set to 'enable', - If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with one or more PUCCH channels, then the transport block is multiplexed following the procedure in clause 9.2 .5 of [6, TS 38.213], otherwise the transport block is transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by the DCI.\n---\nThe following higher layer parameters affect this procedure: - sl-SelectionWindowList: internal parameter T_{2 m i n} is set to the corresponding value from higher layer parameter sl-SelectionWindowList for the given value of prio { }_{T X} - - sl-Thres-RSRP-List: this higher layer parameter provides an RSRP threshold for each combination \\left(p_{i}, p_{j}\\right) , where p_{i} is the value of the priority field in a received S C I format 1-A and p_{\\mathrm{j}} is the priority of the transmission of the UE selecting resources; for a given invocation of this procedure, p_{\\mathrm{j}}=\\operatorname{prio}_{T X} - - sl-RS-ForSensing selects if the UE uses the PSSCH-RSRP or PSCCH-RSRP measurement, as defined in clause 8.4.2.1 - sl-ResourceReservePeriodList\n---\n8.1.6 Sidelink congestion control in sidelink resource allocation mode 2 If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter sl-CR-Limit and transmits PSSCH in slot n , the UE shall ensure the following limits for any priority value k ; \\[ \\sum_{i \\geq k} C R(i) \\leq C R_{\\text {Limit }}(k)\n---\n- SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than semi-persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other than the PCell In case of same priority order and for operation with carrier aggregation, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the primary cell of the MCG or the SCG over transmissions on a secondary cell. In case of same priority order and for operation with two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the carrier where the UE is configured to transmit PUCCH. If PUCCH is not configured for any of the two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the non-supplementary UL carrier. 7.6 Dual connectivity 7.6.1 EN-DC",
