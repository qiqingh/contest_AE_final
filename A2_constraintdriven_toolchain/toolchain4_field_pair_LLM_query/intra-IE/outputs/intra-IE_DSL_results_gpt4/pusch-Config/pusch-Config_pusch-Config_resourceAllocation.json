    "evidence": "If pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH in pusch-Config contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous PUSCHs, K_{2} indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and mapping type. The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated valid SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH signalled in DCI format 0 \\_1 .\n---\nIf the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 0 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format 0 \\_1 or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format 0 \\_2 . The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_1 and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\nIn uplink resource allocation of type 0 , the resource block assignment information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups (RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter rbg-Size configured in pusch-Config and the size of the bandwidth part as defined in Table 6.1.2.2.1-1.\n---\n- For PUSCH repetition type B, the selection of the time domain resource allocation table is as follows: - If pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is configured and set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is used;\n---\n- It is not expected that pusch-RepTypeIndicator in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant is configured with 'puschRepTypeB' when none of pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 and pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'pusch-RepTypeB'. - The higher layer parameter timeDomainAllocation value m provides a row index m+1 pointing to the determined time domain resource allocation table, where the start symbol and length are determined following the procedure defined in Clause 6.1.2.1;\n---\nFor a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or by DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TCRNTI, frequency offsets are obtained as described in clause 8.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. Otherwise, for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 and for resource allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_2 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config.\n---\nFor a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_1 and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config.
