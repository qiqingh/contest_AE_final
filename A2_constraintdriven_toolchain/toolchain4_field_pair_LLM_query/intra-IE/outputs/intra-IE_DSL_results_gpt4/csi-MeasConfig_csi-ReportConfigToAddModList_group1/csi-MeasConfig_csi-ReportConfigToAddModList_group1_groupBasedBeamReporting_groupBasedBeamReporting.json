    "evidence": "Each CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S \\geq 1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior. The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement:\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive filters.\n---\n71 ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 , the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance nrofReportedRSgroup, if configured, group(s) of two CRIs or SSBRIs selecting one CSI-RS or SSB from each of the two CSI Resource Sets for the report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources of each group can be received simultaneously by the UE. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set][ndex',\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set][ndex', - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE.\n---\n- the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting up to 16 CSI-RS resource sets having up to 64 resources within each set. The total number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more than 128. For L1-RSRP reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-RSRP value is defined by a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-RSRP is quantized to a 7 -bit value in the range [-140,-44] \\mathrm{dBm} with 1 dB step size, and the differential L 1 -RSRP is quantized to ETSI\n---\na 4-bit value. The differential L1-RSRP value is computed with 2 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-RSRP value which is part of the same L1-RSRP reporting instance. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the measured quantity is described in [11, TS 38.133]. When the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r I 7in CSI-ReportConfig is configured, the UE shall indicate the CSI Resource Set associated with the largest measured value of L1-RSRP, and for each group, CRI or SSBRI of the indicated CSI Resource Set is present first. If the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements in CSI-ReportConfig is set to \"notConfigured\", the UE shall derive the channel measurements for computing L1-RSRP value reported in uplink slot n based on only the SS/PBCH or NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI reference resource, (defined in TS 38.211[4]) associated with the CSI resource setting.\n---\n- for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64 CSI -RS resources or up to 64 \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} Block resources. For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value is defined by a 7-bit value in the range [-23,40] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', the UE shall use differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range [ -23,40 ] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a 4 -bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset. When one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement",
