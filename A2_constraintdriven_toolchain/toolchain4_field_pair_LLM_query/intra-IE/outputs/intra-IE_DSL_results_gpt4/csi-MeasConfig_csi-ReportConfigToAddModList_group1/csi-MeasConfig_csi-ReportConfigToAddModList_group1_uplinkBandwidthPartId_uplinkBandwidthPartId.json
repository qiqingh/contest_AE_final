If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r I 7 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, when any two DL DCIs end in the same symbol and at least one of the DCIs schedules multiple PDSCHs, the UE does not expect that the scheduled PDSCH(s) by the two DCIs have overlapping spans, where the span associated with a DCI is defined from the beginning of the first scheduled PDSCH or up to the end of the last scheduled PDSCH.\n---\nresourceAllocationDCI-1-2 for DCI format 1 _2 or by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast for DCI format 4_2. If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1 \\_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 , the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.\n---\n\\] where L_{R B s} \\geq 1 and shall not exceed N_{B W P}^{s i z e}-R B_{\\text {start }} .

The RateMatchPattern(s) configured for MBS broadcast is counted into the ones that are configured per serving-cell. A RateMatchPattern may contain: - within a BWP, when provided by PDSCH-Config or within a serving cell when provided by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon, or by PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MTCH, a pair of reserved resources with numerology provided by higher layer parameter subcarrierSpacing given by RateMatchPattern when configured per serving cell or by numerology of associated BWP when configured per BWP. The pair of reserved resources are respectively indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter resourceBlocks given by RateMatchPattern) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters symbolsInResourceBlock given by RateMatchPattern) for which the reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for PDSCH . For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by RateMatchPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair is present in the unit. The periodicityAndPattern can be \\{1,2,4,5,8,10,20 or 40 \\} units long, but maximum of 40 msec .

The REs indicated by p -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are declared as not available for PDSCH. The REs indicated by sp-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList and aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList are declared as not available for PDSCH when their triggering and activation are applied, respectively. The following parameters are configured via higher layer signaling for each ZP CSI-RS resource configuration: - zp-CSI-RS-Resourceld in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource determines ZP CSI-RS resource configuration identity. - nrofPorts in CSI-RS-ResourceMapping defines the number of CSI-RS ports, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211].",
