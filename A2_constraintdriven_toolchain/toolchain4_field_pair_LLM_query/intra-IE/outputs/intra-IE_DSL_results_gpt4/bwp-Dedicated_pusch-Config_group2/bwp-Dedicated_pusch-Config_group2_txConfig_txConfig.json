When the higher-layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the precoding matrix W=1 . \\begin{table}\n---\nThe UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. ETSI\n---\n6.1.1 Transmission schemes Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode. 6.1.1.1 Codebook based UL transmission\n---\nconfigured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook'. When only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3. The TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3-1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The indicated SRI in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', one or two SRI(s), and one or two TPMI(s) are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicator and two Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2.

For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.\n---\nWhen only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used.\n---\n7.1 Physical uplink shared channel For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP b , as described in clause 12 , of carrier f of serving cell c , a UE first calculates a linear value \\hat{P}_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) of the transmit power P_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) , with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1.
