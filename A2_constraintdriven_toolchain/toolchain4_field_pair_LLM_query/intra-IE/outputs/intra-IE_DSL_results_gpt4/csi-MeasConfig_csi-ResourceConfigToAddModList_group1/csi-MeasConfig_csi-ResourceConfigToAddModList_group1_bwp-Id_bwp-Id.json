When the bwp-id or cell for QCL-TypeA/D source RS in a QCL-Info of the TCI state configured with DLorJointTCIState is not configured, the UE assumes that QCL-TypeA/D source RS is configured in the CC/DL BWP where TCI state applies. When tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, the UE with activated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState receives DCI format 1_1/1_2 providing indicated DLorJointTCIState or ULTCIState for a CC or all CCs in the same CC list configured by simultaneous TCI-UpdateListl-r 17, simultaneous TCI-UpdateList2-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList3-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList4-r17. The DCI format 1_1/1_2 can be with or without, if applicable, DL assignment. If the DCI format 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 / is without DL assignment, the UE can assume the following:\n---\nEach CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S \\geq 1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP. The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior. The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement:\n---\nFor a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'semi-persistent': - when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on SRS transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }}{ }^{\\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet, each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, each [D in the list of reference signal [Ds may refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell indicated by PCI field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a d l- PRS-ID indicated by DL-PRS ID field in the activation command. - if an SRS resource in the activated resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, the UE shall assume that the ID of the reference signal in the activation command overrides the one configured in spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos.\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} defauitDownlinkBWP-id The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id =0 . ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon expiry of the BWP inactivity timer. This field is UE specific. When the field is absent the UE uses the initial BWP as default BWP.
