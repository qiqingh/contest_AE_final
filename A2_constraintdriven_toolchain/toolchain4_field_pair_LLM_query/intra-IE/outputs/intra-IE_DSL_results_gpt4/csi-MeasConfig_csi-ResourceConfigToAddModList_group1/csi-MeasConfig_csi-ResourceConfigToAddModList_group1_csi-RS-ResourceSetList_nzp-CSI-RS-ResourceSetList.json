If the CORESET is activated with two TCI states, UE may assume that the first TCI state of the CORESET as the default QCL assumption for the CSI-RS.

The length of the field is 6 bits;\n---\nFor CSI-RS resource sets associated with Resource Settings configured with the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', 'periodic', or 'semi-persistent', trigger states for Reporting Setting(s) (configured with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'aperiodic') and/or Resource Setting for channel and/or interference measurement on one or more component carriers are configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList. For aperiodic CSI report triggering, a single set of CSI triggering states are higher layer configured, wherein the CSI triggering states can be associated with any candidate DL BWP. A UE is not expected to receive more than one DCI with non-zero CSI request field per slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive DCI with non-zero CSI request field within a cell group in a slot overlapping with any slot receiving DCI with non-zero CSI request field in the same cell group. A UE is not expected to be configured with different TCI-Stateld's for the same aperiodic CSI-RS resource ID configured in multiple aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets with the same triggering offset in the same aperiodic trigger state. A UE is not expected to receive more than one aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a given slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveB WP the UE is not expected to be triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP. Otherwise, when a UE is triggered with a CSI report for a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the most recent occasion, no later than the CSI reference resource, of the associated NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected to report the CSI for the non-active DL BWP and the CSI report associated with that BWP is omitted. When a UE is triggered with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS in a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the NZP CSIRS, the UE is not expected to measure the aperiodic CSI-RS. In the carrier of the serving cell expecting to receive that associated NZP CSI-RS, if the active DL BWP when receiving the NZP CSI-RS is different from the active DL BWP when receiving the triggering DCI ,\n---\nIn any slot, the UE is not expected to have more active CSI-RS ports or active CSI-RS resources in active BWPs than reported as capability. NZP CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used. For semi-persistent CSI-RS, starting from the end of when the activation command is applied, and ending at the end of when the deactivation command is applied. For periodic CSI-RS, starting when the periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layer signalling, and ending when the periodic CSI-RS configuration is released. If a CSI-RS resource is referred N times by one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted N times. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, if a CSIRS resource is referred X times by one of the M CSI-RS resources, where M is defined in clause 5.2.1.4.2, and/or one or two Resource Pairs, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted X times.\n---\nThe following parameters for which the UE shall assume non-zero transmission power for CSI-RS resource are configured via the higher layer parameter NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, CSI-ResourceConfig and NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for each CSI-RS resource configuration:\n---\nWhen deriving CSI feedback, the UE is not expected that a NZP CSI -RS resource for channel measurement overlaps with CSI-IM resource for interference measurement or NZP CSI -RS resource for interference measurement.\n---\nwhere Z_{\\text {ref }} is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting T_{\\text {wo.CE }}=(Z)(2048+144) \\cdot K 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{c}}+T_{\\text {meach }} after the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the CSI report(s), and where Z_{\\text {ref }}(n) , is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting T^{\\dagger}{ }_{\\sigma \\alpha \\cdot C V}=\\left(Z^{\\prime}\\right)(2048+144) \\cdot K 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{c}} after the end of the last symbol in time of the latest of: aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for the n -th triggered CSI report, and where T_{\\text {switch }} is defined in clause 6.4 and is applied only if Z_{1} of table 5.4-1 is applied.\n---\nZero-power (ZP) and non-zero-power (NZP) CSI-RS are defined - for a non-zero-power CSI-RS configured by the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or by the CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility field in the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility [E or by the TRS-ResourceSet [E, the sequence shall be generated according to clause 7.4.1.5.2 and mapped to resource elements according to clause 7.4.1.5.3\n---\nThe UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and DM-RS on the same resource elements.
