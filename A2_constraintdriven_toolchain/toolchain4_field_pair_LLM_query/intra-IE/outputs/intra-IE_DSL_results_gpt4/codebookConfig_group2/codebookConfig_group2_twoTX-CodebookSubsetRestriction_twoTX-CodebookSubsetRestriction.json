The UE is configured with the higher layer parameter twoTX-CodebookSubsetRestriction. The bitmap parameter twoTX-CodebookSubsetRestriction forms the bit sequence a_{5}, \\ldots, a_{1}, a_{0} where a_{0} is the LSB and a_{5} is the MSB and where a bit value of zero indicates that PMI reporting is not allowed to correspond to the precoder associated with the bit. Bits 0 to 3 are associated respectively with the codebook indices 0 to 3 for v=1 layer, and bits 4 and 5 are associated respectively with the codebook indices 0 and 1 for v=2 layers. \\begin{table}",
