If the UE is not provided searchSpaceGroupIdList for a search space set, the following procedures are not applicable for PDOCH monitoring according to the search space set. If a UE is provided cellGroupsForSwitchList, indicating one or more groups of serving cells, the following procedures apply to all serving cells within each group; otherwise, the following procedures apply only to a serving cell for which the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList.\n---\nPoint A serves as a common reference point for resource block grids and is obtained from: - offsetToPointA for a PCell downlink where offsetToPointA represents the frequency offset between point A and the lowest subcarrier of the lowest resource block, which overlaps with the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, used by the UE for initial cell selection, expressed in units of resource blocks assuming 15 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR1 and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR2; - for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon; - for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 or FR2, and for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing same as the SS/PBCH block used by the UE for initial cell selection;\n---\n\\] In case of cyclic prefix extension of the first OFDM symbol l allocated for PUSCH, SRS, PUCCH, PSCCH/PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SS/PSBCH block transmission, the time-continuous signal s_{\\text {ext }}^{(p, \\mu)}(t) for the interval t_{\\text {start }, l}^{\\mu}-T_{\\text {ext }} \\leq t< t_{\\text {start }, l}^{\\mu} preceding the first OFDM symbol for PUSCH, SRS, PUCCH, PSCCH/PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SS/PSBCH block is given by \\[ s_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{(p, \\mu)}(t)=\\bar{s}_{l}^{(p, \\mu)}(t)\n---\nThe UE shall assume the virtual resource blocks are mapped to physical resource blocks according to the indicated mapping scheme, non-interleaved or interleaved mapping. If no mapping scheme is indicated, the UE shall assume noninterleaved mapping. For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n , except for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format 1 \\_0 in a common search space in which case virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n+N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {COREST }} where N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} is the lowest-numbered physical resource block in the control resource set where the corresponding DCI was received. When two PDCCH candidates from two linked common search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked common search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} .

NOTE 3: If an (e)RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE mode is configured with a BWP indicated by initial DownlinkB WP-RedCap which is not associated with any SSB, SS-RSRP measurement is performed based on the SSB associated with the BWP indicated by initia/DownlinkBWP. If an (e)RedCap UE in RRC_INACTIVE mode is configured with SDT and with a BWP indicated by initialDownlinkBWPRedCap which is associated with NCD-SSB, SS-RSRP measurement can also be performed based on this NCD-SSB during SDT.
