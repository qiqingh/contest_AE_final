If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- if shared C M R is configured: M_{1}=K_{1} and M_{2}=K_{2} ; otherwise - if sharedCMR is not configured, only the resources in Group 1 and Group 2 that are not referred to in any Resource Pair are associated to M CRI values other than the N CRIs defined above. - If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, M+N resources are configured in the corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet. The M resources for channel measurement defined above are resource-wise associated with the first M CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources in the corresponding Resource Set.
