    "evidence": "The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. ETSI\n---\n6.1.1 Transmission schemes Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode. 6.1.1.1 Codebook based UL transmission\n---\nWhen the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used. For codebook based transmission, the UE determines its codebook subsets based on TPMI(s) and upon the reception of higher layer parameter codebookSubset in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 0 \\_1 and codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 02 which may be configured with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent', or 'partialAndNonCoherent', or 'nonCoherent' depending on the UE capability. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2' and the higher layer parameter codebookSubset or the higher layer parameter codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 is set to 'partialAndNonCoherent', and when the SRS-resourceSet with usage set to \"codebook\" includes at least one SRS resource with 4 ports and one SRS resource with 2 ports, the codebookSubset associated with the 2 -port SRS resource is 'nonCoherent'. The maximum transmission rank may be configured by the higher layer parameter maxRank in pusch-Config for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_1 and maxRankDCI-0-2 for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_2. A UE reporting its UE capability of 'partialAndNonCoherent' transmission shall not expect to be configured by either codebookSubset or codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent'.\n---\n- if a DCI format 0 \\_1 or DCI format 0 \\_2 indicates codepoint \" 10 \" for the SRS resource set indicator, the first and second SRS resource set association to K consecutive slots is determined as follows: - When K=2 , the first and second SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of 2 consecutive slots, respectively. - When K > 2 and cyclicMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the first and second SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, respectively, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of K consecutive slots. - When K > 2 and sequentialMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, first SRS resource set is applied to the first and second slots of K consecutive slots, and the second SRS resource set is applied to the third and fourth slot of K consecutive slots, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of K consecutive slots. - Otherwise, a DCI format 0 \\_1 or DCI format 0 \\_2 indicates codepoint \"11\" for the SRS resource set indicator, and the first and second SRS resource set association to K consecutive slots is determined as follows,\n---\nThe UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is determined according to clause 8.3 of [6,38.213] or a MsgA PUSCH transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined according to clause 8.1A of [6,38.213]. Three uplink resource allocation schemes type 0 , type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 0 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format 0 \\_1 or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format 0 \\_2 . The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_1 and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_0 , then uplink resource allocation type 1 is used, except when any of the higher layer parameters useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWPUplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured in which case uplink resource allocation type 2 is used.\n---\n- For PUSCH repetition type A, the selection of the time domain resource allocation table follows the rules for DCI format 0 \\_0 on UE specific search space, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. - For PUSCH repetition type B, the selection of the time domain resource allocation table is as follows: - If pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is configured and set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is used; - Otherwise, pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is used. - It is not expected that pusch-RepTypeIndicator in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant is configured with 'puschRepTypeB' when none of pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 and pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'pusch-RepTypeB'.\n---\n- If the DCI with the scheduling grant was received with DCI format 0 \\_0 , the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or disabled according to the higher layer configured parameter msg3-transformPrecoder. - If the DCI with the scheduling grant was not received with DCI format 0 \\_0 - If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter transformPrecoder in pusch-Config, the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or disabled according to this parameter. ETSI\n---\nfor a PUSCH with configured grant using CS-RNTI, and if transform precoding is disabled for this PUSCH transmission according to Clause 6.1.3 - if mcs-TableDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'qam256', and PUSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 0 \\_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI, - the UE shall use I_{M C S} and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( Q_{m} ) and Target code rate ( R ) used in the physical uplink shared channel; - elseif the UE is not configured with MCS-C-RNTI, mcs-TableDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'qam64LowSE', and the PUSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH by a PDCCH with DCI format 02 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI,\n---\n6.3.1 Frequency hopping for PUSCH repetition Type A and for TB processing over multiple slots For PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 and for TB processing over multiple slots (as determined according to procedures defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2 in puschConfig for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_2 , and by frequencyHopping provided in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than 0 \\_2 , and by frequencyHopping provided in configured GrantConfig for configured PUSCH transmission. For PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by RAR UL grant or by DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the frequency hopping flag information field of the RAR UL grant, and by the frequency hopping flag information field of DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, respectively. One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured: - Intra-slot frequency hopping, applicable to single slot and multi-slot configured PUSCH transmission, multi-slot PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , each of multiple PUSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI if the higher layer parameter pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH is configured and each of multiple configured grant PUSCH transmissions in a configuration where the higher layer parameters cgnrofSlots and cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot are provided.\n---\n6.3.2 Frequency hopping for PUSCH repetition Type B For PUSCH repetition Type B (as determined according to procedures defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_2 , by frequencyHoppingDCI-0-1 provided in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 , and by frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB provided in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant for Type 1 configured PUSCH transmission. The frequency hopping mode for Type 2 configured PUSCH transmission follows the configuration of the activating DCI format. One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured: - Inter-repetition frequency hopping - Inter-slot frequency hopping\n---\n7.1 Physical uplink shared channel For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP b , as described in clause 12 , of carrier f of serving cell c , a UE first calculates a linear value \\hat{P}_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) of the transmit power P_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) , with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1. For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than DCI format 0 \\_0 , or configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, if txConfig in PUSCH-Config is set to 'codebook', - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is provided, the UE scales \\hat{P}_{\\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) by s where: - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerModel, and each SRS resource in the SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, s is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource\n---\nwhere \\tilde{P}_{\\mathrm{CMAX}, f_{,} c}(i) is computed assuming \\mathrm{MPR}=0 \\mathrm{~dB}, \\mathrm{~A}-\\mathrm{MPR}=0 \\mathrm{~dB}, \\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{MPR}=0 \\mathrm{~dB} . \\triangle \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{C}}=0 \\mathrm{~dB} . MPR, A-MPR, PMPR and \\Delta \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{C}} are defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3]. The remaining parameters are defined in clause 7.1.1 where P_{0 \\_ \\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) and \\alpha_{b_{1}, c, c}(j) are obtained using P_{0 \\_ \\text {NOMINAL }, \\text { PUSCH }, f, c}(0) and p 0 -PUSCH-AlphaSetld =0, P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) is obtained using pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id =0 , and l=0 . If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided pusch-Config for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier. If a UE transmits a PUSCH associated with a RS resource index q_{d} , as described in clause 7.1.1, on active UL BWP b of carrier f of serving cell c in slot n and provides a Type 1 power headroom report for an actual PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index q_{d} , the Type 1 power headroom report is for the first PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index q_{d} that overlaps with slot n .",
