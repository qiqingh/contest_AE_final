The RateMatchPattern(s) configured for MBS broadcast is counted into the ones that are configured per serving-cell. A RateMatchPattern may contain: - within a BWP, when provided by PDSCH-Config or within a serving cell when provided by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon, or by PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MTCH, a pair of reserved resources with numerology provided by higher layer parameter subcarrierSpacing given by RateMatchPattern when configured per serving cell or by numerology of associated BWP when configured per BWP. The pair of reserved resources are respectively indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter resourceBlocks given by RateMatchPattern) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters symbolsInResourceBlock given by RateMatchPattern) for which the reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for PDSCH . For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by RateMatchPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair is present in the unit. The periodicityAndPattern can be \\{1,2,4,5,8,10,20 or 40 \\} units long, but maximum of 40 msec . The first symbol of periodicityAndPattern every 40 \\mathrm{msec} / \\mathrm{P} periods is a first symbol in frame n_{f} \\bmod 4=0 , where P is ETSI\n---\n- resourceMapping in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines the OFDM symbol and subcarrier occupancy of the ZP CSI-RS resource within a slot that are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - periodicityAndOffset in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines the ZP-CSI-RS periodicity and slot offset for periodic/semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS. - For the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode for multicast reception, p-Z P -CSI-RS-ResourceSet can be configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast for GC-PDSCH rate matching, subject to UE capability. The REs indicated by p -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are declared as not available for GC-PDSCH. The REs indicated by p -ZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config for unicast do not apply for GC-PDSCH and the REs indicated by p -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast for multicast do not apply for unicast PDSCH. The total number of periodic ZP-CSI-RS-Resources that a UE can be configured with is the same as for unicast in Rel-16. If p-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured in both PDSCH-Config and PDSCH-Config-Multicast, it is subject to UE capability whether the p -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast can be different from the p -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config- ETSI\n---\nWhen configured with SCS \\mu=5 or \\mu=6 , the UE does not expect to be scheduled with more than one unicast PDSCH in a slot, by a single DCI scheduling multiple PDSCHs or by multiple DCIs. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_1 or 1 \\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-CRNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is configured with pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_1 or 1 \\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format 1 \\_1 or 1 \\_2 , the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor, in sps-Config if configured, or across the pdschAggregationFactor in pdsch-config otherwise, consecutive slots. The UE may expect that the TB is repeated within each symbol allocation among each of the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots and the PDSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_1 or 1 \\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CSRNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format 1_1 or 1_2, the UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the reception of pdschAggregationFactor repetitions, in sps-Config if configured, or across the pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config otherwise, larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity P obtained from the corresponding sps-Config. The redundancy version to be applied on the n^{\\text {th }} transmission occasion of the TB, where n=0,1, \\ldots p d s c h -AggregationFactor-1, is determined according to table 5.1.2.1-2 and \" r v_{1 d} indicated by the DCl scheduling the PDSCH\" in table 5.1.2.1-2 is assumed to be 0 for PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format 1 \\_1 or 1 \\_2 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 4 \\_0,4 \\_1 , or 4 \\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is configured with pdsch-AggregationFactor in the pdsch-Config-Multicast associated with the corresponding G-RNTI, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 4 \\_0,4 \\_1 , or 4 \\_2 for multicast reception in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI with NDI =0 , or PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH transmission using associated [SPS-Config-Multicast] and activated by the DCI format 4 \\_0,4 \\_1 , or 4 \\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor, in associated\n---\nTwo downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1 , are supported. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1 \\_0,4 \\_0 or 4 \\_1 then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource assignment' field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 1 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-1-2 in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 1 _2 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 4_2, the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config for DCI format 1 \\_1 or by the higher layer parameter ETSI\n---\nIf a UE is scheduled a PDSCH with DCI format 1 \\_0 or 4 \\_0 , the UE shall assume that P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} is equal to 2 PRBs. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} for bandwidth part is equal to 2 PRBs unless configured by the higher layer parameter prbBundlingType given by PDSCH-Config. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'dynamicBundling', the higher layer parameters bundleSizeSet 1 and bundleSizeSet 2 configure two sets of P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} values, the first set can take one or two P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} values among \\{2,4 , wideband \\} , and the second set can take one P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} value among \\{2,4 , wideband \\} .\n---\nFor the PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_0 , format 1 \\_1 , format 1 \\_2 , format 4 \\_0 , format 4 \\_1 or format 4 \\_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, TC-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or P-RNTI, or for the PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmissions using the higher-layer-provided PDSCH configuration SPS-Config or SPS-Config-Multicast, if the higher layer parameter mcs-Table-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI - the UE shall use I_{M C S} and Table 5.1.3.1-4 to determine the modulation order ( Q_{m} ) and Target code rate ( R ) used in the physical downlink shared channel. elseif mcs-TableDCI-1-2-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) and N_{\\text {on }}^{\\text {PRS }} is the overhead configured by higher layer parameter x Overhead in PDSCH-ServingCellConfigIf the xOverhead in PDSCH-ServingCellconfig is not configured (a value from 6, 12, or 18), the N_{\\text {oh }}^{P R B} is set to 0 . If the PDSCH is scheduled by PDCCH with a CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI or P-RNTI, N_{\\text {oh }}^{P R B} is assumed to be 0 .

If the UE is provided pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16 in SPS-Config or pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-Config and no entry in pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList and pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-1-2 includes repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r 16, N_{\\text {PDSCH }}^{\\text {repeat }}{ }^{\\text {max }} is a maximum value of pdsch-AggregationFactor-r 16 in SPS-Config or pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-Config; otherwise N_{\\text {PDSCH }}^{\\text {repeat }} max =1 . The UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a PDSCH reception - from DL slot n_{D}-N_{\\text {PDSCH }}^{\\text {repeat }}+1 to DL slot n_{D} , if N_{\\text {PDSCH }}^{\\text {repeat }} is provided by pdsch-AggregationFactor or pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16 [6, TS 38.214], or - from DL slot n_{D} -repetitionNumber +1 to DL slot n_{D} , if the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format scheduling the PDSCH reception indicates an entry containing repetitionNumber, or\n---\nFor unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on serving cell c_{2} , the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH on serving cell c_{1} if the PDCCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [ 10 , TS 38.133]) on serving cell c_{2} and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on serving cell c_{1} and serving cell c_{2} . If a UE is provided resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config, or if the UE is additionally provided periodicityAndPattern in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config, the UE can determine a set of RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception scheduled by a unicast DCI format as described in [6, TS 38.214]. If a PDCCH candidate that provides a unicast DCI format is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate. If a UE is provided resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config-Multicast, or if the UE is additionally provided periodicityAndPattern in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config-Multicast, the UE can determine a set of RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception scheduled by a multicast DCI format. If a PDCCH candidate that provides a multicast DCI format is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate.\n---\n- PDSCH for MCCH or MTCH and PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI or by P-RNTI A UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211].
