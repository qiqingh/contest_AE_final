The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.",
