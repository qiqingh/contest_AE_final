    "evidence": "For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR, a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot n and according to antenna port quasi colocation parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with index q_{\\text {new }} provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot n+4+2^{\\mu} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} , where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission and k_{\\text {mac }} is a number of slots provided by K-M a c[12, T S 38.331] or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K-M a c is not provided, within a window configured by BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld and for corresponding PDSCH reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index q_{\\text {new }} until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList. After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.",
