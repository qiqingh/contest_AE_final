The total number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more than 128.\n---\nA UE indicated to release a dedicated RRC connection can be provided one or more configurations by respective one or more ConfiguredGrantConfig, for configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmissions on the initial UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining of this clause, PUSCH transmissions refer to configured grant Type-1 PUSCH transmissions for a configuration provided by ConfiguredGrantConfig. A UE can be provided by sdt-SSB-Subset a number of SS/PBCH block indexes N_{\\mathrm{PUSCH}}^{\\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH}} to map to a number of valid PUSCH occasions for PUSCH transmissions over an association period. If the UE is not provided sdt-SSB-Subset, the UE determines N_{\\text {PUSCH }}^{\\text {SS/PBCH }} from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or by ServingCellConfigCommon. A PUSCH occasion for a PUSCH transmission is defined by a time resource and a frequency resource and is associated with a DM-RS provided by cg-DMRS-Configuration for the configuration of PUSCH transmissions. An association period, starting from frame with SFN 0, for mapping N_{\\text {PUSCH }}^{\\text {SS/PBCH }} SS/PBCH block indexes, from the number of SS/PBCH block indexes, to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources is the smallest value in the set determined by the PUSCH configuration period provided by periodicity in ConfiguredGrantConfig according to Table 19.1-1 such that N_{\\text {PUSCH }}^{\\text {SS/PBCH }} SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources within the association period. A UE is provided a number of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with a PUSCH occasion and a DM-RS resource by sdt-SSB-perCG-PUSCH. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources that are not mapped to N_{\\text {PUSCH }}^{\\text {SS/PBCH }} SS/PBCH block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources.\n---\nIf smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtcl to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration. On the indicated ssbFrequency, the UE shall not consider SS/PBCH block transmission in subframes outside the SMTC occasion for RRM measurements based on SS/PBCH blocks and for RRM measurements based on CSI-RS except for SFTD measurement (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.3.8). 5.5.2.10a RSSI measurement timing configuration\n---\nA UE configured with DRX mode operation [11, TS 38.321] can be provided the following for detection of a DCI format 2_6 in a PDCCH reception on the PCell or on the SpCell [12, TS 38.331] - a PS-RNTI for DCI format 2_6 by ps-RNTI - a number of search space sets, by dci-Format2-6, to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2 _6 on the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell according to a common search space as described in clause 10.1 - a payload size for DCI format 2_6 by sizeDCI-2-6 - a location in DCI format 2_6 of a Wake-up indication bit by ps-PositionDCI-2-6\n---\n10.4 Search space set group switching and skipping of PDCCH monitoring A UE can be provided a group index for a respective Type3-PDCCH CSS set or USS set by searchSpaceGroupIdList for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell. If the UE is not provided searchSpaceGroupIdList for a search space set, the following procedures are not applicable for PDOCH monitoring according to the search space set. If a UE is provided cellGroupsForSwitchList, indicating one or more groups of serving cells, the following procedures apply to all serving cells within each group; otherwise, the following procedures apply only to a serving cell for which the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList.\n---\nPoint A serves as a common reference point for resource block grids and is obtained from: - offsetToPointA for a PCell downlink where offsetToPointA represents the frequency offset between point A and the lowest subcarrier of the lowest resource block, which overlaps with the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, used by the UE for initial cell selection, expressed in units of resource blocks assuming 15 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR1 and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR2; - for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon; - for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 or FR2, and for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing same as the SS/PBCH block used by the UE for initial cell selection;\n---\n\\] In case of cyclic prefix extension of the first OFDM symbol l allocated for PUSCH, SRS, PUCCH, PSCCH/PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SS/PSBCH block transmission, the time-continuous signal s_{\\text {ext }}^{(p, \\mu)}(t) for the interval t_{\\text {start }, l}^{\\mu}-T_{\\text {ext }} \\leq t< t_{\\text {start }, l}^{\\mu} preceding the first OFDM symbol for PUSCH, SRS, PUCCH, PSCCH/PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SS/PSBCH block is given by \\[ s_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{(p, \\mu)}(t)=\\bar{s}_{l}^{(p, \\mu)}(t)\n---\nThe UE shall assume the virtual resource blocks are mapped to physical resource blocks according to the indicated mapping scheme, non-interleaved or interleaved mapping. If no mapping scheme is indicated, the UE shall assume noninterleaved mapping. For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n , except for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format 1 \\_0 in a common search space in which case virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n+N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {COREST }} where N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} is the lowest-numbered physical resource block in the control resource set where the corresponding DCI was received. When two PDCCH candidates from two linked common search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked common search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} . For interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, the mapping process is defined by:\n---\n136 ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05) - for \\bar{L}_{\\text {max }}>4, \\overline{\\dot{i}}_{\\text {SBB }}=\\dot{i}_{\\text {SSB }} where \\dot{i}_{\\text {SSB }} is the three least significant bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index as defined in [5, TS 38.213] with \\bar{L}_{\\max } being the maximum number of candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame, as described in [5, TS 38.213]. 7.4.1.4.2 Mapping to physical resources\n---\n7.4.3.1 Time-frequency structure of an SS/PBCH block In the time domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 4 OFDM symbols, numbered in increasing order from 0 to 3 within the SS/PBCH block, where PSS, SSS, and PBCH with associated DM-RS are mapped to symbols as given by Table 7.4.3.1-1. In the frequency domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 240 contiguous subcarriers with the subcarriers numbered in increasing order from 0 to 239 within the SS/PBCH block. The quantities k and l represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block. The UE may assume that the complex-valued symbols corresponding to resource elements denoted as 'Set to 0 ' in Table 7.4.3.1-1 are set to zero. The quantity v in Table 7.4.3.1-1 is given by v=N_{\\mathrm{ID}}^{\\text {cell }} \\bmod 4 . The quantity k_{\\mathrm{SSB}} is the subcarrier offset from subcarrier 0 in common resource block N_{\\mathrm{CRB}}^{\\text {SSB }} to the lowest-numbered subcarrier of the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, where N_{\\text {CRB }}^{\\text {SSB }} is obtained from the higher-layer parameter offsetToPointA.\n---\nThe mapping to resource elements (k, l)_{p, \\mu} not reserved for PBCH DM-RS shall be in increasing order of first the index k and then the index l , where k and l represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block and are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1. The UE shall assume the sequence of complex-valued symbols r(0), \\ldots, r(143) constituting the demodulation reference signals for the SS/PBCH block to be scaled by a factor of \\beta_{\\text {PBCH }}^{\\text {DM-RS }} to conform to the PBCH power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and to be mapped to resource elements (k, l)_{p, \\mu} in increasing order of first k and then l where k and l are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block. 7.4.3.2 Time location of an SS/PBCH block\n---\n8.4.3.1 Time-frequency structure of an S-SS/PSBCH block In the time domain, an S-SS/PSBCH block consists of N_{\\text {symb }}^{S-S S B} OFDM symbols, numbered in increasing order from 0 to N_{\\text {symb }}^{\\text {S-SSB }}-1 within the S-SS/PSBCH block, where S-PSS, S-SSS, and PSBCH with associated DM-RS are mapped to symbols as given by Table 8.4.3.1-1.
