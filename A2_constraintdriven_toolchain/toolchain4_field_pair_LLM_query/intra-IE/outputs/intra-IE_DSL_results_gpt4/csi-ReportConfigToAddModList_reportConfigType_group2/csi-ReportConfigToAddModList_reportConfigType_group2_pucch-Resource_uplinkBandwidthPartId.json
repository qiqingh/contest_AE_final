    "evidence": "When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, corresponding to the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell, as described in Clause 9.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. If the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell corresponds to two spatial relations, the UE shall transmit the PUSCH according to the spatial relation with the lower ID.\n---\nTwo transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.\n---\n2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and 2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:\n---\nIn addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or SLDRX Command indication. The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\n- PUCCH Resource ID: This field contains an identifier of the PUCCH resource ID identified by PUCCHResourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5].
