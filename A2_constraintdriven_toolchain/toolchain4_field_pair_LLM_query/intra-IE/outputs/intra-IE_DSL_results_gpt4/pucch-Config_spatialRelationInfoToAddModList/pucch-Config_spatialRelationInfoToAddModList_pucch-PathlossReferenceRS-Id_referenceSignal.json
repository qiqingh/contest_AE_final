The set of RS resources is provided by pathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index.
