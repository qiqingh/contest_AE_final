If repetition is set to 'off', the UE shall not assume that the CSI-RS resources within the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'none' and if the CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) contains a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet that is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition and without the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE can only be configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer parameter nrofPorts for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block. 5.1.6.1.3 CSI-RS for mobility\n---\nFor MsgA PUSCH transmission, if the UE is not configured with msgA-PUSCH-DMRS-CDM-group, the UE shall assume that 2 DM-RS CDM groups are configured. Otherwise, msgA-PUSCH-DMRS-CDM-group indicates which DM-RS CDM group to use from the set of \\{0,1\\} . For MsgA PUSCH transmission, if the UE is not configured with msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts, the UE shall assume that 4 ports are configured per DM-RS CDM group for double-symbol DM-RS. Otherwise, msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts with value of 0 indicates the first port per DM-RS CDM group, while a value of 1 indicates the first two ports per DM-RS CDM group. For uplink DM-RS with PUSCH, the UE may assume the ratio of PUSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE ( \\beta_{\\text {DMRS }}[\\mathrm{dB}] ) is given by Table 6.2.2-1 according to the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data. The DM-RS scaling factor \\beta_{\\text {PLSCH }}^{\\text {DIRS }} specified in clause 6.4.1.1.3 of [4, TS 38.211] is given by \\beta_{\\text {PUSCH }}^{\\text {DRARS }}=10^{-\\frac{\\beta_{\\text {CHWS }}}{20}} .\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} frequencyDomainAllocation Frequency domain allocation within a physical resource block in accordance with TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.5.3.
