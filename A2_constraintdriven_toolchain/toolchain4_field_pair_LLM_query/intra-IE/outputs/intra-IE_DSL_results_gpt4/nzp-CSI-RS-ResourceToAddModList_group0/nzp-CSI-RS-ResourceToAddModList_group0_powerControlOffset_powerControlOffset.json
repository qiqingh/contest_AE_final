For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value is defined by a 7-bit value in the range [-23,40] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', the UE shall use differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range [ -23,40 ] dB with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a 4 -bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset. When one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement\n---\n- density in resourceMapping defines CSI-RS frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB, and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density value of 1 / 2 , where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4 - 1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid. - cdm-Type in resourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. - powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} with 1 dB step size. - powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of NZP CSI-RS EPRE to SS/PBCH block EPRE. - scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits.",
