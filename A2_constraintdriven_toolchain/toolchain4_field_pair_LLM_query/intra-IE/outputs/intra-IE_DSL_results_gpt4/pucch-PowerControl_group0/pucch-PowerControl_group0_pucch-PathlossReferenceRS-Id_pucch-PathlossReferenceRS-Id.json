The set of RS resources can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource in the set of RS resources to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by indexes provided by corresponding values of pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id, between a set of pucchSpatialRelationInfold values and a set of referenceSignal values provided by PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS. If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo includes servingCellld indicating a serving cell, the UE receives the RS for resource index q_{d} on the active DL BWP of the serving cell\n---\n- If the UE is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB - If the UE is provided a number of RS resource indexes, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using RS resource with index q_{d} , where 0 \\leq q_{d}<Q_{d}-Q_{d} is a size for a set of RS resources provided by maxNrofPUCCHPathlossReferenceRSs.
