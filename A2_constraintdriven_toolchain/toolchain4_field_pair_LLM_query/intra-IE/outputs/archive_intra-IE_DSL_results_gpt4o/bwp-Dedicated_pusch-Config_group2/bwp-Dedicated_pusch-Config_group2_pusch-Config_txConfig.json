    "evidence": "For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nTwo transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 , the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.\n---\nFor a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP b , as described in clause 12 , of carrier f of serving cell c , a UE first calculates a linear value \\hat{P}_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) of the transmit power P_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) , with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1. For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than DCI format 0 \\_0 , or configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, if txConfig in PUSCH-Config is set to 'codebook',",
