A UE monitors PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH receptions for MCCH or MTCH as described in clause 10.1. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon or PDSCH-ConfigCommon, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for MCCH/MTCH PDCCH receptions or PDSCH receptions, respectively, is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. A UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs for MCCH or MTCH on two serving cells. A UE in the RRC_IDLE state or in the RRC_INACTIVE state is not required to simultaneously receive on a serving cell",
