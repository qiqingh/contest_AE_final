The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot, if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was not contained within the first three symbols of the slot. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], if the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH with mapping Type A were received in the same slot as the PDSCH, both PDCCH candidates are expected to be contained within the first three symbols of the slot.

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot, if the first symbol of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in a later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain resource allocation.

When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 1 \\_1 or DCI format 0 \\_1 if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 0 \\_1 or 1 \\_1 , the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator'\n---\nWhen a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' and indicated DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the number of PDSCH transmission occasions is derived by the number of TCI states indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' of the scheduling DCI. - If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication', the UE is expected to receive two PDSCH transmission occasions, where the first TCI state is applied to the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1. The second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion, and the second PDSCH transmission occasion shall have the same number of symbols as the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the UE is configured by the higher layers with a value \\bar{K} in StartingSymbolOffsetK, it shall determine that the first symbol of the second PDSCH transmission occasion starts after \\bar{K} symbols from the last symbol of the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the value \\bar{K} is not configured via the higher layer parameter StartingSymbolOffsetK, \\bar{K}=0 shall be assumed by the UE. The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion. For two PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where n=0,1 applied respectively to the first and second TCI state. The UE expects the PDSCH mapping type indicated by DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' to be mapping type B , and the indicated PDSCH mapping type is applied to both PDSCH transmission occasions. - Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause 5.1.2.1.\n---\nThe UE shall not transmit anything on the resources configured by configuredGrantConfig if the higher layers did not deliver a transport block to transmit on the resources allocated for uplink transmission without grant. A set of allowed periodicities P are defined in [12, TS 38.331]. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofSlots, provides the number of consecutive slots allocated within a configured grant period. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofPUSCHInSlot provides the number of consecutive PUSCH allocations within a slot, where the first PUSCH allocation follows the higher layer parameter timeDomainAllocation for Type 1 PUSCH transmission or the higher layer configuration according to [10, TS 38.321], and UL grant received on the DCI for Type 2 PUSCH transmissions, and the remaining PUSCH allocations have the same length and PUSCH mapping type, and are appended following the previous allocations without any gaps. The same combination of start symbol and length and PUSCH mapping type repeats over the consecutively allocated slots. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, and when the higher layer parameter ueSemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is not configured, where a UE is performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM symbols on all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension T_{\\text {ext }} to be applied for transmission according to [4, TS 38.211] where the index for \\Delta_{i} [4, TS 38.211] is chosen randomly from a set of values configured by higher layers according to the following rule:",
