NOTE 1: A timer is running once it is started, until it is stopped or until it expires; otherwise it is not running. A timer can be started if it is not running or restarted if it is running. A Timer is always started or restarted from its initial value. The duration of a timer is not updated until it is stopped or expires (e.g. due to BWP switching). When the MAC entity applies zero value for a timer, the timer shall be started and immediately expire unless explicitly stated otherwise. NOTE 2: In this version of the specification, the SRS in the procedural description includes Positioning SRS except for the Positioning SRS for transmission in RRC_INACTIVE as in clause 5.26. Positioning SRS except for the Positioning SRS for transmission in RRC_INACTIVE is treated the same as SRS by the UE unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n---\nFor each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if configured and activated, the MAC entity shall: 1> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the PDCCH for this Serving Cell: 2> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration, transport block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink assignment and to deliver it to the HARQ entity; 2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PDSCH duration;\n---\nUplink grant is either received dynamically on the PDCCH , in a Random Access Response, configured semipersistently by RRC or determined to be associated with the PUSCH resource of MSGA as specified in clause 5.1.2a. The MAC entity shall have an uplink grant to transmit on the UL-SCH. To perform the requested transmissions, the MAC layer receives HARQ information from lower layers. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI =0 is considered as a configured uplink grant. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI =1 is considered as a dynamic uplink grant. For a BWP configured with s T x-2 P anel, the MAC entity considers the PUSCH duration of one uplink grant overlaps with the PUSCH duration of another uplink grant if they are overlapping in time and associated with an srsResourceSetld corresponding to the same coresetPoollndex. If the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, a Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each Serving Cell belonging to a TAG that has a running timeAlignmentTimer or a running cg-SDTTimeAlignmentTimer and for each grant received for this PDCCH occasion:\n---\n3> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle; or 3> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR) or an uplink grant determined as specified in clause 5.1 .2 a for MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or 3> if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization and the BWP is not configured with s T x 2Panel, and if this uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with a PUSCH duration of another uplink grant received on the PDCCH; or 3> if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization and the BWP is configured with sTx2Panel, and if this uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant associated with an srsResourceSetld corresponding to a coresetPoollndex, and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with a PUSCH duration of another uplink grant received on the PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex; or 3> if the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization and this uplink grant is not a prioritized uplink grant:\n---\n1> select the logical channels for each UL grant that satisfy all the following conditions: 2> the set of allowed Subcarrier Spacing index values in allowedSCS-List, if configured, includes the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL grant; and 2> maxPUSCH-Duration, if configured, is larger than or equal to the PUSCH transmission duration associated to the UL grant; and 2> configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the UL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and 2> allowedServingCells, if configured, includes the Cell information associated to the UL grant.
