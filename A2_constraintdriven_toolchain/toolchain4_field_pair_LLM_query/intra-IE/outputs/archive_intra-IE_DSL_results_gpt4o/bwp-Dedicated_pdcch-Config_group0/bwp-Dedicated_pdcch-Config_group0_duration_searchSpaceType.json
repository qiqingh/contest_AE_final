When the PDCCH reception incudes two PDCCH candidates from two respectvie search space sets, as described in clause 10 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling the PDSCH ends at least 14 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\n- An aperiodic CSI report occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\n- a duration of T_{s}<k_{s} indicating a number of slots that the search space set s exists by duration, or a number of slots in consecutive groups of slots where the search space set s can exist by duration-r 17\n---\nIf a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot.\n---\nIf a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_5 is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats 2-5 indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot. An [AB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2 _ 5 with CRC scrambled by AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets:\n---\nThis parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.\n---\n- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least P_{\\text {switch }} symbols after a slot where the timer expires or, if the UE is provided a search space set to monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format 2 \\_0 , after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format 2 \\_0 when \\mu \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\} - at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of X_{s} slots, that is at least P_{\\text {switch }} symbols after a slot where the timer expires or, if the UE is provided a search space set to monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format 2 \\_0 , after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format 2 \\_0 when \\mu \\in\\{5,6\\}\n---\n- a '01' value for the bits indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 , if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17 - a ' 10^{\\prime} value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the value in the set of durations\n---\nIn any slot, the UE is not expected to have more active CSI-RS ports or active CSI-RS resources in active BWPs than reported as capability. NZP CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used. For semi-persistent CSI-RS, starting from the end of when the activation command is applied, and ending at the end of when the deactivation command is applied. For periodic CSI-RS, starting when the periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layer signalling, and ending when the periodic CSI-RS configuration is released. If a CSI-RS resource is referred N times by one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted N times. For a CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, if a CSIRS resource is referred X times by one of the M CSI-RS resources, where M is defined in clause 5.2.1.4.2, and/or one or two Resource Pairs, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted X times.",
