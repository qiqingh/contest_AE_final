A UE is not expected to receive an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveB WP the UE is not expected to be triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP.

For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'periodic': - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing', or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-spatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS.

When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRSResource and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo-PDC contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRSPDC', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS for RTT-based propagation delay compensation according to clause 9 . For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'semi-persistent': - when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on SRS transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }}{ }^{\\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet, each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise.

In case a SRS resource with resourceType set as 'semi-persistent' is triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the semi-persistent SRS resource and only the periodic SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with the semi-persistent SRS resource are transmitted. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', and a guard period of Y symbols is configured according to Clause 6.2.1.2, the UE shall use the same priority rules as defined above during the guard period as if SRS was configured.\n---\nSRS-ResourceSet set to 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same time.
