Candidate slots in which the configured SRS resource may be used for SRS transmission are the slots satisfying\n---\nThe time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.\n---\n- Time domain behaviour of SRS resource configuration as indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType, which may be periodic, semi-persistent, aperiodic SRS transmission as defined in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. - Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher layer parameters periodicityAndOffset- p or periodicityAndOffset-sp for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource set SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet with different slot level periodicities. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a list of zero up to four different available slot offset values from the reference slot n+k to the slot where the aperiodic SRS resource set is transmitted where n is the slot with triggering DCI and k is SlotOffset is defined by the higher layer parameter AvailableSlotOffset. The parameter AvailableSlotOffset can be configured up to 4 different values. For an SRSPosResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', the slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset for each SRS resource.\n---\n- zero or two SRS resource sets each configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic', if the UE is not indicating a capability for extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration, or zero or one or two SRS resource or four SRS resource sets each configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration].
