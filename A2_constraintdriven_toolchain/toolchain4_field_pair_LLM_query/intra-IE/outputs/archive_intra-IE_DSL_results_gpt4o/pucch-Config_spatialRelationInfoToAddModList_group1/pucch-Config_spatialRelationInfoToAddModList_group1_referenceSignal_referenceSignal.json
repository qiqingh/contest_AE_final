    "evidence": "For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'semi-persistent': - when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on SRS transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }}{ }^{\\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet, each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, each [D in the list of reference signal [Ds may refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell indicated by PCI field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a d l- PRS-ID indicated by DL-PRS ID field in the activation command. - if an SRS resource in the activated resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, the UE shall assume that the ID of the reference signal in the activation command overrides the one configured in spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos.\n---\n- If the UE is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB - If the UE is provided a number of RS resource indexes, the UE calculates P L_{b, f, c}\\left(q_{d}\\right) using RS resource with index q_{d} , where 0 \\leq q_{d}<Q_{d}-Q_{d} is a size for a set of RS resources provided by maxNrofPUCCHPathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources is provided by pathlossReferenceRSs. The set of RS resources can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource in the set of RS resources to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by indexes provided by corresponding values of pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id, between a set of pucchSpatialRelationInfold values and a set of referenceSignal values provided by PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS. If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo includes servingCellld indicating a serving cell, the UE receives the RS for resource index q_{d} on the active DL BWP of the serving cell - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines the referenceSignal values in PUCCHPathlossReferenceRS that are indicated in the one or two sets of power control parameter\n---\nThe types of UE power headroom reports are the following. A Type 1 UE power headroom P H that is valid for PUSCH transmission occasion i on active UL BWP b of carrier f of serving cell c . A Type 3 UE power headroom PH that is valid for SRS transmission occasion i on active UL BWP b of carrier f of serving cell c . A UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell [11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the first DCI format scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block since a power headroom report was triggered if the power headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format. Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus T_{\\text {proc. } 2}=T_{\\text {proc. } 2} where T_{\\text {proc. } 2} is determined according to [6, TS 38.214] assuming d_{2, l}=1, d_{2,2}=0 , and with \\mu_{D L} corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using the configured grant.
