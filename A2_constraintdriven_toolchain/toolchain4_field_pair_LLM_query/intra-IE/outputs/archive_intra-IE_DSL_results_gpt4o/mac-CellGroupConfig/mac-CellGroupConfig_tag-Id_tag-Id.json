    "evidence": "It has a fixed size and consists of two octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.4a-1): - Timing Advance Command: This field indicates the index value TA used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the field is 12 bits; - TI: If two TAGs are configured for the SpCell, this field indicates one of the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If tag2-flag is set to true by upper layers, the field set to 0 indicates the tag2-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag-Id of the SpCell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the tag-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag2-Id of the SpCell. If the SpCell is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead; - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .\n---\n292 ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08) - Timing Advance Command: This field indicates whether the TA is valid for the LTM target cell (i.e. the SpCell corresponding to the target configuration indicated by Target Configuration ID field). If the value of this field is set to FFF, this field indicates that no valid timing adjustment is available for the PTAG of the LTM target cell; otherwise, this field indicates the index value T_{A} used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6], and that the UE can skip the Random Access procedure for this LTM cell switch. If tag-Id-ptr is configured for the TCI state indicated by the TCI state ID field in the LTM target cell and tag-Id-ptr is set to value n l , this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag2-Id of the LTM target cell; otherwise, this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag-id of the LTM target cell. The length of the field is 12 bits; - TCI state ID: This field indicates and activates the TCI state for the LTM target cell (i.e. the SpCell of the target configuration indicated by the Target Configuration ID field). The TCI state is identified by TCI-Stateld in Itm-DL-OrJointTCI-StateToAddModList as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If the value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Itm-TCI-Info of the configuration indicated by Target Configuration ID field is joint, this field is for joint TCI state, otherwise, this field is for downlink TCI state. The length of the field is 7 bits; - UL TCI state ID: This field indicates and activates the uplink TCI state for the LTM target cell (i.e. the SpCell of the target configuration indicated by the Target Configuration ID field). The UL TCI state is identified by TCI-UL-Stateld in Itm-UL-TCI-StatesToAddModList as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The octet containing this field (i.e. this field and the two reserved bits in the same octet) is included if the value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Itm-TCI-Info of the configuration indicated by Target Configuration ID field is separate. The length of the field is 6 bits;\n---\nThe MAC RAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3-1, and consists of the following fields: - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ; - TI: If two TAGs are configured for the Serving Cell in which the Random Access procedure is being performed, this field indicates one of the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If tag2-flag is set to true by upper layers, the field set to 0 indicates the tag2-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag-Id of the Serving Cell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the tag-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag2-Id of the Serving Cell. If the Serving Cell in which the Random Access procedure is being performed is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead; - Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates the index value T_{A} used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits; - UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used on the uplink in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27 bits;\n---\nThe fallbackRAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3a-1, and consists of the following fields: - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ; - TI: If two TAGs are configured for the SpCell, this field indicates one of the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If tag2-flag is set to true by upper layers, the field set to 0 indicates the tag2-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag-Id of the SpCell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the tag-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag2-Id of the SpCell. If the SpCell is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead; - Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates the index value T_{A} used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits; - UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used on the uplink in TS 38.213 [6].
