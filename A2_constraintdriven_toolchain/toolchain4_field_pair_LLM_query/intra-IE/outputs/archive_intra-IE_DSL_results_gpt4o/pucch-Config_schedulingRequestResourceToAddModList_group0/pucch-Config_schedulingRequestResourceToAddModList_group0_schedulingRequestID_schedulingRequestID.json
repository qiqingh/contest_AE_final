    "evidence": "The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured. Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or a DSR (clause 5.4.9) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request (clause 5.25 ) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8). RRC configures the following parameters for the scheduling request procedure:\n---\n5.22.1.5 Scheduling Request In addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or SLDRX Command indication. The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR.\n---\n104 ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05) - a first set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld =0 if O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq 2 including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or - a second set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld =1 , if provided by higher layers, if 2<O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq N_{2} where \\mathrm{N}_{2} is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId =1 ; otherwise N_{2} is equal to 1706 , or - a third set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld =2 , if provided by higher layers, if N_{2}<O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq N_{3} where \\mathrm{N}_{3} is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId =2 ; otherwise N_{3} is equal to 1706 , or\n---\nA UE can be configured by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 . A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0 . The UE is also configured a periodicity S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} in symbols or slots and an offset S R_{\\text {OFFSET }} in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu}[4 , TS 38.211] in a frame with number n_{f} if \\left(n_{f} \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\\mu}-S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 .\n---\n9.2 UCI reporting in physical uplink control channel UCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and CSI. UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1. For the remaining of this clause, any reference to S R is applicable for S R and/or for L R R . A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate, at least one of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.\n---\n- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2. A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include DL ETSI\n---\n9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH In the following, a UE is configured to transmit K PUCCHs for respective K SRs in a slot, as determined by a set of schedulingRequestResourceld, a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, and a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell, with SR transmission occasions that would overlap with a transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information from the UE in the slot or with a transmission of a PUCCH with CSI report(s) from the UE in the slot. If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.3.

The RA accesses associated to Initial access from RRC_IDLE, RRC re-establishment procedure, transition from RRC-INACTIVE. The indicator beamFailureRecovery is used in case of successful beam failure recovery related RA procedure in the SpCell [3]. The indicator reconfigurationWithSync is used if the UE executes a reconfiguration with sync. The indicator ulUnSynchronized is used if the random access procedure is initiated in a SpCell by DL or UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED when the timeAlignmentTimer is not running in the PTAG or if the RA procedure is initiated in a serving cell by a PDCCH order [3]. The indicator schedulingRequestFailure is used in case of SR failures [3]. The indicator noPUCCHResourceAvailable is used when the UE has no valid SR PUCCH resources configured [3]. The indicator requestForOtherS/is used for MSG1 based on demand SI request. The indicator msg3RequestForOtherS/is used in case of MSG3 based SI request. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l}",
