The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR.\n---\nAn SRS resource is configured by the SRS-Resource IE or the SRS-PosResource [E and consists of - \\quad N_{\\text {ap }}^{\\text {SRS }} \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} antenna ports \\left\\{p_{i}\\right\\}_{i=0}^{N_{\\text {ap }}^{\\text {SRS }}-1} , where the number of antenna ports is given by the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports or nrofSRS-Ports- n 8 if configured, otherwise N_{\\text {ap }}^{\\mathrm{SRS}}=1 , and p_{i}=1000+i when the SRS resource is in a SRS resource set with higher-layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet not set to 'nonCodebook', or determined according to [6, TS 38.214] when the SRS resource is in a SRS resource set with higher-layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook'. - \\quad N_{\\mathrm{hop}} , the number of hops for SRS Tx hopping for an SRS resource configured by SRS-PosResource given by the higher layer parameter SRShoppingNrofHops if configured, otherwise N_{\\mathrm{hop}}=1 . - \\quad N_{\\text {symb }}^{\\text {SRS }} \\in\\{1,2,4,8,10,12,14\\} consecutive OFDM symbols given by the field nroffymbols contained in the higher layer parameter resourceMapping. If N_{\\mathrm{hop}}>1, N_{\\mathrm{symb}}^{\\mathrm{SRS}} is the number of consecutive OFDM symbol per hop.\n---\n6.2.1.1 UE SRS frequency hopping procedure For a given S R S resource, the U E is configured with repetition factor R \\in\\{1,2,4\\} or R \\in\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14\\} by higher layer parameter resourceMapping in SRS-Resource where R \\leq N_{s} . When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is not configured ( R=N_{s} ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped in all the N_{s} symbols to the same set of subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition ( R=1 ), according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{\\text {SRS }}, C_{\\text {SRS }} and b_{\\text {hop }} defined in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within an SRS resource in each slot are configured ( N_{s} \\geq 4, R \\geq 2 ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and frequency hopping across the \\frac{N_{S}}{R} pairs is according to the SRS hopping parameters B_{S R S}, C_{S R S} and b_{\\text {hop }} , where N_{S} should be divisible by R . For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that multiple hops of an SRS resource transmission are in different RB sets.\n---\nIn sidelink resource allocation mode 2 , the UE measures RSRP for resource selection as follows: - PSSCH-RSRP over the DM-RS resource elements for the PSSCH according to the received SCI format 1-A if higher layer parameter s/-RS-ForSensing is set to 'pssch', and - PSCCH-RSRP over the DM-RS resource elements for the PSCCH carrying to the received SCI format 1-A if higher layer parameter s/-RS-ForSensing is set to 'pscch'.\n---\n9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet in PUCCH-Config, a PUCCH resource set is provided by pucch-ResourceCommon through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} PRBs. For operation in FR2-2, pucch-ResourceCommon can also provide a number of N_{R B} RBs for the PUCCH resource set; otherwise N_{R B}=1 . The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }} , and a cyclic shift index set for a PUCCH transmission.\n---\nSR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1. The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining m_{0} as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 . For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting b(0)=0 . 9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types\n---\n- set the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by the bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format 0 \\_1 and indicates an active UL BWP with different SCS configuration \\mu , or with different number N_{\\text {RB-set, UL }}^{\\text {BWP }} of RB sets, than a current active UL BWP, the UE determines an uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 based on X^{\\prime} bits and Y^{\\prime} bits that are generated by independently truncating or padding the X MSBs and the Y LSBs [6, TS 38.214] of the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI format 0 \\_1 , where truncation starts from the MSBs of the X bits or the Y bits, zero-padding prepends zeros to the X bits or the Y bits, and - if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration \\mu=1 and the current active BWP has SCS configuration \\mu=0 , the X MSBs are truncated to X^{\\prime}=X-1 bits, or - if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration \\mu=0 and the current active BWP has SCS configuration \\mu=1 , the X MSBs are zero-padded to X^{\\prime}=X+1 bits\n---\nThe SP SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1.
