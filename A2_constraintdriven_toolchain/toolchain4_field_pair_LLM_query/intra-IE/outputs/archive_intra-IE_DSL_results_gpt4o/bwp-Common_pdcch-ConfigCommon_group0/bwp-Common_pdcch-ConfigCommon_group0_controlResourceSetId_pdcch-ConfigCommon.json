    "evidence": "- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in the CORESET if the CORESET is configured by the PBCH or by the controlResourceSetZero field in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon IE,\n---\nNOTE 3: The Enhanced TCI State Indication for UE specific PDCCH MAC CE is not applicable to the CORESET configured by controlResourceSetZero if the CORESET is associated with the search space configured by pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB, or searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, or pagingSearchSpace in PDCCH-ConfigCommon.\n---\nUpon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if k_{S S B}<24 [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if k_{S S B}<12 for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if k_{S S B}>23 for FR1 or if k_{S S B}>11 for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon.\n---\nIf a UE is provided controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigSIBl or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a search space set from controlResourcesetZero as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions for the search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP.\n---\nIf during cell search a UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE determines a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from controlResourceSetZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1, as described in Tables 13-1 through 13-10, for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, or as described in Tables 13-1A and 13-4A for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or as described in Table 13-10A for FR22, and determines PDCCH monitoring occasions from searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIBI, included in MIB, as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. SFN { }_{\\mathrm{c}} and n_{\\mathrm{c}} are the SFN and slot index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and SFN \\mathrm{SSB}_{i} and n_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively, where the \\mathrm{SS} / \\mathrm{PBCH} block with index i overlaps in time with system frame \\mathrm{SFN}_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} and slot n_{\\mathrm{SSB}, i} . The symbols of the CORESET associated with pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or with searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCHConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix.\n---\ncontrolResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon. The network shall not use same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSetExt configured via SIB20 in this field.",
