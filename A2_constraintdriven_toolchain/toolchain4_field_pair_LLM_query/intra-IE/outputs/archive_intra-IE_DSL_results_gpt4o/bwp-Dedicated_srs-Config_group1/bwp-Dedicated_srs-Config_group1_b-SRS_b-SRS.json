All triggered BSRs may be cancelled when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission but is not sufficient to additionally accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a Long, Refined Long, Extended Long, Short, or Extended Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. NOTE 3: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains a BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.\n---\n2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1: 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure in clause 5.4 .3 to generate the SL-BSR MAC CE(s); 3> start or restart sl-periodicBSR-Timer except when all the generated SL-BSRs are Truncated SL-BSRs; 3> start or restart sl-retxBSR-Timer. 2> if a Regular SL-BSR has been triggered and sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer is not running:\n---\nThe MAC entity shall restart sl-retxBSR-Timer upon reception of an SL grant for transmission of new data on any SLSCH.
