If the SCS of configured DL BWP(s) is larger than the reference SCS, network configures startPosition and nrofSymbols such that the configured CLI-RSSI resource not to exceed the slot boundary corresponding to the configured BWP SCS.

The configured SRS resource does not exceed the slot boundary. If resourceMapping-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix). If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbois and repetitionFactor to ' n 1 '. \\end{tabular} \\begin{tabular}{l}",
