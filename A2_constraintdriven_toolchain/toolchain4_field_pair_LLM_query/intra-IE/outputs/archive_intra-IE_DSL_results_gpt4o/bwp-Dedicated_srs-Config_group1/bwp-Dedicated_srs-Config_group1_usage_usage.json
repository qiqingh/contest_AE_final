Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config.

When only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3. The TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3-1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The indicated SRI in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI.

For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.\n---\n6.1.1.2 Non-Codebook based UL transmission For non-codebook based transmission, PUSCH can be scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_1, \\mathrm{DCI} format 0 \\_2 or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3. If this PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0_1, DCI format 0 \\_2 , or semi-statically configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE can determine its PUSCH precoder(s) and transmission rank based on the SRI(s) when multiple SRS resources are configured, where the SRI(s) is given by one or two SRS resource indicator(s) in DCI according to clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5,38.212] for DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 , or the SRI is given by srs-ResourceIndicator according to clause 6.1.2.3, or two SRIs given by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator 2 according to clause 6.1.2.3. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) applicable for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 in SRS-config, respectively. The UE shall use one or multiple SRS resources for SRS transmission, where, in a SRS resource set, the maximum number of SRS resources which can be configured to the UE for simultaneous transmission in the same symbol and the maximum number of SRS resources are UE capabilities. The SRS resources transmitted simultaneously occupy the same RBs. Only one SRS port for each SRS resource is configured. Only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', and only one or two SRS resource sets can be configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook'. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', one or two SRIs are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicators in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6.1.2.1. The maximum number of SRS resources per SRS resource set that can be configured for non-codebook based uplink transmission is 4 . Each of the indicated one or two SRIs in slot n is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS transmission is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1 _ 1 if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 0 \\_1 or 1 \\_1 , the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' value ' 0 '. When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be scheduled with a DCI in slot n to transmit a PUSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI with K_{2} smaller than \\left\\lceil K_{2 \\text { min }} \\cdot \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu}}\\right\\rceil , where K_{2 \\text { mn }} and \\mu are the applied minimum scheduling offset restriction and the numerology of the active UL BWP of the scheduled cell when receiving the DCI in slot n , respectively, and \\mu^{\\prime} is the numerology of the new active UL BWP in case of active UL BWP change in the scheduled cell and is equal to \\mu , otherwise. The minimum scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PUSCH transmission is scheduled by RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant for RACH procedure, or when PUSCH is scheduled with TC-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', for PUSCH repetition Type A, in case K>1 , the same symbol allocation is applied across the K consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall repeat the TB across the K consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, and the association of the first and second SRS resource set in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 to each slot is determined as follows: - if a DCI format 0 \\_1 or DCI format 0 \\_2 indicates codepoint \" 00 \" for the SRS resource set indicator, the first SRS resource set is associated with all K consecutive slots, - if a DCI format 0 \\_1 or DCI format 0 \\_2 indicates codepoint \" 01 \" for the SRS resource set indicator, the second SRS resource set is associated with all K consecutive slots,\n---\nDCI format 0_1 for a given resource allocation type indicated by resourceAllocation, except if uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, in which case uplink type 2 resource allocation is used wherein the UE interprets the LSB bits in the higher layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation as for the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI 0_1 according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.2.2.3; - The I_{M C S} is provided by higher layer parameter mcsAndTBS; - Number of DM-RS CDM groups, DM-RS ports, SRS resource indication and DM-RS sequence initialization are determined as in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], and the antenna port value, the bit value for DM-RS sequence initialization, precoding information and number of layers, SRS resource indicator are provided by antennaPort, dmrs-SeqInitialization, precodingAndNumberOfLayers, and srs-ResourceIndicator respectively; When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2, precoding information and number of layers (applicable when higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook') associated with the first and second SRS resource set is provided by precodingAndNumberOfLayers and precodingAndNumberOfLayers2, respectively, and SRS resource indicators associated with the first and second SRS resource sets are provided by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2, respectively. When both srsResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 are configured with two SRS resource sets, the two SRS resource sets configured by srs-ResourceSetToAddModList is used to determine the SRS resource indications by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2. - If two SRS resource sets with usage set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook' are configured in srsResourceSetToAddModList, the two SRS resource sets are used to determine the SRS resource indications by srs-Resourcelndicator and srs-Resourcelndicator 2. - otherwise, the two SRS resource sets with usage set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook' configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 are used to determine the SRS resource indications by srsResourceIndicator and srs-Resourcelndicator2.\n---\n- For PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, a dropping or cancellation of a PUSCH transmission according to clause 9 , clause 11.1 and clause 11.2A of [6, TS 38.213]. - For PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, a dropping or cancellation of a PUCCH transmission according to clause 9, clause 9.2.6 and clause 11.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. - For any two consecutive PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B, and when two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', a different SRS resource set association is used for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A , or PUSCH repetition type B , according to Clause 6.1.2.1. - For any two consecutive PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, and when a PUCCH resource used for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission by a UE includes first and second spatial relations or first and second sets of power control parameters, as described in [10, TS 38.321] and in clause 7.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213], different spatial relations or different power control parameters are used for the two PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, according to Clause 9.2 .6 of [6, TS 38.213]. - Uplink timing adjustment in response to a timing advance command according to clause 4.2 of [6, TS 38.213].\n---\n6.2.1 UE sounding procedure The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K \\geq 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306].

The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.

When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'noncodebook', the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit corresponding to each SRS resource set is determined based on SRI(s) corresponding to the associated SRS resource set or higher layer parameter sri-ResourceIndicator or sriResourceIndicator 2 corresponding to the associated SRS resource set in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. A UE is configured with the PT-RS port index for each configured SRS resource by the higher layer parameter ptrs-PortIndex configured by SRS-Config if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in DMRSUplinkConfig. If the PT-RS port index associated with different SRIs are the same, the corresponding UL DM-RS ports are associated to the one UL PT-RS port. For partial-coherent and non-coherent codebook-based UL transmission, the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) is determined based on TPMI(s) and/or number of layers which are indicated by 'Precoding information and number of layers' field(s) in DCI format 0 \\_1 and DCI format 0 \\_2 or configured by higher layer parameter precodingAndNumberOfLayers:\n---\nNOTE 1: The usage of MCS-C-RNTI is equivalent to that of C-RNTI in MAC procedures (except for the C-RNTI MAC CE).
