The set of P_{\\mathrm{O} \\_ \\text {UE_PUCCH }} values is provided by p0-Set.

If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the p0-PUCCH-Value value through the link to a corresponding p 0-P U C C H-I d index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }, \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH - If the UE is provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321 ] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines p0-PUCCH-Value value according to the corresponding one or two sets of power control parameters. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} where k is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.\n---\n- If the UE obtains a TPC command value from a DCI format associated with the PUCCH transmission and if the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by an index provided by p0-PUCCH-Id, between a set of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold values and a set of values for closedLoopIndex that provide the l value(s). If the UE receives an activation command indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the value closedLoopIndex that provides the value of l through the link to a corresponding p0-PUCCH-Id index\n---\n- if the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE determines the value of l from the value of q_{u} based on a pucch-SpatialRelationInfold value associated with the p0-PUCCH-Id value corresponding to q_{u} and with the closedLoopIndex value corresponding to l ;",
