The value N_{2} in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in clause 6.4, and N_{2} and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with configured grant and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH.

For operation in FR2-2, pucch-ResourceCommon can also provide a number of N_{R B} RBs for the PUCCH resource set; otherwise N_{R B}=1 . The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }} , and a cyclic shift index set for a PUCCH transmission.\n---\n\\end{table} For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource on the cell of the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 9-A, after determining a set of PUCCH resources for O_{\\text {UCI }} HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH. For PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell, and with ackNackFeedbackMode = joint for the active UL BWP, detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed prior to detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the second CORESETs. The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator field of 3 bits, provided by resourceList for PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used.\n---\nHARQ-ACK information and CSI report(s), the UE expects to be provided a same configuration for simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI each of PUCCH formats 2, 3, and 4. If a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a PUCCH resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each of the CSI reports indicates rank 1 . If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, the UE is configured to multiplex different UCI types in one PUCCH, and at least one of the multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all corresponding UCI types if the following conditions are met. If one of the PUCCH transmissions or PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE expects that the first symbol S_{0} of the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH, among a group overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in the slot, satisfies the following timeline conditions\n---\n9.2.5.2 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK/SR/CSI in a PUCCH For a transmission occasion of a single CSI report, a PUCCH resource is provided by pucch-CSI-ResourceList. For a transmission occasion of multiple CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by multi-CSI-PUCCHResourceList. If a UE is provided first and second PUCCH-Config, multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList is provided by the first PUCCH-Config, and PUCCH-Resourceld in pucch-CSI-ResourceList or multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList indicates a corresponding PUCCH resource in PUCCH-Resource provided by the first PUCCH-Config- If a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in response to a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, the UE does not expect to be provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI.\n---\nthe UE - determines - a PUCCH resource set from the second PUCCH-Config using O_{\\mathrm{UCI}}=O_{\\mathrm{ACK}, 0}+O_{\\mathrm{ACK}, 1} as described in clause 9.2.1, and a PUCCH resource from the PUCCH resource set as described in clause 9.2.3 where a DCI format, if any, triggers PUCCH transmission of priority 1 , or - a PUCCH resource from the second sps-PUCCH-AN-List using O_{\\mathrm{UCI}}=O_{\\mathrm{ACK} 0}+O_{\\mathrm{ACK} 1} as described in clause 9.2.1, and - multiplexes the O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 0} and O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1} HARQ-ACK information bits in a same PUCCH using the PUCCH resource.\n---\n9.2.5.4 UE procedure for deferring HARQ-ACK for SPS PDSCH If a UE is provided spsHARQdeferral and, after performing the procedures in clauses 9 and 9.2 .5 to resolve overlapping among PUCCHs and PUSCHs in a first slot, if any, the UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with first HARQ-ACK information bits for SPS PDSCH receptions that the UE would report for a first time, and the PUCCH resource - is provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List as described in clause 9.2.1, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided - is not cancelled by an overlapping PUCCH or PUSCH transmission of larger priority index\n---\nWith reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions and for a number of PSFCH reception occasions ending in slot n , the UE provides the generated HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot n+k , subject to the overlapping conditions in clause 9.2.5, where k is a number of slots indicated by a PSFCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format indicating a slot for PUCCH transmission to report the HARQ-ACK information, or k is provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH for a transmission scheduled by a DCI format or for a SL configured grant type 2, or by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel for a SL configured grant type 1. k=0 corresponds to a last slot for a PUCCH transmission that would overlap with the last PSFCH reception occasion assuming that the start of the sidelink frame is same as the start of the downlink frame [4, TS 38.211]. For a PSSCH transmission by a UE that is scheduled by a DCI format, or for a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission activated by a DCI format, the DCI format indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, the DCI format activating the SL configured grant Type 2 indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 1 PSSCH transmission, a PUCCH resource can be provided by sl-NIPUCCH-AN and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel. For transmission of HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, a UE can be provided a PUCCH resource by sl-NIPUCCH-AN-Type2. If a PUCCH resource is not provided, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH with generated HARQ-ACK information from PSFCH reception occasions. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources from up to four PUCCH resource sets provided by sl-PUCCH-Config, for O_{U C I} HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212] in a last DCI format 3_0, among the DCI formats 3 \\_0 that have a value of a PSFCH-toHARQ_feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes.",
