Configuration of a bandwidth part is described in clause 12 of [5, TS 38.213]. A UE can be configured with up to four bandwidth parts in the downlink with a single downlink bandwidth part being active at a given time. The UE is not expected to receive PDSCH, PDCCH, or CSI-RS (except for RRM) outside an active band width part.\n---\n- m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 except for PUCCH format 0 when it depends on the information to be transmitted according to clause 9.2 of [5, TS 38.213]. - m_{\\text {int }} is given by - m_{\\text {int }}=5 n_{\\text {IRB }}^{\\mu} for PUCCH formats 0 and 1 if PUCCH shall use interlaced mapping according to any of the higher-layer parameters uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon or uselnterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated, where n_{1 \\mathrm{RB}}^{\\mu} is the resource block number within the interlace; - m_{\\text {int }}=0 otherwise\n---\n- The reference point for k_{0}^{\\left(p_{i}\\right)}=0 is the lowest subcarrier of the configured bandwidth for SRS with Tx hopping configured by the parameter XXX in TxhoppingBandwidth. otherwise: - If N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\mathrm{start}} \\leq n_{\\text {shift }} the reference point for k_{0}^{\\left(p_{i}\\right)}=0 is subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 , otherwise the reference point is the lowest subcarrier of the BWP.

When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch and/or sfnSchemePdcch, the UE shall expect that the sfnSchemePdsch and/or sfnSchemePdcch configuration are the same in all DL BWP within a CC other than initial BWP, and the UE shall ETSI\n---\nIf a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH, the UE does not expect to be configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber in pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17. If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE does not apply pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-config, if configured, to DCI format 1_1 on the DL BWP of the serving cell. If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r I 7 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, when any two DL DCIs end in the same symbol and at least one of the DCIs schedules multiple PDSCHs, the UE does not expect that the scheduled PDSCH(s) by the two DCIs have overlapping spans, where the span associated with a DCI is defined from the beginning of the first scheduled PDSCH or up to the end of the last scheduled PDSCH.\n---\nresourceAllocationDCI-1-2 for DCI format 1 _2 or by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast for DCI format 4_2. If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1 \\_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format 1 \\_0 , the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.\n---\n\\] where L_{R B s} \\geq 1 and shall not exceed N_{B W P}^{s i z e}-R B_{\\text {start }} .
