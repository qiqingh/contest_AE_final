    "evidence": "the duration of periodicityAndPattern in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2). The rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuration in numerology \\mu applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology \\mu . - within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2).\n---\nIf a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2 \\_0 , provided to a UE for the search space set S by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 \\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot.\n---\nNumber of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The UE ignores this field for DCI format 2 \\_0 . The maximum valid duration is periodicity- 1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).\n---\n- within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2).\n---\nThe first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.\n---\nThis parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.\n---\nConfigures the duration of the reference time region in symbols where a detected UL CI is applicable of this serving cell (servingCellId) (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A). If the field is absent, i.e., the configured UL CI monitoring periodicity indicated by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset for DCI format 2_4 is larger than 1 slot or 1 slot with only one monitoring occasion, the UE applies the value of the configured UL CI monitoring periodicity,",
