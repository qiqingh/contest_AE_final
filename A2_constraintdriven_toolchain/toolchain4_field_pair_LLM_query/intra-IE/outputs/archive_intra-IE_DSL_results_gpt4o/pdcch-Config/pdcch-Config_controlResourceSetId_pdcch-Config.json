    "evidence": "- Each RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS configuration contains v-Shift consisting of LTE-CRS-vshift(s), nrofCRS-Ports consisting of LTE-CRS antenna ports 1, 2 or 4 ports, carrierFreqDL representing the offset in units of 15 kHz subcarriers from (reference) point A to the LTE carrier centre subcarrier location, carrierBandwidthDL representing the LTE carrier bandwidth, and may also configure mbsfn-SubframeConfigList representing MBSFN subframe configuration. A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe. - If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:\n---\n- If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:\n---\nIf the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI] and with PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE receives an activation command for CORESET associated with each coresetPoollndex, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in one CC/DL BWP. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID.\n---\n- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the qcl-Type is set to 'typeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers). - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets,\n---\nThe IE PDCCH-Config is used to configure UE specific or MBS multicast PDCCH parameters such as control resource sets (CORESET), search spaces and additional parameters for acquiring the PDCCH. If this IE is used for the scheduled SCell in case of cross carrier scheduling, the fields other than searchSpacesToAddModList and searchSpacesToReleaseList are absent. If the IE is used for a dormant BWP, the fields other than controlResourceSetToAddModList and controlResourceSetToReleaseList are absent. If this IE is used for MBS CFR, the field downlinkPreemptiom,tpc-PUSCH, tpc-SRS, uplinkCancellation, monitoringCapabilityConfig, and searchSpaceSwitchConfig are absent.\n---\ncontrolResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon. The network shall not use same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSetExt configured via SIB20 in this field.",
