    "evidence": "For downlink, a maximum of 16 HARQ processes per cell are supported by the UE, or subject to UE capability, a maximum of 32 HARQ processes per cell as defined in [13, TS 38.306]. The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used for the downlink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by higher layer parameter nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH, and when no configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 8 processes. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,4 \\_0,4 \\_1,4 \\_2 or 1 \\_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the ETSI\n---\n- For the UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes for broadcast reception, REs indicated by 'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS' in PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MCCH configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for PDSCH. - Each RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS configuration contains v-Shift consisting of LTE-CRS-vshift(s), nrofCRS-Ports consisting of LTE-CRS antenna ports 1, 2 or 4 ports, carrierFreqDL representing the offset in units of 15 kHz subcarriers from (reference) point A to the LTE carrier centre subcarrier location, carrierBandwidthDL representing the LTE carrier bandwidth, and may also configure mbsfn-SubframeConfigList representing MBSFN subframe configuration. A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe. - If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH: - if the UE is configured with crs-RateMatch-PerCoresetPoollndex, REs indicated by the CRS pattern(s) in Ite-CRS-PatternList 1-r16 if the PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 0 ', or the CRS pattern(s) in lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16 if PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 1 '; - otherwise, REs indicated by lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16 and lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16, in ServingCellConfig-\n---\nIf a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is receiving a DCI carrying the TCI-State indication and without DL assignment, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 by the DCI is more than one. If the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI] and with PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE receives an activation command for CORESET associated with each coresetPoollndex, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in one CC/DL BWP. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When a UE supports two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' the UE may receive an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.24 of [10, TS 38.321], the activation command is used to map up to 8 combinations of one or two TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'. The UE is not expected to receive more than 8 TCI states in the activation command.\n---\nIf at least one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states and the UE receives the DM-RS for PDSCH and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable. If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in different ControlResourceSets, and the UE receives the DM-RS for \\mathrm{PDSCH}(\\mathrm{s}) and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH(s) and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable. If a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may be scheduled with fully or partially overlapping PDSCHs in the time and frequency domain by multiple PDCCHs with the following restrictions,\n---\n- For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi co-location type(s), as described in clause 5.1.5, through higher layer signaling of qcl-info which contains a list of references to TCIState's for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the CSI triggering state. If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. - If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], when the reported value is one of the values of \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, or is smaller than 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16, enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameter repetition, or is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on'. - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet - if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoolIndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48. 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} when the reported value of beamSwitchTiming-r 16 is one of the values \\{224,336\\} . 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}{ }^{-3}\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS; - else, the UE applies the QCL parameter(s) of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld among CORESETs, which are configured with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic CSI-RS, in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs are associated with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic CSI-RS\n---\nFor a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 , the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format 0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 . When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i , the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol i , the UE can be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol i .\n---\n- a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell of the MCG configured by - pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or by searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon or by searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI, or - searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon when pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH are not provided, for a DCI format 4 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI - a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format 1 _ 0 with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG - a Type0B-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config M T C H for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, on the primary cell of the MCG\n---\n- PDSCH for MCCH or MTCH and PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI or by P-RNTI A UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by a first or second P U C C H -Config, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast PDCCH or PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN or SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook or pdsch-HARQ-ACKCodebookList, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for HARQ-ACK codebooks associated with multicast HARQ-ACK information is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].\n---\nPDCCH-OfSpcell & The field is mandatory present if the PUCCH-TPC-CommandConfig is provided in the PDCCH-Config for the SpCell.

Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol i is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than N symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of N depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\mu with N=13 for \\mu=0, N=13 for \\mu=1, N=20 for \\mu=2, N=24 for \\mu=3, N=96 for \\mu=5 , and N=192 for \\mu=6 . When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.\n---\nFor UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes, it is not expected to support reception of FDMed MCCH PDSCH and MTCH PDSCH, or FDMed multiple MTCH PDSCHs, or FDMed MCCH/MTCH PDSCH and SIB PDSCH in Pcell that partially or fully overlap in time in non-overlapping PRBs. If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex. For a ControlResourceSet without coresetPoollndex, the UE may assume that the ControlResourceSet is assigned with coresetPoollndex as 0 . When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], ControlResourceSets corresponding to different coresetPoolIndex values may be associated with different physical cell [Ds via activated TCI states of the ControlResourceSets, where ControlResourceSets corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and ControlResourceSets corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, the following operations are allowed: - For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol i , the UE can be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol i . - In a given scheduled cell, the UE can receive a first PDSCH in slot i , with the corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in slot j , and a second PDSCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex different from that of the first PDSCH starting later than the first PDSCH with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in a slot before slot j .\n---\nIndependent of the configuration of tci-PresentInDCI and tci-PresentDCI-1-2 in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL and at least one configured TCI state for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains qci-Type set to 'typeD', - the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the qcl-Type is set to 'typeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers). - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets, - the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH associated with a value of coresetPoolIndex of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi",
