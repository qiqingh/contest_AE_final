    "evidence": "The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K \\geq 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with K \\geq 1 SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.\n---\n- when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot n , the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set.\n---\nThe IE SCellActivationRS-Config is used to configure a Reference Signal for efficient activation of the SCell where the IE is included (see TS 38.214 [19], clause x.y.z). Usage of an SCellActivationRS-Config is indicated by including its scellActivationRS-Id in the Enhanced SCell activation MAC CE (see TS 38.321 [3] clause 6.1.3.55).",
