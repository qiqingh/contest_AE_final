When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'staticBundling', the P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} value is configured with the single value indicated by the higher layer parameter bundleSize. When a UE is configured with nominal RBG size P=2 for bandwidth part i according to Clause 5.1.2.2.1, or when a UE is configured with interleaving unit of 2 for VRB to PRB mapping provided by the higher layer parameter vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config for band width part i , the UE is not expected to be configured with P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime}= 4.\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} prb-BundlingType, prb-BundlingTypeDCI-1-2 Indicates the PRB bundle type and bundle size(s) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.3).

Constraints on bundleSize(Set) setting depending on vrb-ToPRB-Interleaverand mg-Size settings are described in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.3.
