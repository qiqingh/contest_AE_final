The starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted are given by the higher-layer parameters freqBand and density in the CSI-RSResourceMapping [E for the bandwidth part given by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig IE or given by the higher-layer parameters nrofPRBs in the CSI-RS-CellMobility [E where the the startPRB given by csi r s -Measurement B W is relative to common resource block 0 . For NZP CSI-RS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the CSI-RS can be transmitted are given by the higherlayer parameters nrofRBs, and startingRB in the TRS-ResourceSet [E, where startingRB is relative to common resource block 0 and the density \\rho=3 .\n---\nThe band width and initial common resource block (CRB) index of a CSI-RS resource within a BWP, as defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], are determined based on the higher layer parameters nrofRBs and startingRB, respectively, within the CSI-FrequencyOccupation IE configured by the higher layer parameter freqBand within the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E. Both nrofRBs and startingRB are configured as integer multiples of 4 RBs , and the reference point for starting R B is CRB 0 on the common resource block grid. If starting R B<N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , the UE shall assume that the initial CRB index of the CSI-RS resource is N_{\\text {initial } R B}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }} , otherwise N_{\\text {initial } R B}= startingRB. If nrofRBs >N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial RB }} , the UE shall assume that the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource is N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=N_{B W P}^{\\text {size }}+N_{B W P}^{\\text {start }}-N_{\\text {initial } R B} , otherwise N_{C S I-R S}^{B W}=n r o f R B s .
