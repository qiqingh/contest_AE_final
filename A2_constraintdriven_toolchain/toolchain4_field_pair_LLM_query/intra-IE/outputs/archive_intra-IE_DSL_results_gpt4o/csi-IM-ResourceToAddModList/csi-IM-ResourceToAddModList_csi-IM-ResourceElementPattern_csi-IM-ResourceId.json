If the IM field is set to 1 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is present. If IM field is set to 0 , the octet containing SP CSI-IM resource set ID field is not present;\n---\nThe time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.\n---\nIf a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic.\n---\n- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI ', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-SINR', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index', and K_{s}>1 resources are configured in the corresponding resource set for channel measurement, then the UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI conditioned on the reported CRI, where CRI k(k \\geq 0) corresponds to the configured ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet for channel measurement, and ( k+1 )-th entry of associated csi-IM-Resource in the corresponding csi-IMResourceSet (if configured) or ( k+1 )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet (if configured for CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR' or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set][ndex') for interference measurement. If K_{s}=2 \\mathrm{CSI} -RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS ports. If 2<K_{s} \\leq 8 CSI-RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 8 CSI-RS ports.\n---\nIf the UE has an active semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource configuration, or an active semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration, and has not received a deactivation command, the activated semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set or the activated semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configurations are considered to be active when the corresponding DL BWP is active, otherwise they are considered suspended.\n---\nIf the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements is set to \"notConfigured\", the UE shall derive the interference measurements for computing CSI value reported in uplink slot n based on only the CSI-IM and/or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement no later than the CSI reference resource associated with the CSI resource setting.\n---\n- resource elements \\left(k_{C S I-M}, l_{C S I-M}\\right),\\left(k_{C S I-M}+1, l_{C S I-M}\\right),\\left(k_{C S I-M}+2, l_{C S I-M}\\right) and \\left(k_{C S I-M}+3, l_{C S-I M}\\right) if csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern is set to 'pattern1',\n---\nCSI-IM-ForInterference & This field is mandatory present if the CSI-ReportConfig identified by reportConfigld is configured with csi-IMResourcesForinterference; otherwise it is absent.\n---\n- SP CSI-IM resource set ID: This field contains an index of CSI-IM-ResourceSet containing Semi Persistent CSIIM resources, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the Semi Persistent CSI-[M resource set, which shall be activated or deactivated.
