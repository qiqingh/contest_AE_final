When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], if the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH with mapping Type A were received in the same slot as the PDSCH, both PDCCH candidates are expected to be contained within the first three symbols of the slot.

The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset K_{2} , the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol S and the allocation length L , the PUSCH mapping type, the number of slots used for TBS determination (if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present in the resource allocation table), and the number of repetitions (if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission. ETSI\n---\n6.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain The UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is determined according to clause 8.3 of [6,38.213] or a MsgA PUSCH transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined according to clause 8.1A of [6,38.213]. Three uplink resource allocation schemes type 0 , type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 0 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format 0 \\_1 or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format 0 \\_2 . The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0 \\_1 and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\nIf N_{B W P}^{\\text {active }}>N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }}, K is the maximum value from set \\{1,2,4,8\\} which satisfies K \\leq\\left\\lfloor N_{B W P}^{\\text {active }} / N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }}\\right\\rfloor ; otherwise K=1 .

Within the active UL BWP, the assigned physical resource block n is mapped to virtual resource block n . For DCI 0 \\_0 monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and the union of the indicated set of RB sets and intra-cell guard bands defined in Clause 7 between the indicated RB sets, if any. For DCI 00 monitored in a common search space, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and a single uplink RB set of the active UL BWP. For DCI 0 \\_0 monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the lowest indexed one amongst uplink RB set(s) that intersects the lowest-indexed CCE of the PDCCH in which the UE detects the DCI 0 \\_0 in the active downlink BWP . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the uplink RB set of a PUSCH when scheduled by DCI 0 \\_0 monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. If there is no intersection, the uplink RB set is RB set 0 in the active uplink BWP. For DCI 0-0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the same one in which the UE transmits the PRACH associated with the RAR UL grant, in which case the UE assumes that the uplink RB set is defined as when the UE is not configured with intraCellGuardBandsUL-List (see Clause 7). For \\mu=0 , the X=6 MSBs of the resource block assignment information indicates to a UE a set of allocated interlace indices m_{0}+l , where the indication consists of a resource indication value ( R I V ). For 0 \\leq R I V<M(M+1) / 2 , l= 0,1, \\cdots L-1 the resource indication value corresponds to the starting interlace index m_{0} and the number of contiguous interlace indices L(L \\geq 1) . The resource indication value is defined by:\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) DCI format 0_1 for a given resource allocation type indicated by resourceAllocation, except if uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, in which case uplink type 2 resource allocation is used wherein the UE interprets the LSB bits in the higher layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation as for the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI 0_1 according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.2.2.3; - The I_{M C S} is provided by higher layer parameter mcsAndTBS; - Number of DM-RS CDM groups, DM-RS ports, SRS resource indication and DM-RS sequence initialization are determined as in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], and the antenna port value, the bit value for DM-RS sequence initialization, precoding information and number of layers, SRS resource indicator are provided by antennaPort, dmrs-SeqInitialization, precodingAndNumberOfLayers, and srs-ResourceIndicator respectively; When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2, precoding information and number of layers (applicable when higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook') associated with the first and second SRS resource set is provided by precodingAndNumberOfLayers and precodingAndNumberOfLayers2, respectively, and SRS resource indicators associated with the first and second SRS resource sets are provided by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2, respectively. When both srsResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 are configured with two SRS resource sets, the two SRS resource sets configured by srs-ResourceSetToAddModList is used to determine the SRS resource indications by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2.\n---\nIn case of resource allocation type 1, whether or not transform precoding is enabled for PUSCH transmission, the UE may perform PUSCH frequency hopping, if the frequency hopping field in a corresponding detected DCI format or in a random access response UL grant is set to 1 , or if for a Type 1 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffset is provided, otherwise no PUSCH frequency hopping is performed. When frequency hopping is enabled for PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of [4, TS 38.211]. For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or by DCI format 0 \\_0 with CRC scrambled by TCRNTI, frequency offsets are obtained as described in clause 8.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. Otherwise, for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 and for resource allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_2 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_2 and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config. - When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant. - When the size of the active BWP is equal to or greater than 50 PRBs, one of four higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.\n---\n- end if If uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH is provided by BWP-UplinkCommon or BWP-UplinkDedicated, the frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource allocation type 2 [6, TS 38.214].
