Otherwise the UE shall use the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config for DCI format 1 \\_1 or by the higher layer parameter\n---\nIn downlink resource allocation of type 0 , the resource block assignment information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups (RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter rbg-Size configured by PDSCH-Config and the size of the bandwidth part as defined in Table 5.1.2.2.1-1.\n---\nIn downlink resource allocation of type 0 scheduled using a DCI with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the resource block assignment information bitmap is calculated based on the description above with the following changes: the parameter N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {start }} is the starting PRB of the CFR, N_{B W P, i}^{\\text {size }} is the size of the common frequency resource (CFR) and the value of the higher layer parameter rbg-Size is configured by PDSCH-Config-Multicast.",
