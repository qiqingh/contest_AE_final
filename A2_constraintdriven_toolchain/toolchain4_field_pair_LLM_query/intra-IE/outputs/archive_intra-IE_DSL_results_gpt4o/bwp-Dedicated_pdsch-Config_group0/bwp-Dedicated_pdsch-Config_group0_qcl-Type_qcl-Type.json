Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Typel for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type 2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread\\} - 'typeB': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\}\n---\nA UE configured with NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info may have the CSIRS resources configured as: - Periodic, with the CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with same periodicity, band width and subcarrier location. - Periodic CSI-RS resource in one set and aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a second set, with the aperiodic CSI-RS and periodic CSI-RS resource having the same bandwidth (with same RB location) and the aperiodic CSI-RS being configured with qcl-Type set to 'type A' and 'typeD', where applicable, with the periodic CSI-RS resources.

The UE shall expect that the periodic CSI-RS resource set and aperiodic CSI-RS resource set are configured with the same number of CSI-RS resources and with the same number of CSI-RS resources in a slot. For the aperiodic CSI-RS resource set if triggered, and if the associated periodic CSI-RS resource set is configured with four periodic CSIRS resources with two consecutive slots with two periodic CSI-RS resources in each slot, the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset indicates the triggering offset for the first slot for the first two CSI-RS resources in the set.

If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. - If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], when the reported value is one of the values of \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, or is smaller than 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16, enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameter repetition, or is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on'. - If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet\n---\nFor a UE configured with CSI resource setting(s) where the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'semiPersistent'. - when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.12 of [10, TS 38.321], for CSI-RS resource set(s) for channel measurement and CSI-[M/NZP CSI-RS resource set(s) for interference measurement associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the selection command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions (including QCL assumptions provided by a list of reference to TCI-State's, one per activated resource) on CSI-RS/CSI-[M transmission corresponding to the configured CSI-RS/CSI-[Mresource configuration(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+ 3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }, \\mu}+\\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K}}{ }^{\\text {rac }}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{\\text {mac }} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\text {mac }} is provided by K-M a c or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K-M a c is not provided.

If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell. - trs-Info in NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is associated with a CSI-RS resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1 and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when the higher layer parameter reportQuantity associated with all the reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to 'none'.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is not configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, snischemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0 \\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPLFor PUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP where all the PUCCH resource(s) are not configured with any spatial relation and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell in case CORESET(s) are configured on the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, sfnSchemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption. For uplink, 16 HARQ processes per cell are supported by the UE, or subject to UE capability, a maximum of 32 HARQ processes per cell as defined in [13, TS 38.306]. The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used for the uplink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by higher layer parameter nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH, and when no configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 16 processes.\n---\nFor non-codebook based transmission, the UE can calculate the precoder used for the transmission of SRS based on measurement of an associated NZP CSI-RS resource. A UE can be configured with only one NZP CSI-RS resource for the SRS resource set with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' if configured. - If aperiodic SRS resource set is configured, the associated NZP-CSI-RS is indicated via SRS request field in DCI format 0 \\_1 and 1 \\_1 , as well as DCI format 0 \\_2 (if SRS request field is present) and DCI format 1 \\_2 (if SRS request field is present), where AperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger and AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList (indicating the association between aperiodic SRS triggering state(s) and SRS resource sets), triggered SRS resource(s) srs-ResourceSetId, csi-RS (indicating the associated NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId) are higher layer configured in SRS-ResourceSet. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format 0 \\_1 and 1_1 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and the SRSResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format 0 \\_2 and 1 \\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2.

If UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in the active DL BWP and the currently applicable minimum scheduling offset restriction K_{0, m i n} is larger than 0 , the UE does not expected to receive the scheduling DCI with the SRS request field value other than ' 00 '. The CSI-RS is located in the same slot as the SRS request field. If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, any of the TCI states configured in the scheduled CC shall not be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD'. - If periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource set is configured, the NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld for measurement is indicated via higher layer parameter associatedCSI-RS in SRS-ResourceSet.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321].

The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. For aperiodic SRS at least one state of the DCI field is used to select at least one out of the configured SRS resource set(s).\n---\nIf the UE is not provided RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided for PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS - the UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH reception if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes only one RS - if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qclType set to 'typeD' [6, TS 38.214] and the UE uses the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for radio link monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' - the UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic or semi-persistent RS - For L_{\\text {max }}=4 , the UE selects the N_{\\text {RLM }} RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in CORESETs associated with the search space sets in an order from the shortest monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in clause 10.1.\n---\nIf a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index q_{\\text {new }} is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower. If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasicollocated with as described in clause 10.1, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index q_{\\text {new }} is associated with a periodic CSI-RS configuration as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is obtained by ss-PBCH-BlockPower and powerControlOffsetSS where powerControlOffsetSS provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB . If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' and the UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by power ControlOffsetSS. If within a random access response window, as described in clause 8.2, the UE does not receive a random access response that contains a preamble identifier corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted by the UE, the UE determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH transmission, if any, as described in [11, TS 38.321].\n---\n- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in multiple CORESETs that have been configured with same or different qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties on active DL BWP(s) of one or more cells, and - is provided two-QCLTypeDforPDCCHRepetition the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a first CORESET with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties and, if any, in a second CORESET with qcl-Type set to second 'typeD' properties that are different than the first 'typeD' properties, and in any other CORESET from the multiple CORESETs with corresponding qcl-Type set to the first 'typeD' properties and/or to the second 'typeD' properties - the first CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS sets, if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index - excluding CSS sets and USS sets associated with CORESETs with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties, the second CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS sets; if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index, where the CSS set or the USS set includes searchSpaceLinking with a value indicating, respectively, any CSS set or any USS set associated with CORESETs with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties\n---\nWhen the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' is present in DCI format 1 \\_2 and when the number of codepoints S in the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' of DCI format 1 \\_2 is smaller than the number of TCI codepoints that are activated by the activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 and 6.1.3.24 of [10, TS38.321], only the first S activated codepoints are applied for DCI format 1 \\_2 . When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subrame, } \\mu}+ \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K} a c}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} is the subcarrier spacing configuration for k_{\\text {mac }} with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and k_{\\text {mac }} is provided by K -Mac or k_{\\text {mac }}=0 if K -Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'. If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter tci-PresentInDCI that is set as 'enabled' for the CORESET scheduling a PDSCH, the UE assumes that the TCI field is present in the DCI format 1 \\_1 of the PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET. If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter tci-PresentDCI-1-2 for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, the UE assumes that the TCI field with a DCI field size indicated by tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is present in the DCI format 1_2 of the PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET. If the PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format not having the TCI field present, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306], for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location, the UE assumes that",
