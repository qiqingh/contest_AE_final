If no mapping scheme is indicated, the UE shall assume noninterleaved mapping. For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n , except for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format 1 \\_0 in a common search space in which case virtual resource block n is mapped to physical resource block n+N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {COREST }} where N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} is the lowest-numbered physical resource block in the control resource set where the corresponding DCI was received. When two PDCCH candidates from two linked common search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked common search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} . For interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, the mapping process is defined by:\n---\nFor downlink, a maximum of 16 HARQ processes per cell are supported by the UE, or subject to UE capability, a maximum of 32 HARQ processes per cell as defined in [13, TS 38.306]. The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used for the downlink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by higher layer parameter nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH, and when no configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 8 processes. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,4 \\_0,4 \\_1,4 \\_2 or 1 \\_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the ETSI\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) symbol S is relative to the starting symbol S_{0} of the PDCCH monitoring occasion where DCI format 1 \\_2 is detected; when the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time is used for the purpose of determining the starting symbol S_{0} ; - otherwise, the starting symbol S is relative to the start of the slot using S_{0}=0 . - The number of consecutive symbols L counting from the starting symbol S allocated for the PDSCH are determined from the start and length indicator SLIV:\n---\n5.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1 , are supported. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1 \\_0,4 \\_0 or 4 \\_1 then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource assignment' field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format 1 \\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-1-2 in PDSCH-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 1 _2 or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 4_2, the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-Config for DCI format 1 \\_1 or by the higher layer parameter\n---\n5.1.2.2.2 Downlink resource allocation type 1 In downlink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated non-interleaved or interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part of size N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} PRBs except for the case when DCI format 1_0 is decoded in any common search space in which case the size of CORESET 0 shall be used if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell and the size of initial DL bandwidth part shall be used if CORESET 0 is not configured for the cell. ETSI\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) A downlink type 1 resource block assignment field in the DCI format 4 \\_0 or DCI format 4 \\_1 consists of a RIV corresponding to a starting resource block in reference to the lowest RB of the CFR R B_{\\text {start }}=0, K, 2 \\cdot K, \\ldots,\\left(N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }}-1\\right) \\cdot K and a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource blocks \\mathrm{L}_{R B s} , where N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }} is given by - the size of CORESET 0 if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell; - the size of initial DL band width part if CORESET 0 is not configured for the cell.\n---\nIf a UE is scheduled a PDSCH with DCI format 1 \\_0 or 4 \\_0 , the UE shall assume that P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} is equal to 2 PRBs. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} for bandwidth part is equal to 2 PRBs unless configured by the higher layer parameter prbBundlingType given by PDSCH-Config. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'dynamicBundling', the higher layer parameters bundleSizeSet 1 and bundleSizeSet 2 configure two sets of P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} values, the first set can take one or two P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} values among \\{2,4 , wideband \\} , and the second set can take one P_{B W P, i}^{\\prime} value among \\{2,4 , wideband \\} .\n---\nFor the PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1 \\_0 , format 1 \\_1 , format 1 \\_2 , format 4 \\_0 , format 4 \\_1 or format 4 \\_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, TC-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or P-RNTI, or for the PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmissions using the higher-layer-provided PDSCH configuration SPS-Config or SPS-Config-Multicast, if the higher layer parameter mcs-Table-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI - the UE shall use I_{M C S} and Table 5.1.3.1-4 to determine the modulation order ( Q_{m} ) and Target code rate ( R ) used in the physical downlink shared channel. elseif mcs-TableDCI-1-2-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI\n---\n5.1.3.2 Transport block size determination In case the higher layer parameter maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI indicates that two codeword transmission is enabled, then one of the two transport blocks is disabled by DCI format 1 \\_1 if I_{M C S}=26 and if r v_{\\text {id }}=1 for the corresponding transport block. When the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17], either the first or the second transport block of all scheduled PDSCHs is disabled by the DCI format 1 \\_1 if I_{M C S}=26 and if r v_{i d}=2 for the corresponding transport block of all scheduled PDSCHs. If both transport blocks are enabled, transport block 1 and 2 are mapped to codeword 0 and 1 respectively. If only one transport block is enabled, then the enabled transport block is always mapped to the first codeword.
