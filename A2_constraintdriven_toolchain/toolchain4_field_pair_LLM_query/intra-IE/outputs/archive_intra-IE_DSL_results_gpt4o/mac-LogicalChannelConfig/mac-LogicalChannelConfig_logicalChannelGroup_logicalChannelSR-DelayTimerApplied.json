If an RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer, it receives them through a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer, and after forming RLC data PDUs from the received RLC SDUs, the RLC entity submits the RLC data PDUs to lower layer through a single logical channel. If an RLC entity receives RLC data PDUs from lower layer, it receives them through a single logical channel, and after forming RLC SDUs from the received RLC data PDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC SDUs to upper layer through a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer.

Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or a DSR (clause 5.4.9) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request (clause 5.25 ) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR.
