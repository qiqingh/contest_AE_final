When the higher layer parameter repetition is set to 'on', CRI is not reported. CRI reporting is not supported when the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', to 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. For a periodic or semi-persistent CSI report on PUCCH, the periodicity T_{C S I} (measured in slots) and the slot offset T_{\\text {offset }} are configured by the higher layer parameter reportSlotConfig. Unless specified otherwise, the UE shall transmit the CSI report in frames with SFN n_{f} and slot number within the frame n_{s, f}^{\\mu} satisfying\n---\n- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.

If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources. An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with 2 \\leq K_{s} \\leq 8 resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with K_{1} \\geq 1 resources in Group 1 and K_{2} \\geq 1 resources in Group 2, such that K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} , and with N \\in\\{1,2\\} Resource Pairs.

Part 1 has a fixed payload size and is used to identify the number of information bits in Part 2. Part 1 shall be transmitted in its entirety before Part 2. - For Type I CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword (if reported). Part 2 contains PMI (if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4. For a CSI-ReportConfig configured with codebookType set to 'typelSinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, Part 1 contains RI(s), CRI(s), CQI(s) for the first codeword and is zero padded to a fixed payload size (if needed). Part 2 contains the CQI(s) for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4, LIs (if reported) and PMI(s). - For Type II CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients per layer for the Type [I CSI (see Clause 5.2.2.2.3). The fields of Part 1 - RI (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients for each layer are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI and LI (if reported) of the Type [[] CSI. The elements of i_{1,4, l} , i_{2,1, l} (if reported) and i_{2,2, l} (if reported) are reported in the increasing order of their indices, i=0,1, \\ldots, 2 L-1 , where the element of the lowest index is mapped to the most significant bits and the element of the highest index is mapped to the least significant bits. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded. - For Enhanced Type [I CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5) and Further Enhanced Type [I Port Selection CSI feedback (see Clause 5.2.2.2.5), Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and an indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers. The fields of Part 1-\\mathrm{RI} (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients across layers - are separately encoded.

The activation command will contain one or more Reporting Settings where the associated CSI Resource Settings are configured. Semi-persistent CSI reporting on the PUCCH supports Type I CSI. Semi-persistent CSI reporting on the PUCCH format 2 supports Type I CSI with wideband frequency granularity. Semipersistent CSI reporting on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 supports Type I CSI with wideband and sub-band frequency granularities and Type [] CSI Part 1. When the PUCCH carry Type I CSI with wideband frequency granularity, the CSI payload carried by the PUCCH format 2 and PUCCH formats 3, or 4 are identical and the same irrespective of RI (if reported), CRI (if reported). A CSI-ReportConfig with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs can be configured with wideband frequency granularity only with csi-ReportMode set to 'Mode1' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model set to X=0 . For type I CSI sub-band reporting on PUCCH formats 3, or 4, the payload is split into two parts. The first part contains RI (if reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword. The second part contains PMI (if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second codeword (if reported) when RI >4 . For a CSI-ReportConfig configured with subband reporting, codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and N Resource Pairs, Part 1 contains RI(s), CRI(s), CQI(s) for the first codeword and is zero padded to a fixed payload size (if needed). Part 2 contains the CQI(s) for the second codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4, Lis (if reported) and PMI(s). A semi-persistent report carried on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 supports Type II CSI feedback, but only Part 1 of Type II CSI feedback (See Clause 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). Supporting Type II CSI reporting on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 is a UE capability type2-SP-CSI-Feedback-LongPUCCH. A Type II CSI report (Part 1 only) carried on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 shall be calculated independently of any Type II CSI reports carried on the PUSCH (see Clause 5.2.3).\n---\nETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05) corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5-4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where CodebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', or - \\left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) of the table 5.4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the reportQuantity is set to 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index ', or\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} supportedCSI-RS-ResourceListAIt This field indicates the alternative list of SupportedCS/-RS-Resource supported for each codebook type.
