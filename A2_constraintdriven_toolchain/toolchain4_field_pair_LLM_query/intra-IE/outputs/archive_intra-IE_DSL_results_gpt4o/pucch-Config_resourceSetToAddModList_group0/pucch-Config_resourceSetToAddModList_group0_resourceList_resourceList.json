If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used. For the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size R_{\\text {PUCCH }} of resourceList is larger than eight, when a UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a last DCI format in a PDCCH reception, among DCI formats with a value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index r_{\\text {PUCCH }}, 0 \\leq r_{\\text {PUCCH }} \\leq R_{\\text {PUCCH }}-1 , as ETSI\n---\n- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting - if the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2 and do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting - if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2. A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH.

For a transmission occasion of multiple CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by multi-CSI-PUCCHResourceList. If a UE is provided first and second PUCCH-Config, multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList is provided by the first PUCCH-Config, and PUCCH-Resourceld in pucch-CSI-ResourceList or multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList indicates a corresponding PUCCH resource in PUCCH-Resource provided by the first PUCCH-Config- If a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in response to a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, the UE does not expect to be provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI.\n---\nThe NCR Access Link Beam Indication MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a variable size and consists of the following fields (Figure 6.1.3.68-1): - Resource set ID: This field is used to indicate one of forwarding semi-persistent resource lists signalled in NCRSemiPersistentFwdResourceSet (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]). The field contains a list ID (comprising all 5 bits); - A/D: If the value of this field is set to 1 , the forwarding resource list indicated in Resource set ID field is being activated. If the value of this field is set to 0 , the forwarding resource list indicated in Resource set ID field is being deactivated; - C: If the value of this field is set to 1 , the Beam index ID, field is present. If the value of this field is set to 0 , the Beam index I D_{1} field is absent. This field can be set to 1 only if MAC CE is used for activation, i.e., when the A/D field is set to 1 . If MAC CE is used for deactivation, this field is set to 0 ; - Beam index \\left[D_{1}\\right. : This field indicates the updated beam index for forwarding resources within the list indicated by the Resource set ID field. Beam index ID0 indicates the beam index for the first forwarding resource within the list; Beam index \\left[D_{1}\\right. indicates the beam index for the second forwarding resource within the list and so on. The length of the field is 6 bits; the number of updated beams, N , is equal to the number of the beam indications in the semi-persistent resource set with ID Resource set ID;- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} additionalPCIList Indicates the physical cell IDs (PCI) of the SSBs in the csi-SSB-ResourceList.
