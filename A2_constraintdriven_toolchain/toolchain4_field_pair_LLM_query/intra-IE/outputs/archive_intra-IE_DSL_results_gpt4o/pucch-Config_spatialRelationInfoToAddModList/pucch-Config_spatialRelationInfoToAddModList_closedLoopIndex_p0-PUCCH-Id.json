If the UE receives an activation command indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the value closedLoopIndex that provides the value of l through the link to a corresponding p0-PUCCH-Id index\n---\n- if the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE determines the value of l from the value of q_{u} based on a pucch-SpatialRelationInfold value associated with the p0-PUCCH-Id value corresponding to q_{u} and with the closedLoopIndex value corresponding to l ;",
