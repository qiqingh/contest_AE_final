If Itm-CSI-ReportConfigToAddModList is not configured, R field is present instead (i.e. set to 0); - \\mathrm{S}_{1} : This field indicates the activation/deactivation status of the Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration within Itm-CSI-ReportConfigToAddModList if L field is set to 1 , or csi-ReportConfigToAddModList if L field is set to 0 , as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. \\mathrm{S}_{0} refers to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the lowest CSI-ReportConfigId or LTM-CSI-ReportConfigId within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH, \\mathrm{S}_{1} to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the second lowest CSI-ReportConfigId or LTM-CSIReportConfigId and so on. If the number of report configurations within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH in the indicated BWP is less than \\mathrm{i}+1 , MAC entity shall ignore the \\mathrm{S}_{1} field. The \\mathrm{S}_{1} field is set to 1 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration shall be activated. The S , field is set to 0 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration i shall be deactivated. If the Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration i is configured with csiReportSubConfigToAddModList, the \\mathrm{S}_{1} field is set to 0 to additionally indicate that all sub-configurations within csi-ReportSubConfigToAddModList shall be deactivated; - R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .\n---\n- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies.
