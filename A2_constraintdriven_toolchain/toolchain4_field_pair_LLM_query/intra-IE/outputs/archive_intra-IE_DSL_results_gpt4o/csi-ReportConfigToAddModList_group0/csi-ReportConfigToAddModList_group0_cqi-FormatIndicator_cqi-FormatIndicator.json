When wideband CQI reporting is configured, a wideband CQI is reported for each codeword for the entire CSI reporting band. When subband CQI reporting is configured, one CQI for each codeword is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band. - wideband PMI or subband PMI reporting as configured by the higher layer parameter pmi-FormatIndicator. When wideband PMI reporting is configured, a wideband PMI is reported for the entire CSI reporting band. When subband PMI reporting is configured, except with 2 antenna ports, a single wideband indication (i) in Clause 5.2.2.2) is reported for the entire CSI reporting band and one subband indication ( i_{2} in clause 5.2.2.2) is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band. When subband PMIs are configured with 2 antenna ports, a PMI is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band. - a UE is not expected to be configured with pmi-FormatIndicator if codebookType is set to 'type[I-r16' or 'type[I-PortSelection-r16' or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'.\n---\n\\begin{tabular}{l} cqi-BitsPerSubband This field can only be present if cqi-Formatindicator is set to subbandCQI.
