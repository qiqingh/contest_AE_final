    "evidence": "The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is S=2 , otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to S=1 . For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.\n---\n- the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the BWP switching shall be no later than the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the CSI trigger, irrespective of whether they are in the same carrier of a serving cell or not and irrespective of whether they are in the same SCS or not; - the UE is not expected to have any other BWP switching in that carrier after the last symbol of the PDCCH span covering the DCI carrying the CSI trigger and before the first symbol of the triggered NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM.\n---\nIf the UE has an active semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource configuration, or an active semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration, and has not received a deactivation command, the activated semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set or the activated semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configurations are considered to be active when the corresponding DL BWP is active, otherwise they are considered suspended.",
