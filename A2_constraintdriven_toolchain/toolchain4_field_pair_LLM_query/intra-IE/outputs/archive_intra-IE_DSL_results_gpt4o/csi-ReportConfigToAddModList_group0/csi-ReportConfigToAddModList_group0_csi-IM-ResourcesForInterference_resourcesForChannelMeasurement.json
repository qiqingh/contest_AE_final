For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.\n---\nA UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, M+N resources are configured in the corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet. The M resources for channel measurement defined above are resource-wise associated with the first M CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources in the corresponding Resource Set. The N Resource Pairs for channel measurement are associated to the last N CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS Resource Pairs and CSI-IM resources in the CSI-IM Resource Set. The UE may assume that the two CSI-RS resources for channel measurement in a Resource Pair and the associated CSI-IM resource for interference measurement are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'.",
