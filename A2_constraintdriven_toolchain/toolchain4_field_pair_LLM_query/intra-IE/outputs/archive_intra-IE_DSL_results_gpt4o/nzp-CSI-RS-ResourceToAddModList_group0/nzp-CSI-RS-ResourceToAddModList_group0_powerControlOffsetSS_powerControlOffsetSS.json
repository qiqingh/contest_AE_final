If the UE is configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided either by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or by powerControlOffsetSS providing an offset of the CSI-RS transmission power relative to the SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. [f powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB . - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=10 \\log _{10}\\left(\\left(2^{\\mathrm{BPRE} \\cdot K_{S}}-1\\right) \\cdot \\beta_{\\text {offset }}^{\\mathrm{PUSCH}}\\right) for K_{s}=1.25 and \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=0 for K_{s}=0 where K_{s} is provided by deltaMCS for each UL BWP b of each carrier f and serving cell c . If the PUSCH transmission is over more than one layer [6, \\mathrm{TS} 38.214], \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=0 . BPRE and \\beta_{\\mathrm{offset}}^{\\mathrm{PUSCH}} , for active UL BWP b of each carrier f and each serving cell c , are computed as below - BPRE =\\sum_{r=0}^{C-1} K_{r} / N_{R E} for PUSCH with UL-SCH data and BPRE =Q_{m} \\cdot R / \\beta_{\\text {offset }}^{\\text {PUSCH }} for CSI transmission in a PUSCH without UL-SCH data, where\n---\nIf a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index q_{\\text {new }} is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower. If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasicollocated with as described in clause 10.1, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index q_{\\text {new }} is associated with a periodic CSI-RS configuration as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is obtained by ss-PBCH-BlockPower and powerControlOffsetSS where powerControlOffsetSS provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB . If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' and the UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by power ControlOffsetSS. If within a random access response window, as described in clause 8.2, the UE does not receive a random access response that contains a preamble identifier corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted by the UE, the UE determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH transmission, if any, as described in [11, TS 38.321].",
