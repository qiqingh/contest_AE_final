    "evidence": "- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneous TCI-UpdateListl or simultaneous TCI-UpdateList2 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1 or simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2, respectively; - CORESET ID: This field indicates a Control Resource Set identified with ControlResourceSetld as specified in TS 38.331 [5], for which the TCI State is being indicated. In case the value of the field is 0 , the field refers to the Control Resource Set configured by controlResourceSetZero as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 4 bits; - TCI state IDi: This field indicates the TCI state identified by TCI-Stateld as specified in TS 38.331 [5] applicable to the Control Resource Set identified by CORESET ID field. If the field of CORESET ID is set to the other value than 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld configured by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID. The length of the field is 7 bits. NOTE 1: The Enhanced TCI State Indication for UE specific PDCCH MAC CE is not applicable to any of the configured CORESETs in a BWP if the CORESETs are configured with different CORESETPoolindex values in the BWP.\n---\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, as described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE does not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld. For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR, a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot n and according to antenna port quasi colocation parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with index q_{\\text {new }} provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot n+4+2^{\\mu} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} , where \\mu is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission and k_{\\text {mac }} is a number of slots provided by K-M a c[12, T S 38.331] or k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 if K-M a c is not provided, within a window configured by BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld and for corresponding PDSCH reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index q_{\\text {new }} until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList. After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList. For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of a first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for which the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and until the UE receives an activation command for PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo [11, TS 38.321] or is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo for PUCCH resource(s), the UE transmits a PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using\n---\nFor a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 , - if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET, or has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI states for the CORESET by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure, or for a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19 for a same HARQ process; - if a UE has been provided a configuration of more than one TCI states by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET as part of Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi colocated with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331].",
