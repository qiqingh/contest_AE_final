The constraint MUST relate field1 (from commoncontrolresourceset) to field2 (from commonsearchspacelist).\nIf evidence only describes single-IE behavior → NO_RULE\n\nStrict Rules:\n1) EVIDENCE-ONLY. Use ONLY the provided snippets. No external memory.\n2) NORMATIVE CHECK. Accept only constraints backed by explicit normative wording (shall/shall not/only/only if/must) OR explicit math/table relations. If wording is \"should\", mark advisory=true and still return NO_RULE unless a non-advisory relation also exists.\n3) INTER-IE SCOPE. The constraint MUST relate field1 (from commoncontrolresourceset) to field2 (from commonsearchspacelist). If evidence only describes single IE behavior, output NO_RULE.\n4) DIRECTION & TRIGGER. Identify the correct trigger condition(s) and avoid reversing implication.\n5) MACHINE-CHECKABLE. The DSL must use the canonical grammar below and be directly checkable (no vague words).\n6) UNITS & ENUMS. Normalize any required units or enum-to-number mapping explicitly (e.g., n1→1, n2→2). If unknown, output NO_RULE.\n7) VERSION/SCOPE GUARDS. If the rule only applies under specific releases/options, include them in `preconditions`.\n8) LOGICAL CONSISTENCY \n- Check for contradictions before outputting DSL\n- Verify constraint is logically feasible\n- If impossible or contradictory → NO_RULE\n\nAllowed Types and Canonical DSL Grammar:\n\nFor Inter-IE constraints, use field1 and field2 to refer to the two fields:\n\n- CrossReference (ID/reference matching):\n  - MATCH(field1, field2)          // IDs must match\n  - EQ(field1, field2)              // Values must be equal\n  \n- ValueDependency (value determines valid values):\n  - IMPLIES(EQ(field1, value), EQ(field2, value))\n  - IMPLIES(IN(field1, {v1,v2}), IN(field2, {v1,v2}))\n  - MAP(field1, field2, {a->b, c->d})\n  \n- RangeAlignment (coordinated ranges):\n  - IMPLIES(EQ(field1, X), AND(GE(field2, min), LE(field2, max)))\n  - LT(field1, field2) | LE(field1, field2) | GT(field1, field2) | GE(field1, field2)\n  \n- Association (logical association):\n  - ASSOCIATED(field1, field2, condition)\n  - IMPLIES(condition_on_field1, requirement_on_field2)\n  \n- Conditional (conditional constraints):\n  - CONDITIONAL(EQ(field1, X), action_on_field2)\n\nBasic Operators:\n- EQ(X,Y) | NE(X,Y)\n- IN(X,{v1,v2,...})\n- LT(X,Y) | LE(X,Y) | GT(X,Y) | GE(X,Y)\n- AND(...) | OR(...) | NOT(...)\n- IMPLIES(condition, result)\n- MATCH(field1, field2)\n\nOutput JSON ONLY:\n{\n  \"result\": \"DSL | NO_RULE\",\n  \"type\": \"CrossReference | ValueDependency | RangeAlignment | Association | Conditional\",\n  \"dsl\": \"formal DSL expression using operators above\",\n  \"preconditions\": [\"list any preconditions\"],\n  \"predicate\": \"human-readable predicate description\",\n  \"advisory\": false,\n  \"examples\": {\n    \"valid\": [\"concrete assignment example\"],\n    \"invalid\": [\"concrete assignment example\"]\n  },\n  \"notes\": \"1-2 lines explaining why NO_RULE or edge-guards\",\n  \"version_tags\": [\"r16\",\"r17\"]\n}\n\nDecision rules for NO_RULE:\n- Evidence lacks both target fields or doesn't relate them across IEs.\n- Evidence is purely definitional without cross-field relation.\n- Only 'should' guidance with no non-advisory constraint.\n- Requires external assumptions not present in evidence.\n- Evidence only describes single-IE behavior.\n\nExamples:\n\n1.
