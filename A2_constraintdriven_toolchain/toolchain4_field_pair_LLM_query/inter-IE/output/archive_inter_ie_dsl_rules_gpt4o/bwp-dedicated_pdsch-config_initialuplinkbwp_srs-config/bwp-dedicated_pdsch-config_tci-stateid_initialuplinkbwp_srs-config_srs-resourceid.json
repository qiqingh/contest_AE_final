If the value of the field is 01, the information included in the [AB-MT Resource set[D, field is the SSB ID (contained in the 6 rightmost bits of the field). If the value of the field is 10 , the information included in the [AB-MT Resource set [D, field is the CSI-RS index (comprising all 8 bits), which is the NZP-CSI-RSResourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If the value of the field is 11, the information included in the 6 rightmost bits in the [AB-MT Resource set [D, field is the SRS-ResourceID. The length of the field is 2 bits;\n---\n- Uplink TCI state ID or SRS Resource ID: This field is used to indicate the uplink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. If the dl-OrJointTCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and unifiedTCIStateType is configured with a value joint, this field contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits) of a Joint TCI State configured in the active DL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission. If the ul-TCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this field contains TCI-UL-State-Id (contained in the 6 rightmost bits) of an UL TCI State configured in the active UL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero. Otherwise, 6 rightmost bits of this field contain SRS-ResourceID configured in the active UL BWP which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero;",
