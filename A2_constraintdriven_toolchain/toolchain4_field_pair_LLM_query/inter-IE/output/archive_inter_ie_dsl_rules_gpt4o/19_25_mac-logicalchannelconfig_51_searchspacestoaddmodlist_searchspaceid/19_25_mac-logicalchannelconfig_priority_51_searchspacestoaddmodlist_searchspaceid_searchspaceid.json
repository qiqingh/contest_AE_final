A priority of a PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH according to E-UTRA radio access is provided by \\( s l \\)-SSB-PriorityEUTRA [13, TS 36.213]. A priority of an S-SS/PSBCH block is provided by \\( s l \\)-SSBPriorityNR.

The priority value of the PUCCH transmission is as described in clause 16.5.

Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than \\( N \\) symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of \\( N \\) depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\( \\mu \\) with \\( N=13 \\) for \\( \\mu=0, N=13 \\) for \\( \\mu=1, N=20 \\) for \\( \\mu=2, N=24 \\) for \\( \\mu=3, N=96 \\) for \\( \\mu=5 \\), and \\( N=192 \\) for \\( \\mu=6 \\).\n---\n- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH using a resource provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, and the PUCCH transmission is not dropped due to an overlapping with a PUSCH or PUCCH transmission of larger priority and does not have any symbol that overlaps with a symbol indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated, or indicated for a SS/PBCH block by ssbPositionsInBurst, or belonging to a CORESET associated with a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot\n---\nA PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has higher priority than a PSFCH/SSS/PSBCH block reception if a priority value of the PUCCH is smaller than a priority value of the SL reception.
