If the field of CORESET ID is set to 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld for a TCI state of the first 64 TCI-states configured by tci-StatesToAddModList and tciStatesToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or by dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToAddModList and dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or the reference BWP. If the field of CORESET ID is set to the other value than 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld configured by tci-StatesPDCCHToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID. The length of the field is 7 bits.\n---\nA UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].\n---\n- rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by PDSCH-Config, by ServingCellConfig or by ServingCellConfigCommon, or by PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MTCH and configuring up to 4 RateMatchPattern(s) per BWP and up to 4 RateMatchPattern(s) per serving-cell. The RateMatchPattern(s) configured for MBS broadcast is counted into the ones that are configured per serving-cell. A RateMatchPattern may contain:\n---\n- Within a BWP, the UE can be configured with one or more ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration(s) for aperiodic, semi-persistent and periodic time-domain behaviours (higher layer parameters aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList, sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList and \\( p \\)-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet respectively comprised in PDSCH-Config), with each ZP CSI-RS resource set consisting of at most 16 ZP CSIRS resources (higher layer parameter ZP-CSI-RS-Resource) in numerology of the BWP. The REs indicated by \\( p \\) -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are declared as not available for PDSCH. The REs indicated by sp-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList and aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList are declared as not available for PDSCH when their triggering and activation are applied, respectively. The following parameters are configured via higher layer signaling for each ZP CSI-RS resource configuration:\n---\nA subset of the TCI states defined in pdsch-Config included in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the ControlResourceSet belong to. They are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS(s) in one RS Set (TCI-State) and the PDCCH DMRS ports (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.). The network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries.\n---\nList of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS. Each TCI-Stateld refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resourcesForChannelMeasurement (in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above) belong to. First entry in qc/-info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of that NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qclinfo corresponds to second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.1). When this field is absent for aperiodic CSIRS, the UE shall use QCL information included in the \"indicated\" DL only/Joint TCI state as specified in TS 38.214\n---\nFor a target periodic CSI-RS, contains a reference to one TCI-State in TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type. For periodic CSI-RS, the source can be SSB or another periodic-CSI-RS. Refers to the TCI-State or DLorJoint-TCIState which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList or in dl-orJoint-TCIStateToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resource belongs to (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.3.1).\n---\nThe IDs of a second group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP Ievel) or in ServingCellConfig >rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). The field rateMatchPatternGroup2 applies to DCI format 1_1, and the field rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 applies to DCI format 1 _ 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).\n---\nList of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet. Each TCI-Stateld refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink of this serving cell indicated by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-ld in the ServingCellConfig in which this IE is included. First entry in qc/info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CS/-RS-Resources of that NZP-CS/-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qc/info corresponds to second entry in nzp-CS/-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause x.y.z).\n---\nFor [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17] in pdsch-Config each PDSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \\( K_{0} \\). The number of scheduled PDSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 signalled in DCI format 1_1.  If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is indicated re-transmission of PDSCH corresponding to a DL SPS by DCI format 1_1, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 by the DCI is more than one.",
