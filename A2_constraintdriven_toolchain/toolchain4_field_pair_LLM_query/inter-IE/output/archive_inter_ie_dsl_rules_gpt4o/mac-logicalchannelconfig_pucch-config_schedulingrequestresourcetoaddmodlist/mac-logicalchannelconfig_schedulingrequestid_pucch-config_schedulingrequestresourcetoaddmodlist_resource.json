The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured.\n---\nIn addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or SLDRX Command indication. The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\nAll triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and \\( s l \\)-retx-BSR-Timer and \\( s l \\) -periodic-BSR-Timer shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.  NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.\n---\n\\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1139 & - & F & Corrections on MCS selection when UE performing TX resource (re)selection check & 16.6.0 \\\\ \\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1140 & 1 & F & Correction on SR procedure for SL-CSI reporting & 16.6 .0 \\\\\n---\n- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config\n---\n- a first set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \\( =0 \\) if \\( O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq 2 \\) including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or - a second set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \\( =1 \\), if provided by higher layers, if \\( 2<O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq N_{2} \\) where \\( \\mathrm{N}_{2} \\) is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId \\( =1 \\); otherwise \\( N_{2} \\) is equal to 1706 , or\n---\nSR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.  The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining \\( m_{0} \\) as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting \\( m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 \\). For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting \\( b(0)=0 \\).\n---\n- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.  A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH.

A UE is configured by maxCodeRate a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR, and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4.\n---\n- if the PUCCH resource for the second PUCCH includes PUCCH format 2, 3, or 4 and additionally includes \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\mathrm{SR} \\) bits of priority \\( 1, O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1} \\) is replaced by \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) where \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) is determined according to clause 9.2.5.1",
