The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.  The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4).

For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 .\n---\nFor prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH and DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a second PUCCH - if the second PUCCH has priority index 1 ,\n---\n- \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}} \\) a total number of SR bits. \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}}=0 \\) if there is no scheduling request bit; otherwise, \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}}=\\left\\lceil\\log _{2}(K+1)\\right\\rceil \\) as described in clause 9.2.5.1 - \\( O_{\\mathrm{CSI}}=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\text {Natad }}\\left(O_{\\mathrm{CSI}-\\text { partl, } n}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}-\\text { parl2, } n}\\right) \\), where \\( O_{\\text {CSI-partl, } n \\text { is a number of Part } 1 \\mathrm{CSI} \\text { report bits for CSI report with }} \\) priority value \\( n, O_{\\text {CSI-part } 2, n} \\) is a number of Part 2 CSI report bits, if any, for CSI report with priority value \\( n \\) [6, TS 38.214], and \\( N_{\\text {CS] }}^{\\text {total }} \\) is a number of CSI reports that include overlapping CSI reports\n---\n- would transmit overlapping PUCCHs that include a first PUCCH with \\( O_{\\text {ACK }, 0} \\) HARQ-ACK information bits of priority 0 and a second PUCCH with \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK} 1} \\) HARQ-ACK information bits of priority 1 - if the PUCCH resource for the second PUCCH includes PUCCH format 2, 3, or 4 and additionally includes \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\mathrm{SR} \\) bits of priority \\( 1, O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1} \\) is replaced by \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) where \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) is determined according to clause 9.2.5.1\n---\nA UE does not multiplex different UCI types in a PUCCH transmission with repetitions over \\( N_{\\text {PUCCH }}^{\\text {repeat }}>1 \\) slots.
