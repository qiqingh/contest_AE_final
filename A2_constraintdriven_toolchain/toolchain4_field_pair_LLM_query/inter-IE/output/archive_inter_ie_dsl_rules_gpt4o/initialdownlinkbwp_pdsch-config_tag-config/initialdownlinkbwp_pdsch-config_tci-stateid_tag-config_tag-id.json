If tag-Id-ptr is configured for the TCI state indicated by the TCI state ID field in the LTM target cell and tag-Id-ptr is set to value \\( n l \\), this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag2-Id of the LTM target cell; otherwise, this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag-id of the LTM target cell.
