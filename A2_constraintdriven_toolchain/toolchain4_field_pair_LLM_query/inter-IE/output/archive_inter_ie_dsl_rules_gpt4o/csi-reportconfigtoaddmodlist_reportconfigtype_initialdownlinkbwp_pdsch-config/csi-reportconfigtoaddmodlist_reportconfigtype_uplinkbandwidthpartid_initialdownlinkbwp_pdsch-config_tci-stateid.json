    "evidence": "Indicates TCI states for PDSCH reception at SCell addition/activation or of the PSCell at SCG activation. This field includes exactly one bit for each configured TCI state in this BWP ordered by increasing values of TC/-State/d, i.e. the first bit indicates the activation state of the TCI state with the lowest TC/-State/d value, the second value indicates the activation status of the TCI state with the second lowest TCI-State-Id value, and so on. A bit set to 0 indicates that the corresponding TCI state is deactivated, a bit set to 1 indicates that the TCl state is activated.\n---\n- TCI State ID: This field indicates the TCI state identified by TCI-Stateld as specified in TS 38.331 [5] applicable to the Control Resource Set identified by CORESET ID field. If the field of CORESET ID is set to 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld for a TCI state of the first 64 TCI-states configured by tci-StatesToAddModList and tciStatesToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or by dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToAddModList and dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or the reference BWP. If the field of CORESET ID is set to the other value than 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld configured by tci-StatesPDCCHToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID. The length of the field is 7 bits.\n---\n- BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{C}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether the octet containing TCI state \\( \\mathrm{ID}_{1,2} \\) is present. If this field is set to 1 , the octet containing TCI state ID \\( _{1,2} \\) is present. If this field is set to 0 , the octet containing TCI state ID \\( _{1,2} \\) is not present;\n---\n- CORESET Pool ID: This field indicates that the mapping between the activated TCI states and the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication set by field TCI state ID is specific to the ControlResourceSetld configured with CORESET Pool ID as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. This field set to 1 indicates that the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 1 , otherwise the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 0 . If no more than one value for the coresetPoollndex is configured for any CORESET in the BWP, the R bit is present instead;\n---\n- DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. If value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Serving Cell indicated by Serving Cell ID is joint, this field is considered as the reserved bits. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether each TCI codepoint has multiple TCI states or single TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 1 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes the DL TCI state and the UL TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes only the DL/joint TCI state or the UL TCI state. The codepoint to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI state ID fields;\n---\n- UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. If value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Serving Cell indicated by Serving Cell ID is joint, this field is considered as the reserved bits. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether each TCI codepoint has multiple TCI states or single TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 1 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes the DL TCI state and the UL TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes only the DL/joint TCI state or the UL TCI state. The codepoint to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI state ID fields; - D/U: This field indicate whether the TCI state ID in the same octet is for joint/downlink or uplink TCI state. If this field is set to 1 , the TCI state ID in the same octet is for joint/downlink. If this field is set to 0 , the TCI state ID in the same octet is for uplink;\n---\n- SRS Resource Set's Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell, which contains the indicated SP/AP SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the Serving Cell associated with all TCI states indicated by the TCI State ID, fields. The length of the field is 5 bits; - SRS Resource Set's BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9], which contains the indicated SP/AP SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the BWP associated with all TCI states indicated by the TCI State [D, fields. The length of the field is 2 bits;\n---\nvalue of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Serving Cell indicated by TCI State Serving Cell ID, is separate, this field indicates a UL BWP. The length of the field is 2 bits; - TCI State [D: This field contains an identifier of the TCI state used for SRS resource i. TCI State ID0 refers to the first SRS resource which is indicated SRS Resource [D0, TCI State [D1 refers to the second one and so on. If joint/downlink TCI State is used, 7-bits length TCI state ID i.e. TCI-Stateld as specified in TS 38.331 [5] is used. If separate downlink and uplink TCI State is used, the most significant bit of TCI state ID is considered as a reserved bit and the remaining 6 bits indicate the TCI-UL-State-Id as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 7 bits;\n---\n- Downlink TCI state ID: This field is used to indicate the downlink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. It contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits), as specified in TS 38.331 [5], of a TCI State in the active DL BWP. The length of the field is 7 bits;\n---\n- Uplink TCI state ID or SRS Resource ID: This field is used to indicate the uplink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. If the dl-OrJointTCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and unifiedTCIStateType is configured with a value joint, this field contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits) of a Joint TCI State configured in the active DL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission. If the ul-TCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this field contains TCI-UL-State-Id (contained in the 6 rightmost bits) of an UL TCI State configured in the active UL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero. Otherwise, 6 rightmost bits of this field contain SRS-ResourceID configured in the active UL BWP which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero;\n---\neach with same activated tci-StatelD value, to CORESETs with a same index in all configured DL BWPs of all configured cells in a list determined from a serving cell index, where one or two tci-StateID, the CORESET index, and the serving cell index are provided by a MAC CE command.  For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE is provided by higher layers with \\( S \\leq 10 \\) search space sets where, for each search space set from the \\( S \\) search space sets, the UE is provided the following by SearchSpace:",
