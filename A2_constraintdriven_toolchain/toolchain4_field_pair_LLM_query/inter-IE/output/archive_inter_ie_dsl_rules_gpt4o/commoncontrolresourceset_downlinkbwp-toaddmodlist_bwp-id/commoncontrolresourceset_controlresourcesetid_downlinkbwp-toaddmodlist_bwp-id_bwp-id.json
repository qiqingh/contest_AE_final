    "evidence": "- BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits. This field is ignored if this MAC CE applies to a set of Serving Cells; - \\( \\mathrm{T}_{1} \\) : If there is a TCI state with TCI-Stateld i as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this field indicates the activation/deactivation status of the TCI state with TCI-Stateld i , otherwise MAC entity shall ignore the \\( \\mathrm{T}_{1} \\) field. The \\( \\mathrm{T}_{1} \\) field is set to 1 to indicate that the TCI state with TCI-Stateld i shall be activated and mapped to the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field, as specified in TS 38.214 [7]. The \\( \\mathrm{T}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 to indicate that the TCI state with TCI-Stateld i shall be deactivated and is not mapped to the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field. The codepoint to which the TCI State is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI States with T , field set to 1 , i.e. the first TCI State with T , field set to 1 shall be mapped to the codepoint value 0 , second TCI State with \\( T_{1} \\) field set to 1 shall be mapped to the codepoint value 1 and so on. The maximum number of activated TCI states is 8 . The activated TCI states can be associated with at most one PCI different from the Serving Cell PCI at a time; - CORESET Pool ID: This field indicates that mapping between the activated TCI states and the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication set by field \\( \\mathrm{T}_{1} \\) is specific to the ControlResourceSetld configured with CORESET Pool ID as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. This field set to 1 indicates that this MAC CE shall be applied for the DL transmission scheduled by CORESET with the CORESET pool ID equal to 1 , otherwise, this MAC CE shall be applied for the DL transmission scheduled by CORESET pool ID equal to 0 . If the coresetPoollndex is not configured for any CORESET, MAC entity shall ignore the CORESET Pool ID field in this MAC CE when receiving the MAC CE. If the Serving Cell in the MAC CE is configured in a cell list that contains more than one Serving Cell, the CORSET Pool ID field shall be ignored when receiving the MAC CE.\n---\n- CORESET Pool ID: This field indicates that the mapping between the activated TCI states and the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication set by field TCI state ID is specific to the ControlResourceSetld configured with CORESET Pool ID as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. This field set to 1 indicates that the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 1 , otherwise the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 0 . If no more than one value for the coresetPoollndex is configured for any CORESET in the BWP, the R bit is present instead; - Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneous U-TCI-UpdateList I, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneous U-TCIUpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCIUpdateList4, respectively; - DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;\n---\nWhen the bwp-id or cell for QCL-TypeA/D source RS in a QCL-Info of the TCI state configured with DLorJointTCIState is not configured, the UE assumes that QCL-TypeA/D source RS is configured in the CC/DL BWP where TCI state applies.  When tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, the UE with activated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState receives DCI format 1_1/1_2 providing indicated DLorJointTCIState or ULTCIState for a CC or all CCs in the same CC list configured by simultaneous TCI-UpdateListl-r 17, simultaneous TCI-UpdateList2-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList3-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList4-r17. The DCI format 1_1/1_2 can be with or without, if applicable, DL assignment. If the DCI format \\( 1 \\_1 / 1 \\_2 / \\) is without DL assignment, the UE can assume the following:",
