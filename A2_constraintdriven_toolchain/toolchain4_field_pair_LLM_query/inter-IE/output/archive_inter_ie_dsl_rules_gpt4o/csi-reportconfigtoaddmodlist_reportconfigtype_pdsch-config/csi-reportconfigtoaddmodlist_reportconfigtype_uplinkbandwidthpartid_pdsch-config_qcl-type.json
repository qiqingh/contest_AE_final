If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\), and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\). When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL.\n---\nWhen aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic reporting, the CSI-RS offset is configured per resource set by the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset or aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16. The CSI-RS triggering offset has the values of \\( \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6, \\ldots, 15,16,24\\} \\) slots. If the UE is not configured with minimumScheduling OffsetKO for any DL BWP and minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 for any UL BWP and if all the associated trigger states do not have the higher layer parameter qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the corresponding TCI states, the CSI-RS triggering offset is fixed to zero. The aperiodic triggering offset of the CSI-[M follows offset of the associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement.

If a TCI-State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS can be an SS/PBCH block, periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS located in same or different CC/DL BWP.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, corresponding to the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell, as described in Clause 9.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. If the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell corresponds to two spatial relations, the UE shall transmit the PUSCH according to the spatial relation with the lower ID.  For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is not configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, snischemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption.\n---\n- If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, the presence of the associated CSI-RS is indicated by the SRS request field if the value of the SRS request field is not ' 00 ' as in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of [5, TS 38.212] and if the scheduling DCI is not used for cross carrier or cross bandwidth part scheduling. If UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in the active DL BWP and the currently applicable minimum scheduling offset restriction \\( K_{0, m i n} \\) is larger than 0 , the UE does not expected to receive the scheduling DCI with the SRS request field value other than ' 00 '. The CSI-RS is located in the same slot as the SRS request field. If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, any of the TCI states configured in the scheduled CC shall not be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.\n---\nWhen the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS is set 'enabled', and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo for the SRS resource, except for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'beamManagement' or for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' with configuration of associatedCSI-RS or for the SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, is not configured in FR2 and if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter(s) pathlossReferenceRS, and if the UE is not configured with different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSets, and is not provided at least one TCI codepoint mapped with two TCI states, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource in an active UL BWP of a CC, - according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the active DL\n---\nList of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS. Each TCI-Stateld refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resourcesForChannelMeasurement (in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above) belong to. First entry in qc/-info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of that NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qclinfo corresponds to second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.1). When this field is absent for aperiodic CSIRS, the UE shall use QCL information included in the \"indicated\" DL only/Joint TCI state as specified in TS 38.214\n---\nA UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList and a set \\( \\bar{q}_{1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList or candidateBeamRSListExt or candidateBeamRSSCellList for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. Instead of the sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1} \\), for each BWP of a serving cell, the UE can be provided respective two sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes that can be activated by a MAC CE [11 TS 38.321] and corresponding two sets \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList l and candidateBeamRSList2, respectively, for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. The set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) is associated with the set \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\) and the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) is associated with the set \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\).  If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH. If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, where the UE is provided two coresetPoollndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoollndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. The UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), the UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include up to a number of \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\) RS indexes indicated by capabilityparametername. If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), and if a number of active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs is larger than \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\), the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs corresponding to search space sets according to an ascending order for monitoring periodicity. If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index.\n---\n- the UE is not provided PUCCH resources for the active UL BWP of serving cell \\( c \\), and - the UE is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 the UE determines a RS resource index \\( q_{d} \\) providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP of the serving cell \\( c \\).
