In absence of CSI-RS configuration, and unless otherwise configured, the UE may assume PDCCH DM-RS and SS/PBCH block to be quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters.\n---\nFor a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.\n---\nFor PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .\n---\nIf a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH.\n---\nWhen the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subrame, } \\mu}+ \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K} a c}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\( \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} \\) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is provided by \\( K \\)-Mac or \\( k_{\\text {mac }}=0 \\) if \\( K \\)-Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.\n---\n- else if, the UE applies the first one of two TCI states indicated for the CORESET with the lowest CORESET ID in the latest slot within the active BWP of the cell in which the CSI-RS is to be received when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, - else if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \\( \\{14,28,48\\} \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu \\text { CSIRS }^{-3}\\right)} \\) and when enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided or the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter trs-Info, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameters repetition and trs-Info scheduled with offset larger than or equal to \\( 48 \\cdot 2^{\\max \\left(0, \\mu_{\\text {CSIRS }}-3\\right)} \\) when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r 16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on' scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided; - else if at least one CORESET is configured for the BWP in which the aperiodic CSI-RS is received, when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption used for the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored;\n---\nIf the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on carrier \\( c_{1} \\) with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on carrier \\( c_{1} \\) and serving cell \\( c_{2} \\), the UE is not expected to be configured or indicated with SRS resource(s) such that SRS transmission on carrier \\( c_{\\text {, }} \\) (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) would collide with the REs corresponding to the SS/PBCH blocks configured for the UE or the slots belonging to a control resource set indicated by \\( M I B \\) or \\( S I B I \\) on serving cell \\( c_{2} \\).\n---\nThe downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/insync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS",
