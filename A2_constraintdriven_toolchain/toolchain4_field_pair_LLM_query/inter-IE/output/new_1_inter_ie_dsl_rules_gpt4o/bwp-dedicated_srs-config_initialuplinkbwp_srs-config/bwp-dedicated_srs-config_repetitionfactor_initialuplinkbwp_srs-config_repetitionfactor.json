For the case of an SRS resource configured as aperiodic by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, it is given by \\( n_{\\text {SRS }}= \\left[l^{\\prime} /(s R)\\right] \\) within the slot in which the \\( N_{\\text {symb }}^{\\text {SRS }} \\) symbol SRS resource is transmitted. The quantity \\( s \\) is given by \\( s=2 \\) if the higher-layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports-n8 equals 'ports8tdm', otherwise \\( s=1 \\).

All the DL PRS resources within one resource set have the same resource repetition factor.\n---\n- Number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource, starting OFDM symbol of the SRS resource within a slot including repetition factor R as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceMapping and described in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If \\( R \\) is not configured, then \\( R \\) is equal to the number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource.\n---\nFor a given \\( S R S \\) resource, the \\( U E \\) is configured with repetition factor \\( R \\in\\{1,2,4\\} \\) or \\( R \\in\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14\\} \\) by higher layer parameter resourceMapping in SRS-Resource where \\( R \\leq N_{s} \\). When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is not configured ( \\( R=N_{s} \\) ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped in all the \\( N_{s} \\) symbols to the same set of subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition ( \\( R=1 \\) ), according to the SRS hopping parameters \\( B_{\\text {SRS }}, C_{\\text {SRS }} \\) and \\( b_{\\text {hop }} \\) defined in clause 6.4-1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within an SRS resource in each slot are configured ( \\( N_{s} \\geq 4, R \\geq 2 \\) ), each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and frequency hopping across the \\( \\frac{N_{S}}{R} \\) pairs is according to the SRS hopping parameters \\( B_{S R S}, C_{S R S} \\) and \\( b_{\\text {hop }} \\), where \\( N_{S} \\) should be divisible by \\( R \\).\n---\nThis field specifies the offset in units of slots between two repeated instances of a DL-PRS Resource corresponding to the same DL-PRS Resource ID within a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. The time duration spanned by one DL-PRS Resource Set containing repeated DL-PRS Resources should not exceed the periodicity configured by periodicityAndOffset. The field is mandatory present, if repetitionFactor is present. Otherwise, it is not present.\n---\nConfiguration of PUCCH repetition factor per PUCCH resource with associated scheduling DCI corresponding to Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition. This field is applicable when Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition is enabled. For a PUCCH resource, if both the field pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots and the field nrofSlots are present, the field nrofSiots is ignored and apply the value of pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots corresponding to Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition. If this field is absent in a PUCCH resource with associated scheduling DCI , the UE applies the value of field nrofSlots.\n---\nOFDM symbol location of the SRS resource within a slot including nrofSymbols (number of OFDM symbols), startPosition (value 0 refers to the last symbol, value 1 refers to the second last symbol, and so on) and repetitionFactor (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1 and TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.4). The configured SRS resource does not exceed the slot boundary. If resourceMapping-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix). If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbois and repetitionFactor to ' n 1 '.",
