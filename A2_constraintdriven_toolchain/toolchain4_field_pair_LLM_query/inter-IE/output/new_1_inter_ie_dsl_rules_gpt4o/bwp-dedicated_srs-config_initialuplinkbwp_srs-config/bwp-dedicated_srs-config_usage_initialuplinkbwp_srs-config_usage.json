    "evidence": "When only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3. The TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3-1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The indicated SRI in slot \\( n \\) is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI.  When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', one or two SRI(s), and one or two TPMI(s) are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicator and two Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) and TPMI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6-1.2.1. Each TPMI, based on indicated codepoint of SRS Resource Set indicator, is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the corresponding SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured for the applicable SRS resource set, or if a single SRS resource is configured for the applicable SRS resource set TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource. For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot \\( n \\) is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.\n---\nFor non-codebook based transmission, the UE can calculate the precoder used for the transmission of SRS based on measurement of an associated NZP CSI-RS resource. A UE can be configured with only one NZP CSI-RS resource for the SRS resource set with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' if configured.\n---\nWhen two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', for PUSCH repetition Type A, in case \\( K>1 \\), the same symbol allocation is applied across the \\( K \\) consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall repeat the TB across the \\( K \\) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, and the association of the first and second SRS resource set in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 to each slot is determined as follows:\n---\n- Number of DM-RS CDM groups, DM-RS ports, SRS resource indication and DM-RS sequence initialization are determined as in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], and the antenna port value, the bit value for DM-RS sequence initialization, precoding information and number of layers, SRS resource indicator are provided by antennaPort, dmrs-SeqInitialization, precodingAndNumberOfLayers, and srs-ResourceIndicator respectively; When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2, precoding information and number of layers (applicable when higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook') associated with the first and second SRS resource set is provided by precodingAndNumberOfLayers and precodingAndNumberOfLayers2, respectively, and SRS resource indicators associated with the first and second SRS resource sets are provided by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2, respectively. When both srsResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 are configured with two SRS resource sets, the two SRS resource sets configured by srs-ResourceSetToAddModList is used to determine the SRS resource indications by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2.\n---\n- For any two consecutive PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B, and when two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', a different SRS resource set association is used for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A , or PUSCH repetition type B , according to Clause 6.1.2.1.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter \\( t r s \\)-Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.  If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set as 'antennaSwitching', the UE may be configured with only one of the following configurations depending on the indicated UE capability supportedSRS-TxPortSwitch ('t1r2' for 1T2R, 't1r1-t1r2' for 1T=1R/1T2R, 't2r4' for 2T4R, 't1r4' for 1T4R, 't1r6' for 1T6R, '1t8r' for 1T8R, '2t6r' for 2T6R, '2t8r' for 2T8R, '4t8r' for 4T8R, 't1r1-t1r2-t1r4' for 1T=1R/1T2R/1T4R, 't1r4t 2 r 4 ' for 1T4R/2T4R, 't1r1-t1r2-t2r2-t2r4' for 1T=1R/1T2R/2T=2R/2T4R, 't1r1-t1r2-t2r2-t1r4-t2r4' for \\( 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 1 \\mathrm{~T} 2 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} / 1 \\mathrm{~T} 4 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T} 4 \\mathrm{R} \\), ' t 1 r 1 ' for \\( 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} \\), ' t 2 r 2 ' for \\( 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} \\), ' \\( \\mathrm{t} 1 \\mathrm{r} 1-\\mathrm{t} 2 \\mathrm{r} 2 \\) ' for \\( 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} \\), ' t 4 r 4 ' for \\( 4 \\mathrm{~T}=4 \\mathrm{R} \\), or ' \\( \\mathrm{t} 1 \\mathrm{r} 1-\\mathrm{t} 2 \\mathrm{r} 2-\\mathrm{t} 4 \\mathrm{r} 4 \\) ' for \\( 1 \\mathrm{~T}=1 \\mathrm{R} / 2 \\mathrm{~T}=2 \\mathrm{R} / 4 \\mathrm{~T}=4 \\mathrm{R} \\) ):\n---\nFor an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2_3 and if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA', and given by SRS-CarrierSwitching, without PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the order of the triggered SRS transmission on the serving cells follow the order of the serving cells in the indicated set of serving cells configured by higher layers, where the UE in each serving cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s) from srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage set to 'antennaSwitching' and higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic'.\n---\nFor non-codebook based UL transmission, the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit is determined based on SRI(s) in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) or higher layer parameter sri-Resourcelndicator in rrcConfiguredUplinkGrant. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'noncodebook', the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit corresponding to each SRS resource set is determined based on SRI(s) corresponding to the associated SRS resource set or higher layer parameter sri-ResourceIndicator or sriResourceIndicator 2 corresponding to the associated SRS resource set in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. A UE is configured with the PT-RS port index for each configured SRS resource by the higher layer parameter ptrs-PortIndex configured by SRS-Config if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in DMRSUplinkConfig. If the PT-RS port index associated with different SRIs are the same, the corresponding UL DM-RS ports are associated to the one UL PT-RS port.\n---\n- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerModel, and each SRS resource in the SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, \\( s \\) is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource\n---\n- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and is provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SRS resource set indicator field, and for active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell\n---\n\\( 3> \\) if tab-IP-Usage is set to \\( f l-C \\) :",
