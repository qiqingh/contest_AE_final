The UE can be provided per serving cell by discoveryBurstWindowLength a duration of the discovery burst transmission window. If discoveryBurstWindowLength is not provided, the UE assumes that the duration of the discovery burst transmission window is a half frame. For a serving cell, the UE assumes that a periodicity of the discovery burst transmission window is same as a periodicity of half frames for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst. If MSB \\( k, k \\geq 1 \\), of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1 , the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es)\n---\nIf two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command, the latter slot is reduced in duration relative to the former slot. The UE does not change \\( N_{T A} \\) during an actual transmission time window for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission [6, TS 38.214].\n---\n- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is different from that of E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR, the UE provides power headroom of the first NR slot that fully overlaps with the E-UTRA subframe;\n---\nIf the UE does not detect the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \\( N_{T, 1}+0.75 \\mathrm{msec} \\) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \\( N_{T, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 assuming \\( \\mu \\) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), the corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DMRS is configured, and the corresponding PRACH. For \\( \\mu=0 \\), the UE assumes \\( N_{1,0}=14 \\) [6, TS 38.214]. For a PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines \\( N_{1} \\) assuming SCS configuration \\( \\mu=0 \\).\n---\nIn response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant when a UE has not been provided a C-RNTI, the UE attempts to detect a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI scheduling a PDSCH that includes a UE contention resolution identity [11, TS 38.321]. In response to the PDSCH reception with the UE contention resolution identity, the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH. The PUCCH transmission is within a same active UL BWP as the PUSCH transmission. A minimum time between the last symbol of the PDSCH reception and the first symbol of the corresponding PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information is equal to \\( N_{T, 1}+0.5 \\mathrm{msec} . N_{T, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For \\( \\mu=0 \\), the UE assumes \\( N_{1,0}=14[6 \\), TS 38.214].\n---\n- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \\( P_{\\text {switch }} \\) symbols after a slot where the timer expires or after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) when \\( \\mu \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\} \\)\n---\n- one bit, if intraCellGuardBandsDL-List for the serving cell indicates no intra-cell guard-bands are configured, where a value of ' 1 ' indicates that the serving cell is available for receptions, a value of ' 0 ' indicates that the serving cell is not available for receptions, by availableRB-SetsPerCell, and the serving cell remains available or unavailable for reception until the end of the remaining channel occupancy duration\n---\nIf a UE detects a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active DL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in a scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.",
