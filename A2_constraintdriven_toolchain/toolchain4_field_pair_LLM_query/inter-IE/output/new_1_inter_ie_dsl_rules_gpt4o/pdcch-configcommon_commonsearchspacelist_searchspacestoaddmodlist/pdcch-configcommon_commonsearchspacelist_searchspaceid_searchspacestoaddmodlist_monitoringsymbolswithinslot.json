For RB set \\( k \\) indicated in the bitmap, the first \\( \\operatorname{PRB} \\) of the frequency domain monitoring location confined within the RB set is given by \\( R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu}+N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} \\), where \\( R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu} \\) is the index of first common RB of the RB set \\( k \\) [6, TS 38.214], and \\( N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} \\) is provided by \\( r b \\)-Offset or \\( N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }}=0 \\) if \\( r b \\)-Offset is not provided. For each RB set with a corresponding value of 1 in the bitmap, the frequency domain resource allocation pattern for the monitoring location is determined based on the first \\( N_{\\text {RBG }}^{\\text {size }} 0 \\) bits infrequencyDomainResources provided by the associated CORESET configuration.  If the monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot indicates to a UE to monitor PDCCH in a subset of up to three consecutive symbols that are same in every slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for all search space sets, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PDCCH SCS other than 15 kHz if the subset includes at least one symbol after the third symbol.\n---\nfor a USS, \\( M_{s_{1} \\max }^{(L)} \\) is the maximum of \\( M_{s_{1} n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\) over all configured \\( n_{C I} \\) values for a CCE aggregation level \\( L \\) of search space set \\( s \\); the RNTI value used for \\( n_{\\text {RNTI }} \\) is the C-RNTI. For search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \\( s_{j} \\) and \\( s_{i} \\), respectively, a UE monitors, in monitoring occasions with same index according to each of search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) in a slot, PDCCH candidates \\( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\) and \\( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\), with \\( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\), for detection of a DCI format with same information.
