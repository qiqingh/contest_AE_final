If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, where the UE is provided two coresetPoollndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoollndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. The UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), the UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include up to a number of \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\) RS indexes indicated by capabilityparametername. If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), and if a number of active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs is larger than \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\), the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs corresponding to search space sets according to an ascending order for monitoring periodicity. If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index.\n---\nA UE is not required to monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0/0A/1/2-PDCCH CSS set when the active TCI state for a corresponding CORESET is not associated with physCellld in ServingCellConfigCommon.  If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.\n---\nA UE does not expect to be provided a first symbol and a number of consecutive symbols for a CORESET that results to a PDCCH candidate mapping to symbols of different slots.  A UE does not expect any two PDCCH monitoring occasions on an active DL BWP, for a same search space set or for different search space sets, in a same CORESET to be separated by a non-zero number of symbols that is smaller than the CORESET duration.\n---\n- For a reduced capability half-duplex UE in paired spectrum and for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission, symbols indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. - For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbol(s) indicated by pdcch-ConfigSIBl in MIB for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.\n---\nWithin the active UL BWP, the assigned physical resource block \\( n \\) is mapped to virtual resource block \\( n \\). For DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and the union of the indicated set of RB sets and intra-cell guard bands defined in Clause 7 between the indicated RB sets, if any. For DCI 00 monitored in a common search space, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and a single uplink RB set of the active UL BWP. For DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the lowest indexed one amongst uplink RB set(s) that intersects the lowest-indexed CCE of the PDCCH in which the UE detects the DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) in the active downlink BWP . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the uplink RB set of a PUSCH when scheduled by DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. If there is no intersection, the uplink RB set is RB set 0 in the active uplink BWP. For DCI \\( 0-0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the same one in which the UE transmits the PRACH associated with the RAR UL grant, in which case the UE assumes that the uplink RB set is defined as when the UE is not configured with intraCellGuardBandsUL-List (see Clause 7).\n---\nUpon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if \\( k_{S S B}<24 \\) [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if \\( k_{S S B}<12 \\) for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if \\( k_{S S B}>23 \\) for FR1 or if \\( k_{S S B}>11 \\) for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon.\n---\n- the CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType \\( = \\) 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and\n---\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE determines an offset from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block - according to the offset in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and\n---\nThis field may indicate that this cell does not provide S/B1 and that there is hence no CORESET\\#0 configured in M/B (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).\n---\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, as described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE does not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld.",
