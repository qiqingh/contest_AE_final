When two PDCCH candidates from two linked search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine \\( N_{\\text {start }}^{\\text {CORESET }} \\).\n---\nIf a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex. For a ControlResourceSet without coresetPoollndex, the UE may assume that the ControlResourceSet is assigned with coresetPoollndex as 0 . When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], ControlResourceSets corresponding to different coresetPoolIndex values may be associated with different physical cell [Ds via activated TCI states of the ControlResourceSets, where ControlResourceSets corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and ControlResourceSets corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, the following operations are allowed:\n---\nIf a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE does not apply pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-config, if configured, to DCI format 1_1 on the DL BWP of the serving cell.\n---\nIf a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.\n---\nWhen the DCI size for DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) in USS is derived from the size of DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) in CSS but applied to an active BWP with size of \\( N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {active }} \\), a downlink type 1 resource block assignment field consists of a resource indication value ( \\( R I V \\) ) corresponding to a starting resource block \\( R B_{s t a r t}=0, K, 2 \\cdot K, \\ldots,\\left(N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {intial }}-1\\right) \\cdot K \\) and a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource blocks \\( L_{R B s}=K, 2 \\cdot K, \\ldots, N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }} \\cdot K \\), where \\( N_{B W P}^{\\text {initial }} \\) is given by\n---\nif \\( \\left(L_{\\text {RBS }}^{\\prime}-1\\right) \\leq\\left\\lfloor N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {inididal }} / 2\\right\\rfloor \\) then\n---\nThe UE is not expected to handle any transport blocks (TBs) in a 14 consecutive-symbol duration for normal CP (or 12 for extended CP) ending at the last symbol of the latest PDSCH transmission within an active BWP on a serving cell whenever\n---\nIf the DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState configurations are absent in a BWP of the CC, the UE can apply the DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState configurations from a reference BWP of a reference CC. The UE is not expected to be configured with TCI-State, SpatialRelationInfo or PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, except SpatialRelationInfoPos in a CC in a band, if the UE is configured with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState in any CC in the same band. The UE can assume that when the UE is configured with TCI-State in any CC in the CC list configured by simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1-r16, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2-r16, simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1-r16, or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2-r16, the UE is not configured with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState in any CC within the same band in the CC list.\n---\n- if carrier \\( N_{\\mathrm{grid}}^{\\mathrm{size}, \\mu}=52, N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}}=52, \\mu=0 \\) and the carrier is configured in paired spectrum, the band width of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freq Band configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is \\( X \\) resource blocks, where \\( X \\geq 28 \\) resources if the UE indicates trs-AddB W-Set I for the trs-AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 1] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation and \\( X \\geq 32 \\) if the UE indicates \\( t r s \\)-AddBW-Set2 for the AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 2] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation; in these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising \\( \\mathrm{X}<52 \\) resource blocks, the UE does not expect that the total number of PRBs allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4 , where all CSI-RS resource configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freqBand configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is the minimum of 52 and \\( \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{size}} \\) resource blocks, or is equal to \\( \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} \\) resource blocks. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, freqBand configured by CSI-RSResourceMapping, is the minimum of 48 and \\( \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}}^{\\text {size }} \\) resource blocks, or is equal to \\( \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BWP}, \\mathrm{i}} \\) sizesource blocks.",
