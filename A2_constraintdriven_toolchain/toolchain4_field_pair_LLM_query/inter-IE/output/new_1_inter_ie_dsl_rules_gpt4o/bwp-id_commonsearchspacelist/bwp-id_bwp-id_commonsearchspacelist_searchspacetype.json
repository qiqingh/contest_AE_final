The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set.

When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, each [D in the list of reference signal [Ds may refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell indicated by PCI field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a \\( d l- \\) PRS-ID indicated by DL-PRS ID field in the activation command.\n---\n- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing' or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, or of the latest reference aperiodic CSI-RS. If the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS or of the reference aperiodic SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS. - when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot \\( n \\), the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.
