The downlink reference-signal transmit power is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in \\( [\\mathrm{W}] \\) ) of the resource elements that carry the configured CSI-RS within the operating system bandwidth.\n---\n- same powerControlOffset and powerControlOffsetSS given by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource value across all resources.\n---\n- powerControlOffsetSS given by a TRS-ResourceSet applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet.\n---\nThe physical layer in the UE assesses the radio link quality according to the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0}, \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), of resource configurations against the threshold \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\text {out }, \\mathrm{LR} \\text {. }} \\) For the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\), the UE assesses the radio link quality only according to SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell or the PSCell or periodic CSI-RS resource configurations that are quasi co-located, as described in [6, TS 38.214], with the DM-RS of PDCCH receptions monitored by the UE. The UE applies the \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{LR}} \\) threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from a SS/PBCH block. The UE applies the \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{LR}} \\) threshold to the L1RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power with a value provided by powerControlOffsetSS.\n---\nIf the UE is not configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided by \\( s s-P B C H \\) BlockPower. If the UE is configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided either by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or by powerControlOffsetSS providing an offset of the CSI-RS transmission power relative to the SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. [f powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB .\n---\nIf a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasicollocated with as described in clause 10.1, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) is associated with a periodic CSI-RS configuration as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is obtained by ss-PBCH-BlockPower and powerControlOffsetSS where powerControlOffsetSS provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB . If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' and the UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by power ControlOffsetSS.",
