For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant over SSS carried in different SS/PBCH blocks. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume that the ratio of SSS EPRE to PBCH DM-RS EPRE is 0 dB .\n---\nWhen receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.  When receiving PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI, or MSGB-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE used for RACH association as applicable, and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI in response to a random access procedure triggered by a PDCCH order which triggers contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell [10, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of the received PDCCH order and the DM-RS ports of the corresponding PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI are quasi co-located with the same SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.\n---\nThe UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot, if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was not contained within the first three symbols of the slot.
