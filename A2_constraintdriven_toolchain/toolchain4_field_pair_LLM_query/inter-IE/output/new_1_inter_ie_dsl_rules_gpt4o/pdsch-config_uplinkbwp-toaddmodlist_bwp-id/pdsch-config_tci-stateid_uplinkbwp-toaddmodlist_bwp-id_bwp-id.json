    "evidence": "- BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{C}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether the octet containing TCI state \\( \\mathrm{ID}_{1,2} \\) is present. If this field is set to 1 , the octet containing TCI state ID \\( _{1,2} \\) is present. If this field is set to 0 , the octet containing TCI state ID \\( _{1,2} \\) is not present;\n---\n- CORESET Pool ID: This field indicates that the mapping between the activated TCI states and the codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication set by field TCI state ID is specific to the ControlResourceSetld configured with CORESET Pool ID as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. This field set to 1 indicates that the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 1 , otherwise the TCI states are specified to CORESET pool ID equal to 0 . If no more than one value for the coresetPoollndex is configured for any CORESET in the BWP, the R bit is present instead; - Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneous U-TCI-UpdateList I, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneous U-TCIUpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCIUpdateList4, respectively; - DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;\n---\n- DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. If value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Serving Cell indicated by Serving Cell ID is joint, this field is considered as the reserved bits. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether each TCI codepoint has multiple TCI states or single TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 1 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes the DL TCI state and the UL TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes only the DL/joint TCI state or the UL TCI state. The codepoint to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI state ID fields;\n---\n- UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. If value of unifiedTCI-StateType in the Serving Cell indicated by Serving Cell ID is joint, this field is considered as the reserved bits. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) : This field indicates whether each TCI codepoint has multiple TCI states or single TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 1 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes the DL TCI state and the UL TCI state. If \\( \\mathrm{P}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 , it indicates that \\( i^{\\text {th }} \\) TCI codepoint includes only the DL/joint TCI state or the UL TCI state. The codepoint to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI state ID fields; - D/U: This field indicate whether the TCI state ID in the same octet is for joint/downlink or uplink TCI state. If this field is set to 1 , the TCI state ID in the same octet is for joint/downlink. If this field is set to 0 , the TCI state ID in the same octet is for uplink;\n---\n- SRS Resource Set's Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell, which contains the indicated SP/AP SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the Serving Cell associated with all TCI states indicated by the TCI State ID, fields. The length of the field is 5 bits; - SRS Resource Set's BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9], which contains the indicated SP/AP SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the BWP associated with all TCI states indicated by the TCI State [D, fields. The length of the field is 2 bits;",
