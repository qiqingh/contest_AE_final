When the PDCCH reception incudes two PDCCH candidates from two respectvie search space sets, as described in clause 10 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling the PDSCH ends at least \\( 14 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\nWhen receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_2 \\) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-CRNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is configured with pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots.

The UE may expect that the TB is repeated within each symbol allocation among each of the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots and the PDSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_2 \\) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CSRNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format 1_1 or 1_2, the UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the reception of pdschAggregationFactor repetitions, in sps-Config if configured, or across the pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config otherwise, larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity P obtained from the corresponding sps-Config.

The pair of reserved resources are respectively indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter resourceBlocks given by RateMatchPattern) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters symbolsInResourceBlock given by RateMatchPattern) for which the reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for PDSCH . For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by RateMatchPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair is present in the unit.
