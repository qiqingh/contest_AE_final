The 2-bit SRS request field in DCI format 2_3 indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in clause 7.3 of [5, TS 38.212] and defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB', or indicates the SRS transmission on a set of serving cells configured by higher layers if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA'.  For PUCCH and SRS on the same carrier, a UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying only CSI report(s), or only L1-RSRP report(s), or only L1SINR report(s). A UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured or aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK, link recovery request (as defined in clause 9.24 of [6,38.213]) and/or SR. In the case that SRS is not transmitted due to overlap with PUCCH, only the SRS symbol(s) that overlap with PUCCH symbol(s) are dropped. PUCCH shall not be transmitted when aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted to overlap in the same symbol with PUCCH carrying semi-persistent/periodic CSI report(s) or semi-persistent/periodic L1-RSRP report(s) only, or only L1-SINR report(s).\n---\n\\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:\n---\nOnly PUCCH resources on a BWP which is active at the time of SR transmission occasion are considered valid.

The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\nAll triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and \\( s l \\)-retx-BSR-Timer and \\( s l \\) -periodic-BSR-Timer shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.  NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.\n---\n\\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1139 & - & F & Corrections on MCS selection when UE performing TX resource (re)selection check & 16.6.0 \\\\ \\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1140 & 1 & F & Correction on SR procedure for SL-CSI reporting & 16.6 .0 \\\\\n---\n- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config\n---\nIf the UE is provided SPS-PUCCH-AN-List and transmits \\( O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\mathrm{UCI} \\) information bits that include only HARQ-ACK information bits in response to one or more SPS PDSCH receptions and SR, if any, the UE determines a PUCCH resource to be\n---\n- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.
