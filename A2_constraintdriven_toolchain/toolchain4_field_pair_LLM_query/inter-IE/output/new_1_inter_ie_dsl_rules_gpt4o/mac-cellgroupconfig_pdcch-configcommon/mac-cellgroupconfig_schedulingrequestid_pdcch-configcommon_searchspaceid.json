    "evidence": "A UE can be provided, by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.24 for the UE to transmit PUCCH [11, TS 38.321]. If the PCell or the PSCell is associated with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\), and with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\), the UE can be provided by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR. If the UE is provided only the first configuration, the UE transmits a PUCCH with LRR for either set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\). If the UE is provided both the first and second configurations, the UE uses the first configuration to transmt a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and the second configuration to transmit a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1}[11 \\), TS 38.321].  The UE can provide in a first PUSCH MAC CE index(es) for at least corresponding SCell(s) with radio link quality worse than \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\text {out }, \\mathrm{LR}} \\), indication(s) of presence of \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) for corresponding SCell(s), and index(es) \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) for a periodic CSIRS configuration or for a SS/PBCH block provided by higher layers, as described in [11, TS 38.321], if any, for corresponding SCell(s).
