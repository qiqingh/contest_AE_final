    "evidence": "For codebook based transmission, the UE determines its codebook subsets based on TPMI(s) and upon the reception of higher layer parameter codebookSubset in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 02 which may be configured with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent', or 'partialAndNonCoherent', or 'nonCoherent' depending on the UE capability. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2' and the higher layer parameter codebookSubset or the higher layer parameter codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 is set to 'partialAndNonCoherent', and when the SRS-resourceSet with usage set to \"codebook\" includes at least one SRS resource with 4 ports and one SRS resource with 2 ports, the codebookSubset associated with the 2 -port SRS resource is 'nonCoherent'. The maximum transmission rank may be configured by the higher layer parameter maxRank in pusch-Config for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_1 and maxRankDCI-0-2 for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_2.\n---\nIf pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH in pusch-Config contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous PUSCHs, \\( K_{2} \\) indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and mapping type. The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated valid SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH signalled in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\).\n---\nIf the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\). The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\n- If pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is configured and set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', pusch-TimeDomainResourceAllocationListDCI-0-1 in pusch-Config is used;\n---\n- If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter transformPrecoder in pusch-Config, the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or disabled according to this parameter.\n---\n- if mcs-TableDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'qam256', and PUSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI,\n---\nFor PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and for TB processing over multiple slots (as determined according to procedures defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2 in puschConfig for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\), and by frequencyHopping provided in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than \\( 0 \\_2 \\), and by frequencyHopping provided in configured GrantConfig for configured PUSCH transmission. For PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by RAR UL grant or by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the frequency hopping flag information field of the RAR UL grant, and by the frequency hopping flag information field of DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, respectively. One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured:\n---\nFor PUSCH repetition Type B (as determined according to procedures defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\), by frequencyHoppingDCI-0-1 provided in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\), and by frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB provided in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant for Type 1 configured PUSCH transmission. The frequency hopping mode for Type 2 configured PUSCH transmission follows the configuration of the activating DCI format. One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured:\n---\n- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is provided, the UE scales \\( \\hat{P}_{\\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\) by \\( s \\) where: - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerModel, and each SRS resource in the SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, \\( s \\) is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerMode2,\n---\nIf a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided pusch-Config for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.\n---\nA UE determines time resources and frequency resources for PUSCH occasions in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-Config for the active UL BWP. If the active UL BWP is not the initial UL BWP and msgA-PUSCH-Config is not provided for the active UL BWP, the UE uses the msgA-PUSCH-Config provided for the initial UL BWP.\n---\n\\( 5> \\) if the Random Access procedure for an SCell is performed on uplink carrier where pusch-Config is not configured:",
