For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report.
