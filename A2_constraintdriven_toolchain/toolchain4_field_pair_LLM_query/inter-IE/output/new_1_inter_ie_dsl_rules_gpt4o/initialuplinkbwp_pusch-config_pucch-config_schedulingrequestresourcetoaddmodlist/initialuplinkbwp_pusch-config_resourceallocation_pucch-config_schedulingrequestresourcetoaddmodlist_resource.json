When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} \\) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of \\( N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} \\) symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the\n---\n5.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain  When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the Time domain resource assignment field value \\( m \\) of the DCI provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{0} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), and the PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.",
