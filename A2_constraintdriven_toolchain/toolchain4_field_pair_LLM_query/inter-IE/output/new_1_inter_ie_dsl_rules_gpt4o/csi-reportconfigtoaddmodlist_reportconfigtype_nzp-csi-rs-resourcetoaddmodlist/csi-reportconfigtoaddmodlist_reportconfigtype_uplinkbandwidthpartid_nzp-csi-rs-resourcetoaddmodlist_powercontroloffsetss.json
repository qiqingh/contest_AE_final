If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS for the active DL BWP or, if RadioLinkMonitoringRS is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH receptions in CORESETS on the active DL BWP.\n---\nIf the UE is not configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided by \\( s s-P B C H \\) BlockPower. If the UE is configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided either by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or by powerControlOffsetSS providing an offset of the CSI-RS transmission power relative to the SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214].
