When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} \\) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of \\( N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} \\) symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the\n---\n5.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain  When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the Time domain resource assignment field value \\( m \\) of the DCI provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{0} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), and the PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.\n---\n\\hline \\multicolumn{6}{|l|}{Note 1: If the PDSCH was scheduled with SI-RNTI in PDCCH Type0 common search space, the UE may assume that this PDSCH resource allocation is not applied} \\\\\n---\n5.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain  Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1 , are supported. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling grant is received with DCI format \\( 1 \\_0,4 \\_0 \\) or \\( 4 \\_1 \\) then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used.\n---\nWhen the scheduling grant is received with DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\), a downlink type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource indication value ( \\( R I V \\) ) corresponding to a starting resource block group \\( R B G_{\\text {star }}=0,1, \\ldots, N_{R B G}-1 \\) and a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource block groups \\( L_{R B G s}=1, \\ldots, N_{R B G} \\), where the resource block groups are defined as in 5.1.2.2.1 with \\( P \\) defined by resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-1-2 if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter resourceAllocationTypel GranularityDCI-1-2, and \\( P=1 \\) otherwise. The resource indication value is defined by\n---\nWhen receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system information indicator in DCI is set to 1 , RARNTI, MSGB-RNTI, P-RNTI or TC-RNTI, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssbPositionsInBurst, and if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted.\n---\nA UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.\n---\n6.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain  When the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and no CSI report by a DCI or by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, or the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and a CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a DCI, the 'Time domain resource assignment' field value \\( m \\) of the DCI or the PUSCH time resource allocation field value \\( m \\) of the RAR UL grant or of the fallbackRAR UL grant provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocated table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{2} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), the PUSCH mapping type, the number of slots used for TBS determination (if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present in the resource allocation table), and the number of repetitions (if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission.\n---\n6.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain  The UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is determined according to clause 8.3 of [6,38.213] or a MsgA PUSCH transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined according to clause 8.1A of [6,38.213]. Three uplink resource allocation schemes type 0 , type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled.\n---\nWhen the scheduling grant is received with DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\), an uplink type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource indication value ( \\( R I V \\) ) corresponding to a starting resource block group \\( R B G_{\\text {starf }}=0,1, \\ldots, N_{R B G}-1 \\) and a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource block groups \\( L_{R B G s}=1, \\ldots, N_{R B G} \\), where the resource block groups are defined as in 6.1.2.2.1 with \\( P \\) defined by resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 if the UE is configured with\n---\nDCI format 0_1 for a given resource allocation type indicated by resourceAllocation, except if uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, in which case uplink type 2 resource allocation is used wherein the UE interprets the LSB bits in the higher layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation as for the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI 0_1 according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.2.2.3;\n---\n- A slot is not counted in the number of \\( N \\cdot K \\) slots if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by \\( t d d-U L-D L- \\) ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst.",
