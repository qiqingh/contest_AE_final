    "evidence": "The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is \\( S=2 \\), otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to \\( S=1 \\). For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.\n---\n- If aperiodic SRS resource set is configured, the associated NZP-CSI-RS is indicated via SRS request field in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and \\( 1 \\_1 \\), as well as DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present) and DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present), where AperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger and AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList (indicating the association between aperiodic SRS triggering state(s) and SRS resource sets), triggered SRS resource(s) srs-ResourceSetId, csi-RS (indicating the associated NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId) are higher layer configured in SRS-ResourceSet. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and 1_1 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and the SRSResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and \\( 1 \\_2 \\) are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2. A UE is not expected to update the SRS precoding information if the gap from the last symbol of the reception of the aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS resource and the first symbol of the aperiodic SRS transmission is less than \\( 42 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) OFDM symbols, where the SCS configuration \\( \\mu \\) is the smallest SCS configuration between the NZP-CSI-RS resource and the SRS transmission.",
