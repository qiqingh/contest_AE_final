The 2-bit SRS request field in DCI format 2_3 indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in clause 7.3 of [5, TS 38.212] and defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB', or indicates the SRS transmission on a set of serving cells configured by higher layers if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA'.  For PUCCH and SRS on the same carrier, a UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying only CSI report(s), or only L1-RSRP report(s), or only L1SINR report(s). A UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured or aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK, link recovery request (as defined in clause 9.24 of [6,38.213]) and/or SR. In the case that SRS is not transmitted due to overlap with PUCCH, only the SRS symbol(s) that overlap with PUCCH symbol(s) are dropped. PUCCH shall not be transmitted when aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted to overlap in the same symbol with PUCCH carrying semi-persistent/periodic CSI report(s) or semi-persistent/periodic L1-RSRP report(s) only, or only L1-SINR report(s).\n---\n- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config\n---\n- a first set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \\( =0 \\) if \\( O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq 2 \\) including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or - a second set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \\( =1 \\), if provided by higher layers, if \\( 2<O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\leq N_{2} \\) where \\( \\mathrm{N}_{2} \\) is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId \\( =1 \\); otherwise \\( N_{2} \\) is equal to 1706 , or\n---\nSR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.  The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining \\( m_{0} \\) as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting \\( m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 \\). For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting \\( b(0)=0 \\).\n---\n- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.  A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include DL\n---\nWhen the UE determines to transmit the second PUCCH, the UE determines a single resource for multiplexing UCI in the second PUCCH as described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2. 9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH\n---\nIf a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in response to a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, the UE does not expect to be provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI.  A UE is configured by maxCodeRate a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR, and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4.\n---\n- if the PUCCH resource for the second PUCCH includes PUCCH format 2, 3, or 4 and additionally includes \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\mathrm{SR} \\) bits of priority \\( 1, O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1} \\) is replaced by \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) where \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) is determined according to clause 9.2.5.1\n---\nA symbol of a slot is equivalent to being configured as hard if an [AB-DU would transmit a SS/PBCH block, PDCCH for Type0-PDCCH CSS sets configured by pdcchConfigSIB1, or a periodic CSI-RS in the symbol of the slot, or would receive a PRACH or a SR in the symbol of the slot.  With reference to slots of an [AB-DU cell, the [AB-DU can be provided an indication of hard, soft or unavailable type per RB set for symbols configured as downlink, uplink or flexible in a slot by Rel-17 frequency-domain IAB-DU-Resource-Configuration-H/S/NA-Config [16, TS 38.473]. The RB set size and the number of RB sets are configured by RB-Set-Configuration [16, TS 38-473]. If an indication of hard, soft or unavailable type is not provided for an RB set of a symbol in a slot, the [AB-DU applies the configuration of hard, soft or unavailable type provided by HSNA Slot Configuration List in gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration [16, TS 38-473] for the RB set of the symbol in the slot. If an indication of hard, soft, or unavailable type is provided for an RB set in a symbol of a slot, the [AB-DU applies the configuration of hard, soft, or unavailable type provided by Rel-17 frequency-domain IAB-DU-Resource-Configuration-H/S/NA-Config [16, TS 38-473] when the [AB-node uses simultaneous transmission and reception in the slot.\n---\n- if \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ}-\\mathrm{ACK}} \\) for obtaining a power of a PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information, as described in clause 7.2.1, as a sum of the \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }} \\) value from clause 9.1.2.1 or clause 9.1.3.3 and the \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }} \\) value from clause 9.1.3.1.  A UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information as described in clauses 9.2 and 9.2.1 through 9.2.5.\n---\n\\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:\n---\nThe Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission. The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured.",
