When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot, if the first symbol of the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time scheduling the PDSCH was received in a later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain resource allocation.  When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \\( 1 \\_1 \\) or DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_1 \\), the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator'\n---\nFor [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17] in pdsch-Config each PDSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \\( K_{0} \\).

If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is indicated re-transmission of PDSCH corresponding to a DL SPS by DCI format 1_1, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 by the DCI is more than one.\n---\nFor pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-rl7 in pusch-Config, each PUSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \\( K_{2} \\).

The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214].  If a UE does not have dedicated RRC configuration, or has an initial UL BWP as an active UL BWP, or is not provided startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation provides a SLIV and a PUSCH mapping type for a PUSCH transmission by indicating\n---\nelse, the UE is provided a SLIV by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, and a PUSCH mapping type by mappingTypeMsgA-PUSCH for a PUSCH transmission.  For mapping one or multiple preambles of a PRACH slot to a PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource, a UE determines a first slot for a first PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainOffset that provides an offset, in number of slots in the active UL BWP, relative to the start of a PUSCH slot including the start of each PRACH slot. The UE does not expect to have a PRACH preamble transmission and a PUSCH transmission with a msgA in a PRACH slot or in a PUSCH slot, or to have overlapping msgA PUSCH occasions for a MsgA PUSCH configuration. The UE expects that a first PUSCH occasion in each slot has a same SLIV for a PUSCH transmission that is provided by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO or msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation [6, TS 38.214].\n---\n- if the UE is provided referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2, for each row index with slot offset \\( K_{0}=0 \\) and PDSCH mapping Type B in a set of row indexes of a table for DCI format 1 _ 2 [6, TS 38.214], for any PDCCH monitoring occasion in any slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\) and with starting symbol \\( S_{0}>0 \\), if \\( S+S_{0}+L \\leq 14 \\) for nomal cyclic prefix and \\( S+S_{0}+L \\leq 12 \\) for extended cyclic prefix, add a new row index in the set of row indexes of the table by replacing the starting symbol \\( S \\) of the row index by \\( S+S_{0} \\) c) on the ratio \\( 2^{\\mu_{\\mathrm{DL}}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{UL}}} \\) between the downlink SCS configuration \\( \\mu_{\\mathrm{DL}} \\) and the uplink SCS configuration \\( \\mu_{\\mathrm{UL}} \\) provided by subcarrierSpacing in BWP-Downlink and BWP-Uplink for the active DL BWP and the active UL BWP, respectively\n---\nNumber of slots (in active UL BWP numerology) containing one or multiple PUSCH occasions, each slot has the same time domain resource allocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A). startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO An index giving valid combinations of start symbol, length and mapping type as start and length indicator (SLIV) for the first msgA PUSCH occasion, for RRC_CONNECTED UEs in non-initial BWP as described in TS 38.214 [19] clause 6.1.2. The network configures the field so that the allocation does not cross the slot boundary. The number of occupied symbols excludes the guard period. If the field is absent, the UE shall use the value in msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A).
