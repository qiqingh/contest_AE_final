The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS\n---\n- is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212]\n---\nwhere \\( P_{\\text {CMAX, } f c}(i) \\) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS 38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( \\mathcal{C} \\) within transmission occasion \\( i, P_{\\text {PRACH, largel, } 46} \\) is the PRACH target reception power PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for the active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( C \\), and \\( P L_{b, f, c} \\) is a pathloss for the active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) based on the DL RS associated with the PRACH transmission on the active DL BWP of serving cell \\( C \\) and calculated by the UE in dB as referenceSignalPower - higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm , where RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] and the higher layer filter configuration is defined in [12, TS 38.331]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE determines \\( P L_{b, f, c} \\) based on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission.\n---\nIf the UE detects a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI and receives a transport block within the window in a corresponding PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\).\n---\nWhen detecting a DCI format in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, as described in [11, TS 38.321], or corresponding PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a TCRNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume the PDCCH carrying the DCI format has the same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format.\n---\nIf the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index \\( r_{\\text {PUCCH }}, 0 \\leq r_{\\text {PUCCH }} \\leq 15 \\), as \\( r_{\\text {PUCCH }}=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2 \\cdot n_{\\text {CCE }, 0}}{N_{\\text {CCE }}}\\right\\rfloor+2 \\cdot \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} \\), where \\( N_{\\text {CCE }} \\) is a number of CCEs in a CORESET of a PDCCH reception with the DCI format, as described in clause 10.1, \\( n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} \\) is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and \\( \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} \\) is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format.  When the PDCCH reception by a UE includes first and second PDCCH candidates from respective first and second search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 , the CORESET and \\( n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} \\) are associated with the search space set having the smaller index. If\n---\n- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH using a resource provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, and the PUCCH transmission is not dropped due to an overlapping with a PUSCH or PUCCH transmission of larger priority and does not have any symbol that overlaps with a symbol indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated, or indicated for a SS/PBCH block by ssbPositionsInBurst, or belonging to a CORESET associated with a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot\n---\nIf a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.  If at least one RE of a PDCCH candidate for a UE on the serving cell overlaps with at least one RE of lte-CRSToMatchAround, or of LTE-CRS-PatternList, the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.\n---\nIf the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 .\n---\nIf a UE is provided controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigSIBl or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a search space set from controlResourcesetZero as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions for the search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP.\n---\nFor an initial DL BWP provided by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, if a UE monitors PDCCH according to a Type1-PDCCH CSS set and does not monitor PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE assumes that the initial DL BWP does not include SS/PBCH blocks or the CORESET with index 0 .
