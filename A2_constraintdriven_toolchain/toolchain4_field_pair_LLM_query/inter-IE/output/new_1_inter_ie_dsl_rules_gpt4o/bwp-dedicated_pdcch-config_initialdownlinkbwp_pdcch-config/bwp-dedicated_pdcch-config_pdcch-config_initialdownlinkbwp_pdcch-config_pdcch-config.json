HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} \\) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process.

When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID.\n---\nIf the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in different ControlResourceSets, and the UE receives the DM-RS for \\( \\mathrm{PDSCH}(\\mathrm{s}) \\) and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH(s) and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable.\n---\n- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet\n---\nA UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.\n---\n- searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon when pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH are not provided, for a DCI format \\( 4 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI\n---\n\\hline PDCCH-OfSpcell & The field is mandatory present if the PUCCH-TPC-CommandConfig is provided in the PDCCH-Config for the SpCell.

If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].\n---\nIf a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex. For a ControlResourceSet without coresetPoollndex, the UE may assume that the ControlResourceSet is assigned with coresetPoollndex as 0 . When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], ControlResourceSets corresponding to different coresetPoolIndex values may be associated with different physical cell [Ds via activated TCI states of the ControlResourceSets, where ControlResourceSets corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and ControlResourceSets corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, the following operations are allowed:\n---\n- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets,",
