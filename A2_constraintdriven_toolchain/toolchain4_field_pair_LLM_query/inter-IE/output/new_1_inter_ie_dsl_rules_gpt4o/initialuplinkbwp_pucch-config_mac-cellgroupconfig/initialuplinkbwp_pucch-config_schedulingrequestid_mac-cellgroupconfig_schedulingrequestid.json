The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\nA UE can be provided, by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.24 for the UE to transmit PUCCH [11, TS 38.321]. If the PCell or the PSCell is associated with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\), and with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\), the UE can be provided by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR. If the UE is provided only the first configuration, the UE transmits a PUCCH with LRR for either set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\). If the UE is provided both the first and second configurations, the UE uses the first configuration to transmt a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and the second configuration to transmit a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1}[11 \\), TS 38.321].\n---\n- \\( \\operatorname{BPRE}(\\mathrm{i})=\\left(O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{CRC}}(i)\\right) / N_{R E}(i) \\) - \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}(i) \\) is a number of HARQ-ACK information bits that the UE determines as described in clause 9.1.2.1 or 16.5.1.1 for Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook and as described in clause 9.1.3.1 or 9.1.3.3 or 16.5.2.1 for Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook, or as described in clause 9.1.4 for Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook.

For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 .\n---\nIf \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ}-\\mathrm{ACK}} \\) for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }}=\\sum_{c=0}^{N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\text {DL }} \\sum_{m=0}^{M_{c}-1} N_{m, c}^{\\text {received }}}+ \\sum_{c=0}^{N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL}}{ }^{-1}} \\sum_{m=0}^{M_{c}-1} N_{m, c}^{\\text {received, CBG }} \\) where\n---\nfor PDSCH receptions scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions, or for SPS PDSCH reception, or for a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, and if \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ} \\text {-ACK }} \\) for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as\n---\nIf \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ}-\\mathrm{ACK}, g} \\) for group \\( g \\) and a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }(g+1) \\bmod 2} \\) for group \\( (g+1) \\bmod 2 \\) as described in clause 9.1.3.1 where \\( N_{\\mathrm{SPS}, c} \\) is included in \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ}-\\mathrm{ACK}, g} \\) and, if \\( q=1 \\) and \\( V_{\\mathrm{DAI}}^{(g+1) \\bmod 2} \\neq \\emptyset \\), the UE determines \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }(g+1) \\bmod 2} \\) by setting \\( V_{\\text {DAI } \\mathrm{m}_{\\text {last }}}^{\\mathrm{DL}}=V_{D A I}^{(g+1) \\bmod 2} \\).
