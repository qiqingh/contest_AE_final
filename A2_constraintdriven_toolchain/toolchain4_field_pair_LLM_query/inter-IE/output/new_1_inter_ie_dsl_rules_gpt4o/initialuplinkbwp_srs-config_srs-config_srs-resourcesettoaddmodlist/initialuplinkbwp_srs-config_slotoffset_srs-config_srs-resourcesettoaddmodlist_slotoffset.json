    "evidence": "For an SRS resource configured as periodic or semi-persistent by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, a periodicity \\( T_{\\text {SRS }} \\) (in slots) and slot offset \\( T_{\\text {offset }} \\) are configured according to the higher-layer parameter periodicityAndOffset- \\( p \\) or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRS-Resource [E, or periodicityAndOffset-p or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRSPosResource IE. Candidate slots in which the configured SRS resource may be used for SRS transmission are the slots satisfying\n---\nWhen the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the Time domain resource assignment field value \\( m \\) of the DCI provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{0} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), and the PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.\n---\nFor a periodic or semi-persistent CSI report on PUCCH, the periodicity \\( T_{C S I} \\) (measured in slots) and the slot offset \\( T_{\\text {offset }} \\) are configured by the higher layer parameter reportSlotConfig. Unless specified otherwise, the UE shall transmit the CSI report in frames with SFN \\( n_{f} \\) and slot number within the frame \\( n_{s, f}^{\\mu} \\) satisfying\n---\nWhen aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic reporting, the CSI-RS offset is configured per resource set by the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset or aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16. The CSI-RS triggering offset has the values of \\( \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6, \\ldots, 15,16,24\\} \\) slots. If the UE is not configured with minimumScheduling OffsetKO for any DL BWP and minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 for any UL BWP and if all the associated trigger states do not have the higher layer parameter qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the corresponding TCI states, the CSI-RS triggering offset is fixed to zero. The aperiodic triggering offset of the CSI-[M follows offset of the associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement. The aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted in a slot \\( K_{s}, K_{s}=n+X+\\left(\\frac{N_{\\text {slot, offset, } \\text { PDCCH }}^{\\text {CA }}}{2^{\\mu_{\\text {Offset, } \\text { PDCCH }}}}-\\frac{N_{\\text {slot, } \\text { offset, } \\text { CSIRS }}^{\\text {CA }}}{2^{\\mu_{\\text {Offset, } \\text { CSIRS }}}}\\right) \\). \\( 2^{\\mu \\operatorname{CSIRS}} \\), if UE is configured with ca-SlotOffset for at least one of the triggered and triggering cell, and in slot \\( K_{s}=n+X \\), otherwise, and where\n---\nWhen the UE is scheduled with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_1 \\) with a 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in slot \\( n \\), it shall determine the \\( K_{0 \\mathrm{~mm}} \\) and \\( K_{2 \\mathrm{mn}} \\) values, if configured respectively, to be applied, while the previously applied \\( K_{0 \\mathrm{mn}} \\) and/or \\( K_{2 \\mathrm{mn}} \\) values are applied until the new values take effect. If the DCI in slot \\( n \\) also indicates an active DL (UL) BWP change for a serving cell, the indicated \\( K_{0 \\mathrm{~mm}}\\left(K_{2 \\mathrm{mn}}\\right) \\) value in the new active DL (UL) BWP, if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI. Otherwise, change of applied minimum scheduling offset restriction indication carried by DCI in slot \\( n \\), shall be applied in slot \\( n+X \\) of the scheduling cell. The UE does not expect to be scheduled with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_1 \\) with 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field indicating another change to \\( K_{0 \\mathrm{~min}} \\) or \\( K_{2 \\mathrm{~min}} \\) for the same active BWP of the scheduled cell before slot \\( n+X \\) of the scheduling cell.\n---\nIf the \\( \\mu_{\\mathrm{PDCCH}}<\\mu_{\\mathrm{PDSCH}} \\), the UE is expected to receive the scheduled PDSCH, if the first symbol in the PDSCH allocation, including the DM-RS, as defined by the slot offset \\( K_{0} \\) and the start and length indicator SLIV of the scheduling DCI starts no earlier than the first symbol of the slot of the PDSCH reception starting at least \\( N_{\\text {pasch }} \\) PDCCH symbols after the end of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH , not taking into account the effect of receive timing difference between the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell.\n---\nWhen the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and no CSI report by a DCI or by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, or the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and a CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a DCI, the 'Time domain resource assignment' field value \\( m \\) of the DCI or the PUSCH time resource allocation field value \\( m \\) of the RAR UL grant or of the fallbackRAR UL grant provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocated table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{2} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), the PUSCH mapping type, the number of slots used for TBS determination (if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present in the resource allocation table), and the number of repetitions (if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission.\n---\n- If ca-SlotOffset is configured, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in the ( \\( t+1 \\) )-th available slot counting from slot\n---\nIf the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation for a transport block, including the DM-RS, as defined by the slot offset \\( K_{2} \\) and \\( K_{0} \\) Iset, if configured, and the start \\( S \\) and length \\( L \\) of the PUSCH allocation indicated by Time domain resource assignment' of the scheduling DCI and including the effect of the timing advance, is no earlier than at symbol \\( L_{2} \\), where \\( L_{2} \\) is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting \\( T_{\\text {prom } 2}=\\max \\left(\\left(N_{2}+d_{2,1}+d_{2}\\right)(2048+144) \\cdot \\kappa 2^{-\\mu} \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{c}}+T_{\\text {ext }}+T_{\\text {mink }}, d_{2,2}\\right) \\) after the end of the reception of the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH, then the UE shall transmit the transport block. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\nWhen the cast type is groupcast or broadcast as indicated by upper layer, or the cast type is unicast for the reception of Direct Link Establishment Request message [28] or ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request message [29] as indicated by upper layer, or for the reception of discovery message [26], the \\( s l \\)-drx-StartOffset and \\( s l \\)-drx-SlotOffset are derived from the following equations:\n---\n- if the UE is provided referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2, for each row index with slot offset \\( K_{0}=0 \\) and PDSCH mapping Type B in a set of row indexes of a table for DCI format 1 _ 2 [6, TS 38.214], for any PDCCH monitoring occasion in any slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\) and with starting symbol \\( S_{0}>0 \\), if \\( S+S_{0}+L \\leq 14 \\) for nomal cyclic prefix and \\( S+S_{0}+L \\leq 12 \\) for extended cyclic prefix, add a new row index in the set of row indexes of the table by replacing the starting symbol \\( S \\) of the row index by \\( S+S_{0} \\)\n---\nIf a UE detects a DCI format indicating an active UL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in the scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.",
