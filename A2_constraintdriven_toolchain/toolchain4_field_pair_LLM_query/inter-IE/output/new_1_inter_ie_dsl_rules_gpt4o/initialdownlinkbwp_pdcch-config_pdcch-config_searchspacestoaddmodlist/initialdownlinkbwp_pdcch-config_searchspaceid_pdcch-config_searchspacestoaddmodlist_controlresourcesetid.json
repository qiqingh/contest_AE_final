If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, where the UE is provided two coresetPoollndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoollndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. The UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), the UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include up to a number of \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\) RS indexes indicated by capabilityparametername.

If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index.\n---\nA UE is not required to monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0/0A/1/2-PDCCH CSS set when the active TCI state for a corresponding CORESET is not associated with physCellld in ServingCellConfigCommon.  If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.\n---\n- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that includes a CORESET with index 0 , as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block, or\n---\nThis field may indicate that this cell does not provide S/B1 and that there is hence no CORESET\\#0 configured in M/B (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).\n---\n- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI;\n---\nA UE not attempting to detect a PDCCH in a CORESET shall not make any assumptions on the presence or absence of DM-RS in the CORESET.  In absence of CSI-RS configuration, and unless otherwise configured, the UE may assume PDCCH DM-RS and SS/PBCH block to be quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters.\n---\nFor a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.\n---\nFor PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .\n---\nIf a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH.\n---\nWhen the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subrame, } \\mu}+ \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K} a c}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\( \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} \\) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is provided by \\( K \\)-Mac or \\( k_{\\text {mac }}=0 \\) if \\( K \\)-Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.",
