If the higher layer parameter PTRS-DownlinkConfig indicates that the frequency density thresholds \\( N_{R B i}=N_{R B i+1} \\), then the frequency density \\( K_{P I R S} \\) of the associated row where both these thresholds appear in Table 5.1.6.3-2 is disabled.\n---\n- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements.\n---\nIf the higher layer parameter PTRS-UplinkConfig indicates that the time density thresholds ptrs-MCS: ptrs-MCS \\( S_{i+1} \\), then the time density \\( L_{P T R S} \\) of the associated row where both these thresholds appear in Table 6.2.3.1-1 is disabled. If the higher layer parameter frequencyDensity in PTRS-UplinkConfig indicates that the frequency density thresholds \\( N_{R B, i}= N_{R B, i+1} \\), then the frequency density \\( K_{P T R S} \\) of the associated row where both these thresholds appear in Table 6.2.3.1-2 is disabled.\n---\nPresence and frequency density of DL PT-RS as a function of Scheduled BW. If the field is absent, the UE uses K_PT-RS = 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.6.3, table 5.1.6.3-2).\n---\nPresence and frequency density of SL PT-RS as a function of scheduled BW. If the field is not configured, the UE uses K_PT-RS \\( =2 \\)\n---\nThe value of \\( \\rho \\) is given by the higher-layer parameter density in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E or the CSI-RSCellMobility I \\( E \\) and the number of ports \\( X \\) is given by the higher-layer parameter nrofPorts. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRS-ResourceSet [E, the density \\( \\rho=3 \\) and number of ports \\( X=1 \\).\n---\n- A UE is not expected to be configured with csi-ReportingBand which contains a subband where a CSI-RS resource linked to the CSI Report setting has the frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB in the subband less than the configured density of the CSI-RS resource.\n---\n- density in resourceMapping defines CSI-RS frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB, and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density value of \\( 1 / 2 \\), where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4 - 1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation indicated in density is with respect to the common resource block grid.\n---\n- and the UE may be configured PT-RS time density \\( L_{P I-R S}=2 \\) with the higher layer parameter timeDensityTransformPrecoding. Otherwise, the UE shall assume \\( L_{P T-R S}=1 \\).\n---\nThe UE expects single port RS in the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\). The UE expects single-port or two-port CSI-RS with frequency density equal to 1 or 3 REs per RB in the set \\( \\bar{q}_{1} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\). The thresholds \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\text {out }, \\mathrm{LR}} \\) and \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{LR}} \\) correspond to the default value of rimInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold, as described in [10, TS 38.133] for \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\text {out }} \\), and to the value provided by rsrp-ThresholdSSB or rsrp-ThresholdBFR, respectively.\n---\nWhen a UE is receiving PDSCH for retransmission, if the UE is scheduled with an MCS index greater than V, where \\( \\mathrm{V}=28 \\) for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-1 and Table 5.1.3.1-3, and \\( \\mathrm{V}=27 \\) for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2, and \\( \\mathrm{V}=26 \\) for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-4 respectively, the MCS for the PT-RS time-density determination is obtained from the DCI received for the same transport block in the initial transmission, which is smaller than or equal to V .",
