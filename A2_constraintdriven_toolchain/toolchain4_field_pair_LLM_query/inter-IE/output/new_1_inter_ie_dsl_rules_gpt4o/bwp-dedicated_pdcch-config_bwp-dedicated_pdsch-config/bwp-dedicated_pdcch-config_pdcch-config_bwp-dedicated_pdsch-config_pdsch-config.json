A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe. - If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:\n---\nA UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].",
