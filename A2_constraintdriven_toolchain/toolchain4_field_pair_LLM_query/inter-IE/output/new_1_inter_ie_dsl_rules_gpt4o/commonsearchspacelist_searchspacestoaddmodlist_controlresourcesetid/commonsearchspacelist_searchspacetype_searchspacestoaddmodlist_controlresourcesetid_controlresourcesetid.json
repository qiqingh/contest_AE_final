The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS\n---\n- is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212]\n---\nwhere \\( P_{\\text {CMAX, } f c}(i) \\) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS 38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( \\mathcal{C} \\) within transmission occasion \\( i, P_{\\text {PRACH, largel, } 46} \\) is the PRACH target reception power PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for the active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( C \\), and \\( P L_{b, f, c} \\) is a pathloss for the active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) based on the DL RS associated with the PRACH transmission on the active DL BWP of serving cell \\( C \\) and calculated by the UE in dB as referenceSignalPower - higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm , where RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] and the higher layer filter configuration is defined in [12, TS 38.331].
