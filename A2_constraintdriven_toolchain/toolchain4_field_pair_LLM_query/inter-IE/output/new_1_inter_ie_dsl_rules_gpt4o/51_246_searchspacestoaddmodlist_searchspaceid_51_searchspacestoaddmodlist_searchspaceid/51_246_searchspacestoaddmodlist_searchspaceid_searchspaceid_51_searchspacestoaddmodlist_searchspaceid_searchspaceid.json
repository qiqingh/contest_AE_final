    "evidence": "For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant across the bandwidth. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant over SSS carried in different SS/PBCH blocks. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume that the ratio of SSS EPRE to PBCH DM-RS EPRE is 0 dB .\n---\nWhen receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.  When receiving PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI, or MSGB-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE used for RACH association as applicable, and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI in response to a random access procedure triggered by a PDCCH order which triggers contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell [10, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of the received PDCCH order and the DM-RS ports of the corresponding PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI are quasi co-located with the same SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.\n---\nThe UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot, if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was not contained within the first three symbols of the slot. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], if the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH with mapping Type A were received in the same slot as the PDSCH, both PDCCH candidates are expected to be contained within the first three symbols of the slot.\n---\n\\hline \\multicolumn{6}{|l|}{Note 1: If the PDSCH was scheduled with SI-RNTI in PDCCH Type0 common search space, the UE may assume that this PDSCH resource allocation is not applied} \\\\\n---\nFor a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.\n---\nFor PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .\n---\nWhen receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system information indicator in DCI is set to 0 , the UE shall assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used by the UE for a reception of the PDSCH.\n---\nIf a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the resources corresponding to a union of the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH and the associated PDCCH DM-RS are not available for the PDSCH. When precoderGranularity configured in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to 'allContiguousRBs', the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DMRS in REGs of the PDCCH.\n---\nWhen the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subrame, } \\mu}+ \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K} a c}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\( \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} \\) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is provided by \\( K \\)-Mac or \\( k_{\\text {mac }}=0 \\) if \\( K \\)-Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.\n---\n- 'typeC' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same SS/PBCH block.\n---\nIf the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'none' and if the CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) contains a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet that is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition and without the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE can only be configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer parameter nrofPorts for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block.\n---\nIf a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility and associatedSSB, the UE may base the timing of the CSI-RS resource on the timing of the cell given by the cellld of the CSI-RS resource configuration. Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH block is configured but not detected by the UE, the UE is not required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource. The higher layer parameter isQuasiColocated indicates whether the associated SS/PBCH block given by the associatedSSB and the CSI-RS resource(s) are quasi colocated with respect to 'typeD', when applicable.",
