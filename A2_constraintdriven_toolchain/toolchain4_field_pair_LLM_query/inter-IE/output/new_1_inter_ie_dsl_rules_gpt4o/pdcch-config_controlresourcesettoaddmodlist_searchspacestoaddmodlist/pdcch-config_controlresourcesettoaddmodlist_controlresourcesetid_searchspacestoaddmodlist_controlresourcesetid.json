If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS\n---\n- is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212]\n---\n- the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP, if CORESETs are provided in the active DL BWP of serving cell \\( c \\).

If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE determines \\( P L_{b, f, c} \\) based on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission.\n---\nIn response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321].

The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Typel-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by raResponseWindow.\n---\nWhen detecting a DCI format in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, as described in [11, TS 38.321], or corresponding PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a TCRNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume the PDCCH carrying the DCI format has the same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format.\n---\nIf the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index \\( r_{\\text {PUCCH }}, 0 \\leq r_{\\text {PUCCH }} \\leq 15 \\), as \\( r_{\\text {PUCCH }}=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2 \\cdot n_{\\text {CCE }, 0}}{N_{\\text {CCE }}}\\right\\rfloor+2 \\cdot \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} \\), where \\( N_{\\text {CCE }} \\) is a number of CCEs in a CORESET of a PDCCH reception with the DCI format, as described in clause 10.1, \\( n_{\\text {CCE }, 0} \\) is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and \\( \\Delta_{\\text {PRI }} \\) is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format.\n---\n- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH using a resource provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, and the PUCCH transmission is not dropped due to an overlapping with a PUSCH or PUCCH transmission of larger priority and does not have any symbol that overlaps with a symbol indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated, or indicated for a SS/PBCH block by ssbPositionsInBurst, or belonging to a CORESET associated with a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot",
