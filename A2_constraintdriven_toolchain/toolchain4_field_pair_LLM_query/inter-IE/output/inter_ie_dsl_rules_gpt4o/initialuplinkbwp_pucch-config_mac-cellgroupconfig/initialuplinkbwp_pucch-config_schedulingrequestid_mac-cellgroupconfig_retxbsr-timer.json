All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and \\( s l \\)-retx-BSR-Timer and \\( s l \\) -periodic-BSR-Timer shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.  NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.",
