    "evidence": "For the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, as described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE does not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld.  For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR, a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot \\( n \\) and according to antenna port quasi colocation parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot \\( n+4+2^{\\mu} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\), where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is a number of slots provided by \\( K-M a c[12, T S 38.331] \\) or \\( k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 \\) if \\( K-M a c \\) is not provided, within a window configured by BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld and for corresponding PDSCH reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList. After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.\n---\n- if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET, or has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI states for the CORESET by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure, or for a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19 for a same HARQ process;",
