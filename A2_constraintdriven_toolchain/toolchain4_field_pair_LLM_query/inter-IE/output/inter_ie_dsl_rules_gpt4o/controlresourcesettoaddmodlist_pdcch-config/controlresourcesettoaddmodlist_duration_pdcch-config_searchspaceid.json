When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.\n---\nIn any slot, the UE is not expected to have more active CSI-RS ports or active CSI-RS resources in active BWPs than reported as capability. NZP CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that transmission of SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame is within a discovery burst transmission window that starts from the first symbol of the first slot in a half-frame. The UE can be provided per serving cell by discoveryBurstWindowLength a duration of the discovery burst transmission window. If discoveryBurstWindowLength is not provided, the UE assumes that the duration of the discovery burst transmission window is a half frame. For a serving cell, the UE assumes that a periodicity of the discovery burst transmission window is same as a periodicity of half frames for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst. If MSB \\( k, k \\geq 1 \\), of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1 , the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es)\n---\nIf the UE does not detect the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \\( N_{T, 1}+0.75 \\mathrm{msec} \\) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \\( N_{T, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 assuming \\( \\mu \\) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), the corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DMRS is configured, and the corresponding PRACH.

The UE does not expect to be indicated to transmit the PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information at a time that is prior to a time when the UE applies a TA command that is provided by the transport block. If the UE does not detect the DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit only PRACH according to Type-1 random access procedure or to transmit both PRACH and PUSCH according to Type-2 random access procedure [11, TS 38.321]. If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \\( N_{\\mathrm{T}, 1}+0.75 \\mathrm{msec} \\) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \\( N_{\\mathrm{T}, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured.

The UE may assume a minimum time between the last symbol of a PDSCH reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant and the first symbol of a corresponding PUSCH transmission scheduled by the RAR UL grant is equal to \\( N_{T, 1}+N_{T, 2}+0.5 \\mathrm{msec} \\), where \\( N_{T, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, \\( N_{T, 2} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{2} \\) symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] and, for determining the minimum time, the UE considers that \\( N_{1} \\) and \\( N_{2} \\) correspond to the smaller of the SCS configurations for the PDSCH and the PUSCH. For \\( \\mu=0 \\), the UE assumes \\( N_{1,0}=14[6, \\mathrm{TS} 38.214] \\).\n---\nIn response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant when a UE has not been provided a C-RNTI, the UE attempts to detect a DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI scheduling a PDSCH that includes a UE contention resolution identity [11, TS 38.321]. In response to the PDSCH reception with the UE contention resolution identity, the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH. The PUCCH transmission is within a same active UL BWP as the PUSCH transmission. A minimum time between the last symbol of the PDSCH reception and the first symbol of the corresponding PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information is equal to \\( N_{T, 1}+0.5 \\mathrm{msec} .

If CO-DurationsPerCell is not provided, the remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell is a number of slots, starting from the slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 , 0 , that the SFIindex field value provides corresponding slot formats - a reference SCS configuration for co-DurationList, by subcarrierSpacing-r16 - a location of a search space set group switching flag field in DCI format 2 _ 0 , by SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger, that indicates a group from two groups of search space sets for PDCCH monitoring for scheduling for the serving cell or the set of serving cells, provided by CellGroupsForSwitching, as described in clause 10.4.\n---\nIf a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\), provided to a UE for the search space set \\( S \\) by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot.\n---\nA UE does not expect to detect a DCI format indicating an active DL BWP change or an active UL BWP change for a scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2) in a slot other than the first slot of a set of slots for the DL SCS of the scheduling cell that overlaps with a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit, respectively, for an active BWP change in a different cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2).  A UE expects to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active UL BWP change or an active DL BWP change only if a corresponding PDCCH is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot. If the UE detects the DCI format from two PDCCH receptions in search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \\( s_{j} \\) and \\( s_{i} \\), respectively, as described in clause 10.1 , the UE considers the PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format to be the one from the two PDCCH receptions that ends later.\n---\nIf a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\) is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats \\( 2-5 \\) indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot.

The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the above condition.\n---\nIf \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) in the same frequency (for intra frequency cell reselection) or different frequency (for inter frequency cell reselection), the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc2-LP configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtc configuration for that frequency. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell or serving cell (for cell reselection) meeting the above condition.  If smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtcl to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent the UE measures on all SS-blocks.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent in VarMeas/dieConfig, the UE measures on all SSblocks.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.\n---\nFor IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\). The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\). The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). freqMonitorLocations Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set.\n---\nFor an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT:each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet; for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent. SearchSpaceLinkingld This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to \\( n \\)-th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The firstfleftmost bit corresponds to SS block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS block index 1 , and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the IAB-MT measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.\n---\nBitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the k -th bit is set to 1 , the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the SMTC measurement duration with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to \\( \\mathrm{k}-1 \\) may be transmitted; if the kt -th bit is set to 0 , the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k -th bit is set to 0 , where \\( \\mathrm{k}> \\) ssb-PositionQCL-Common and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. If ssb-PositionQCL is configured with a value smaller than ssb-PositionQCL-Common, only the leftmost K bits ( \\( \\mathrm{K}=s s b \\)-PositionQCL) are applicable for the corresponding cell.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]).",
