For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with \\( K \\geq 1 \\) SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306].

The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet.

The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set.

If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot \\( k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} \\) where \\( k \\) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH\n---\n- If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines the referenceSignal values in PUCCHPathlossReferenceRS that are indicated in the one or two sets of power control parameter - If the UE is provided pathlossReferenceRSs and is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo and is not provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, the UE obtains the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS from the pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id with index 0 in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS where the RS resource is either on the primary cell or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking\n---\nA UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell [11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the first DCI format scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block since a power headroom report was triggered if the power headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format. Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus \\( T_{\\text {proc. } 2}=T_{\\text {proc. } 2} \\) where \\( T_{\\text {proc. } 2} \\) is determined according to [6, TS 38.214] assuming \\( d_{2, l}=1, d_{2,2}=0 \\), and with \\( \\mu_{D L} \\) corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using the configured grant.\n---\n3> if any of the reference signal(s) that are used for radio link monitoring are reconfigured by the received spCellConfigDedicated:\n---\n\\( O f n \\) is the measurement object specific offset of the reference signal of the neighbour cell (i.e. offsetMO as defined within measObjectNR corresponding to the neighbour cell).\n---\nNOTE 1: The parameters of the reference signal(s) of the cell(s) that triggers the event are indicated in the measObjectNR associated to the event which may be different from the measObjectNR of the NR SpCell.\n---\nThe purpose of this procedure is to modify a PC5-RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release sidelink DRBs, to (re-)configure NR sidelink measurement and reporting, to (re-)configure sidelink CSI reference signal resources and CSI reporting latency bound.\n---\nThe ID of a NZP-CSI-RS-Resource configured in the CS/-MeasConfig of this serving cell. This reference signal determines a candidate beam for beam failure recovery (BFR).\n---\nIndicates the reference signal used as PUSCH pathloss reference for the second SRS resource set. When this field is present, pathlossReferencelndex indicates the reference signal used as PUSCH pathloss reference for the first SRS resource set\n---\nThe IE PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id is an ID for a reference signal (RS) configured as PUCCH pathloss reference (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.2).\n---\nA set of Reference Signals (e.g. a CSI-RS config or a SS block) to be used for PUCCH pathloss estimation. Up to maxNrofPUCCH-PathlossReference-RSs may be configured. If the field is not configured, the UE uses the SSB as reference signal (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.2). The set includes Reference Signals indicated in pathlossReferenceRSs (without suffix) and in pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610. The UE maintains pathlossReferenceRSs and pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610 separately: Receiving pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610 set to release releases only the entries that were configured by pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610, and receiving pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610 set to setup replaces only the entries that were configured by pathlossReferenceRSs-v1610 with the newly signalled entries.\n---\nTimer for beam failure detection (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17). See also the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig IE. Value in number of \"Qout, LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection\" Reference Signal (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6). Value pbfd1 corresponds to \\( 1 Q_{o u t, L R} \\) reporting period of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal, value pbfd2 corresponds to 2 Qout,LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal and so on.\n---\nA reference signal that the UE shall use for radio link monitoring or beam failure detection (depending on the indicated purpose). Only periodic 1-port CSI-RS can be configured on SCell for beam failure detection purpose.\n---\nDetermines whether the UE shall monitor the associated reference signal for the purpose of cell- and/or beam failure detection. For SCell, network only configures the value to beamFailure.\n---\nThe IE SCellActivationRS-Config is used to configure a Reference Signal for efficient activation of the SCell where the IE is included (see TS 38.214 [19], clause x.y.z). Usage of an SCellActivationRS-Config is indicated by including its scellActivationRS-Id in the Enhanced SCell activation MAC CE (see TS 38.321 [3] clause 6.1.3.55).\n---\nThe IE SRS-Config is used to configure sounding reference signal transmissions. The configuration defines a list of SRS-Resources, a list of SRS-PosResources, a list of SRSPosResourceSets and a list of SRS-ResourceSets. Each resource set defines a set of SRS-Resources or SRS-PosResources. The network triggers the transmission of the set of SRS-Resources or SRS-PosResources using a configured aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger (L1 DCI).\n---\nThe IE TCI-State associates one or two DL reference signals with a corresponding quasi-colocation (QCL) type. If additionalPCI is configured for the reference signal, same value is configured for both DL reference signals.\n---\nThe UE's serving cell in which the referenceSignal is configured. If the field is absent, it applies to the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured. The RS can be located on a serving cell other than the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured only if the qc/-Type is configured as typeC or typeD. See TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5.\n---\nThis field indicates the filtering coefficient for long-term measurement and reference signal power derivation used for sidelink open-loop power control.",
