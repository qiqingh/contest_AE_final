If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\). The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\).

Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP.
