Unless specified otherwise, the UE may assume that the PDSCH DM-RS within the same CDM group are quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and spatial Rx (when applicable). The UE may assume that DMRS ports associated with a TCI state as described in clause 5.1.6.2 of [6, TS 38.214] of a PDSCH are QCL with QCL Type A, Type D (when applicable) and average gain.\n---\nWhen the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subrame, } \\mu}+ \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K} a c}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\( \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} \\) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is provided by \\( K \\)-Mac or \\( k_{\\text {mac }}=0 \\) if \\( K \\)-Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.\n---\nIf a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\), and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\). When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL.\n---\n- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the qcl-Type is set to 'typeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers).\n---\n- For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi co-location type(s), as described in clause 5.1.5, through higher layer signaling of qcl-info which contains a list of references to TCIState's for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the CSI triggering state. If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP.\n---\n- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.12 of [10, TS 38.321], for CSI-RS resource set(s) for channel measurement and CSI-[M/NZP CSI-RS resource set(s) for interference measurement associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the selection command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions (including QCL assumptions provided by a list of reference to TCI-State's, one per activated resource) on CSI-RS/CSI-[M transmission corresponding to the configured CSI-RS/CSI-[Mresource configuration(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+ 3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }, \\mu}+\\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu_{K}}{ }^{\\text {rac }}} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \\( \\mu_{K_{\\text {mac }}} \\) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is provided by \\( K-M a c \\) or \\( k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 \\) if \\( K-M a c \\) is not provided. If a TCI-State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS can be an SS/PBCH block, periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS located in same or different CC/DL BWP.\n---\n- qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS contains a reference to a TCI-State indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the TCI-State is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic located in the same or different CC/DL BWP. The reference RS may additionally be an SS/PBCH block associated with a PCI different from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nFor the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) or \\( 0 \\_1 \\), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState.

The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter \\( t r s \\)-Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.  If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info.

The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info.

If more than one CORESETs are associated with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in clause 10.1.\n---\nA UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList and a set \\( \\bar{q}_{1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList or candidateBeamRSListExt or candidateBeamRSSCellList for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. Instead of the sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1} \\), for each BWP of a serving cell, the UE can be provided respective two sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes that can be activated by a MAC CE [11 TS 38.321] and corresponding two sets \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList l and candidateBeamRSList2, respectively, for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell.

If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the RS resource index \\( q_{d} \\) based on the first activated TCI state. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a same \\( q_{d} \\) applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple slots.\n---\nIf a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower.  If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasicollocated with as described in clause 10.1, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) is associated with a periodic CSI-RS configuration as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is obtained by ss-PBCH-BlockPower and powerControlOffsetSS where powerControlOffsetSS provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB .

The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.  For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a PDCCH in a Typel-PDCCH CSS set is not configured with same qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties [6, TS 38.214] with a DM-RS for monitoring the PDCCH in the Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in the USS set, and if the PDCCH or an associated PDSCH overlaps in at least one symbol with a PDCCH the UE monitors in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with an associated PDSCH.\n---\n- a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent random access procedure not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure, if no MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state for the CORESET is received after the most recent random access procedure, or a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19.  For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 , if a UE is provided a single TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one or two of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the one or more DL RS configured by the TCI states. For a CORESET with index 0 , the UE expects that a CSI-RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in a TCI state indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET is provided by a SS/PBCH block\n---\nFor a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 , if a UE is provided a single TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one or two of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the one or more DL RS configured by the TCI states.
