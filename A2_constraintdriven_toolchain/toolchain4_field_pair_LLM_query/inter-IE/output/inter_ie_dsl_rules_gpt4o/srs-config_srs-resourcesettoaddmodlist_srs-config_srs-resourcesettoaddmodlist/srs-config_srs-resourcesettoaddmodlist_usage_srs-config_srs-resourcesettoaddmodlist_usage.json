The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter \\( t r s \\)-Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.  If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\n- when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot \\( n \\), the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set.\n---\nFor the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) or \\( 0 \\_1 \\), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nWhen only one SRS resource set is configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', SRI and TPMI are given by the DCI fields of one SRS resource indicator and one Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2 or given by srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers according to clause 6.1.2.3. The TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3-1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The indicated SRI in slot \\( n \\) is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI.  When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', one or two SRI(s), and one or two TPMI(s) are given by the DCI fields of two SRS resource indicator and two Precoding information and number of layers in clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of [5, TS 38.212] for DCI format 0_1 and 0_2. The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) and TPMI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6-1.2.1. Each TPMI, based on indicated codepoint of SRS Resource Set indicator, is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the corresponding SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured for the applicable SRS resource set, or if a single SRS resource is configured for the applicable SRS resource set TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource. For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot \\( n \\) is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.\n---\n- if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 0 ', the UE determines two values of \\( P_{0_{-} u e \\text { pusch }, b_{1}, f, c}(j) \\) from the p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld values in SRI-PUSCHPowerControl that are mapped to the first SRI field value corresponding to the first SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook' and to a second value, that is associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, corresponding to the second SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook'. -

If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook' and the DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields, the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \\( q_{d} \\) from respective first and second values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that are mapped to the first SRI value corresponding to the first SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook', and the value, associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, corresponding to the second SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook'.\n---\n- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook', is provided SRI-PUSCHPowerControl, and a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for -

When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'noncodebook', the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) to transmit corresponding to each SRS resource set is determined based on SRI(s) corresponding to the associated SRS resource set or higher layer parameter sri-ResourceIndicator or sriResourceIndicator 2 corresponding to the associated SRS resource set in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. A UE is configured with the PT-RS port index for each configured SRS resource by the higher layer parameter ptrs-PortIndex configured by SRS-Config if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in DMRSUplinkConfig.

When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.\n---\n- the UE receives a downlink DCI, a group common DCI, or an uplink DCI based command where a codepoint of the DCI may trigger one or more SRS resource set(s). For SRS in a resource set with usage set to 'codebook' or 'antennaSwitching', the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is \\( N_{2} \\) symbols and an additional time duration \\( T_{\\text {switch- }} \\) Otherwise, the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is \\( N_{2}+14 \\) symbols and an additional time duration \\( T_{\\text {switch }} \\). The minimal time interval unit of OFDM symbol is counted based on the minimum subcarrier spacing given by \\( \\min \\left(\\mu_{P D C C H}, \\mu_{U L L}\\right) \\) where \\( \\mu_{U L} \\) is given by \\( \\min \\left(\\mu_{U L, c a r n e r}, \\mu_{U L, c a r r e r}, \\mu_{S R S}\\right) \\) when the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL' for uplink carrier aggregation, and by \\( \\mu_{S R S} \\) otherwise. \\( \\mu_{S R S} \\) and \\( \\mu_{P D C C H} \\) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command respectively.\n---\n- one CSI-RS for tracking with higher layer parameter pdc-Info for \\( \\mathrm{Rx}-\\mathrm{Tx} \\) time difference estimation at UE side and one SRS resource set with usage-pdc, or\n---\n- for transmission of an SRS resource set configured with usage-pdc, the UE follows the procedures for SRS transmission defined in Clause 6.2.1.\n---\n3> set the iab-IPv4-AddressNumReq to the number of [Pv4 addresses requested per specific usage;\n---\n4> set the iab-IPv6-AddressNumReq to the number of IPv6 addresses requested per specific usage;\n---\n4> set the iab-IPv6-AddressNumReq to the number of IPv6 addresses requested per specific usage; 3> else if [Pv6 address prefixes are requested: \\( 4> \\) set the iab-IPv6-AddressPrefixReq to true per specific usage;\n---\nUsage of the text \"Network always configures the UE with a value for this field\" in the field description indicates that the network has to provide a value for the field in this or in a previous message based on delta configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not imply a mandatory presence of the field.",
