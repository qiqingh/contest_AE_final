The SRS-ResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and 1_1 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and the SRSResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and \\( 1 \\_2 \\) are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2. A UE is not expected to update the SRS precoding information if the gap from the last symbol of the reception of the aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS resource and the first symbol of the aperiodic SRS transmission is less than \\( 42 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) OFDM symbols, where the SCS configuration \\( \\mu \\) is the smallest SCS configuration between the NZP-CSI-RS resource and the SRS transmission.\n---\n- zero or two SRS resource sets each configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic', if the UE is not indicating a capability for extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration, or zero or one or two SRS resource or four SRS resource sets each configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration]. In the case of two resource sets a total of four SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. The two sets are each configured with two SRS resources, or one set is configured with one SRS resource and the other set is configured with three SRS resources. In the case of four resource sets, if UE is capable if supporting four sets, a total of four SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of four different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given four sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. The four sets are each configured with one SRS resource. The UE shall expect that the two or four sets are both configured with the same values of the higher layer parameters alpha, p0, pathlossReferenceRS, and srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates in SRS-ResourceSet. The UE shall expect that the value of the higher layer parameter aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger or the value of an entry in AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList in each SRS-ResourceSet is the same, and the value of the higher layer parameter slotOffset in each SRS-ResourceSet is different. Or,\n---\n- zero or two SRS resource sets each configured with higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' and with a total of four SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. The two sets are each configured with two SRS resources, or one set is configured with one SRS resource and the other set is configured with three SRS resources. The UE shall expect that the two sets are both configured with the same values of the higher layer parameters alpha, p0, pathlossReferenceRS, and srsPowerControlAdjustmentStates in SRS-ResourceSet.

Or,\n---\nThe IE SRS-Config is used to configure sounding reference signal transmissions. The configuration defines a list of SRS-Resources, a list of SRS-PosResources, a list of SRSPosResourceSets and a list of SRS-ResourceSets. Each resource set defines a set of SRS-Resources or SRS-PosResources. The network triggers the transmission of the set of SRS-Resources or SRS-PosResources using a configured aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger (L1 DCI).\n---\nAn additional list of DCI \"code points\" upon which the UE shall transmit SRS according to this SRS resource set configuration (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6). When the field is not included during a reconfiguration of SRS-ResourceSet of resourceType set to aperiodic, UE maintains this value based on the Need M; that is, this list is not considered as an extension of aperiodicSRS-Resource Trigger for purpose of applying the general rule for extended list in clause 6.1.3.",
