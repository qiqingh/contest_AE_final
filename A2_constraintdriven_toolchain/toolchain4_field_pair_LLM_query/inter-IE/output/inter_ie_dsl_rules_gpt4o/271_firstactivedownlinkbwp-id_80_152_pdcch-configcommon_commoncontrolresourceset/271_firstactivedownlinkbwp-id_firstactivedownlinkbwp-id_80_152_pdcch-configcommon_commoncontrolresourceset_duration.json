If a UE is provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP on the carrier of the secondary cell.",
