    "evidence": "For non-codebook based transmission, the UE can calculate the precoder used for the transmission of SRS based on measurement of an associated NZP CSI-RS resource. A UE can be configured with only one NZP CSI-RS resource for the SRS resource set with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' if configured. - If aperiodic SRS resource set is configured, the associated NZP-CSI-RS is indicated via SRS request field in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and \\( 1 \\_1 \\), as well as DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present) and DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present), where AperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger and AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList (indicating the association between aperiodic SRS triggering state(s) and SRS resource sets), triggered SRS resource(s) srs-ResourceSetId, csi-RS (indicating the associated NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId) are higher layer configured in SRS-ResourceSet. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and 1_1 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and the SRSResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and \\( 1 \\_2 \\) are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2. A UE is not expected to update the SRS precoding information if the gap from the last symbol of the reception of the aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS resource and the first symbol of the aperiodic SRS transmission is less than \\( 42 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) OFDM symbols, where the SCS configuration \\( \\mu \\) is the smallest SCS configuration between the NZP-CSI-RS resource and the SRS transmission.",
