Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP.

In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon. The network shall not use same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSetExt configured via SIB20 in this field.\n---\nAn additional common control resource set which may be configured and used for any common or UE-specific search space. If the network configures this field, it uses a ControlResourceSetld other than 0 for this ControlResourceSet. The network configures the commonControlResourceSet in SIB1 so that it is contained in the bandwidth of CORESET\\#0.\n---\nParameters of the common CORESET\\#0 which can be used in any common or UE-specific search spaces. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in M/B pdcch-ConfigS/B1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP\\#0) controlResourceSetZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10 are satisfied.\n---\nThe IE PDCCH-ConfigSIBI is used to configure CORESET\\#0 and search space\\#0.\n---\nAccounts for an overhead from CSI-RS, CORESET etc. If the field is absent, the UE applies value xOh0 (see TS 38.214 [19]).\n---\nAccounts for overhead from CSI-RS, CORESET, etc. If the field is absent, the UE applies value xOh0 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.3.2).\n---\nThe first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.\n---\nIndicates the TCI state for PDCCH for each configured CORESET of the DL BWP to be activated at SCell activation, to be activated for the PSCell at SCG activation and/or to be used for BFD, RLM and measurements while the SCG is deactivated. The list includes exactly as many entries as CORESETs configured in this BWP, ordered by increasing values of ControlResourceSet-ld, i.e. the first entry indicates the TCI state for the configured CORESET with the lowest ControlResourceset-/d value, the second value indicates the TCI states for the configured CORESET with the second lowest ControlResourceset-Id value, and so on.\n---\nThe UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.\n---\nIf a UE is provided two TCI states indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in a CORESET associated with a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, the UE may assume the quasi co-location information indicated in both of the two TCI states for the PDCCH reception in the CORESET.

For a CORESET with index 0 ,\n---\n- a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent random access procedure not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure, if no MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state for the CORESET is received after the most recent random access procedure, or a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19.  For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 , if a UE is provided a single TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one or two of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the one or more DL RS configured by the TCI states. For a CORESET with index 0 , the UE expects that a CSI-RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in a TCI state indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET is provided by a SS/PBCH block\n---\n- a bitmap by freqMonitorLocations, if provided, to indicate an index of one or more RB sets for the search space set \\( s \\), where the MSB \\( k \\) in the bitmap corresponds to RB set \\( k-1 \\) in the DL BWP. For RB set \\( k \\) indicated in the bitmap, the first \\( \\operatorname{PRB} \\) of the frequency domain monitoring location confined within the RB set is given by \\( R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu}+N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} \\), where \\( R B_{s 0+k, \\mathrm{DL}}^{\\text {start }, \\mu} \\) is the index of first common RB of the RB set \\( k \\) [6, TS 38.214], and \\( N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }} \\) is provided by \\( r b \\)-Offset or \\( N_{\\mathrm{RB}}^{\\text {offset }}=0 \\) if \\( r b \\)-Offset is not provided. For each RB set with a corresponding value of 1 in the bitmap, the frequency domain resource allocation pattern for the monitoring location is determined based on the first \\( N_{\\text {RBG }}^{\\text {size }} 0 \\) bits infrequencyDomainResources provided by the associated CORESET configuration.\n---\nFor a search space set \\( s \\) associated with CORESET \\( p \\), the CCE indexes for aggregation level \\( L \\) corresponding to PDCCH candidate \\( m_{s, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\) of the search space set in slot \\( n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu} \\) for an active DL BWP of a serving cell corresponding to carrier indicator field value \\( n_{C I} \\) are given by\n---\nFor search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \\( s_{j} \\) and \\( s_{i} \\), respectively, a UE monitors, in monitoring occasions with same index according to each of search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) in a slot, PDCCH candidates \\( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\) and \\( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\), with \\( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \\), for detection of a DCI format with same information. The UE expects \\( k_{s_{i}}= k_{s_{j}}, o_{s_{i}}=o_{s_{j}}, T_{s_{i}}=T_{s_{j}}, M_{s_{i}}^{(L)}=M_{s_{j}}^{(L)} \\), and a same number of non-overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions per slot based on corresponding monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot, for search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\). For CORESET \\( p_{i} \\) associated with the search space set \\( s_{i} \\) and for CORESET \\( p_{j} \\) associated with the search space set \\( s_{j} \\), the UE is provided tci-\n---\nIf the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 .\n---\nIf a UE is not provided peiSearchSpace for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2APDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If the UE is provided peiSearchSpace with zero value for the Type2A-PDCCH CSS set index, and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13.\n---\n- \\( P \\leq 5 \\) CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET\n---\n- \\( P \\leq 5 \\) CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET  For each CORESET, the UE is provided the following by ControlResourceSet:",
