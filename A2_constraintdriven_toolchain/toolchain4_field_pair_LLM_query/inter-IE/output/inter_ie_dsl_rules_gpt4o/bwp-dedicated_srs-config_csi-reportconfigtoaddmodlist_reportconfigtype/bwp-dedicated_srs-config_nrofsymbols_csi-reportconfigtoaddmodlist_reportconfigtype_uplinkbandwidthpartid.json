The configured CLI-RSSI resource does not exceed the slot boundary of the reference SCS. If the SCS of configured DL BWP(s) is larger than the reference SCS, network configures startPosition and nrofSymbols such that the configured CLI-RSSI resource not to exceed the slot boundary corresponding to the configured BWP SCS.
