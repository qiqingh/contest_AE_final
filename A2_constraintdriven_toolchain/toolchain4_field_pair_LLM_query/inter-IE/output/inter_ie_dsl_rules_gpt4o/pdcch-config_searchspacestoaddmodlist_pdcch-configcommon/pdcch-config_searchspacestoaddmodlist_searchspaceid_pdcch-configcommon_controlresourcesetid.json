For DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and the union of the indicated set of RB sets and intra-cell guard bands defined in Clause 7 between the indicated RB sets, if any. For DCI 00 monitored in a common search space, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and a single uplink RB set of the active UL BWP. For DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the lowest indexed one amongst uplink RB set(s) that intersects the lowest-indexed CCE of the PDCCH in which the UE detects the DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) in the active downlink BWP . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the uplink RB set of a PUSCH when scheduled by DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. If there is no intersection, the uplink RB set is RB set 0 in the active uplink BWP. For DCI \\( 0-0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the same one in which the UE transmits the PRACH associated with the RAR UL grant, in which case the UE assumes that the uplink RB set is defined as when the UE is not configured with intraCellGuardBandsUL-List (see Clause 7).\n---\nUpon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if \\( k_{S S B}<24 \\) [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if \\( k_{S S B}<12 \\) for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if \\( k_{S S B}>23 \\) for FR1 or if \\( k_{S S B}>11 \\) for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon.\n---\nIf the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH. If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, where the UE is provided two coresetPoollndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoollndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\), or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. The UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0} \\) to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), the UE expects the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include up to a number of \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\) RS indexes indicated by capabilityparametername. If the UE is not provided \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\), and if a number of active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs is larger than \\( N_{\\mathrm{BFD}} \\), the UE determines the set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs corresponding to search space sets according to an ascending order for monitoring periodicity. If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index.\n---\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, as described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE does not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld.\n---\n- the CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType \\( = \\) 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and\n---\nA UE is not required to monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0/0A/1/2-PDCCH CSS set when the active TCI state for a corresponding CORESET is not associated with physCellld in ServingCellConfigCommon.  If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.\n---\n- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that includes a CORESET with index 0 , as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block, or\n---\nThe UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.\n---\n- a search space set index \\( s, 0<s<40 \\), by searchSpaceld - an association between the search space set \\( s \\) and a CORESET \\( p \\) by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610\n---\n- an association between the search space set \\( s \\) and a CORESET \\( p \\) by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610\n---\n- a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the CORESET for PDCCH monitoring within each slot where the UE monitors PDCCH, by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot - a duration of \\( T_{s}<k_{s} \\) indicating a number of slots that the search space set \\( s \\) exists by duration, or a number of slots in consecutive groups of slots where the search space set \\( s \\) can exist by duration-r 17\n---\nA UE does not expect to be provided a first symbol and a number of consecutive symbols for a CORESET that results to a PDCCH candidate mapping to symbols of different slots.  A UE does not expect any two PDCCH monitoring occasions on an active DL BWP, for a same search space set or for different search space sets, in a same CORESET to be separated by a non-zero number of symbols that is smaller than the CORESET duration.\n---\nthe UE counts each PDCCH candidate for the one of the search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) that the UE monitors PDCCH in the later span, as two PDCCH candidates. The UE does not expect a first PDCCH candidate from search space set \\( s_{i} \\) or \\( s_{j} \\) and a second PDCCH candidate from a search space set \\( s_{k} \\) that does not include searchSpaceLinking to use a same set of CCEs and same scrambling in a same CORESET, and provide respective first and second DCI formats with same size, in any span other than the first span in a slot.\n---\n- has a PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level \\( L \\) in CORESET \\( p \\) associated with search space set \\( s_{i} \\) for detection of a first DCI format, other than DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) or DCI format \\( 1 \\_0 \\), having a first size and scheduling\n---\nFor the purpose of determining the CORESET, a first CSI-RS associated with a SS/PBCH block in a first cell and a second CSI-RS in a second cell that is also associated with the SS/PBCH block are assumed to have same QCL 'typeD' properties.  The allocation of non-overlapping CCEs and of PDCCH candidates for PDCCH monitoring is according to all search space sets associated with the multiple CORESETs on the active DL BWP(s) of the one or more cells.\n---\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE determines an offset from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block - according to the offset in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and\n---\nwhere the offsets are defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set that is same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH block.\n---\n\\caption{Table 13-11: Parameters for PDCCH monitoring occasions for Type0-PDCCH CSS set - SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1 and FR1} \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \\hline Index & 0 & Number of search space sets per slot & M & First symbol index \\\\\n---\nThis field may indicate that this cell does not provide S/B1 and that there is hence no CORESET\\#0 configured in M/B (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).",
