The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set.",
