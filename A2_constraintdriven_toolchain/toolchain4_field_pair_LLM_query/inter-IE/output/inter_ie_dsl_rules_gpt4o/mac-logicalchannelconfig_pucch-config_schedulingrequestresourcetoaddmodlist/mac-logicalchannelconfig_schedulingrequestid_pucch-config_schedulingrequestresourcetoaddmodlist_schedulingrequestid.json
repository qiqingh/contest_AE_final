The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining \\( m_{0} \\) as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting \\( m_{\\mathrm{cs}}=0 \\). For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting \\( b(0)=0 \\).\n---\nA symbol of a slot is equivalent to being configured as hard if an [AB-DU would transmit a SS/PBCH block, PDCCH for Type0-PDCCH CSS sets configured by pdcchConfigSIB1, or a periodic CSI-RS in the symbol of the slot, or would receive a PRACH or a SR in the symbol of the slot.",
