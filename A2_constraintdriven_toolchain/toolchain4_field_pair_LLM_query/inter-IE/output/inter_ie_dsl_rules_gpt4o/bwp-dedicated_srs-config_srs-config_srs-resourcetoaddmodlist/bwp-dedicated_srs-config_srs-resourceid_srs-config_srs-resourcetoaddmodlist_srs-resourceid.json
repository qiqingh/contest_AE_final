    "evidence": "When a spatialRelationInfo is activated/updated for a semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource by a MAC CE for a set of CCs/BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs provided by higher layer parameter simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 1 or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 2 is determined by the indicated CC in the MAC CE, the spatialRelationInfo is applied for the semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource(s) with the same SRS resource ID for all the BWPs in the determined CCs.\n---\n- SRS Resource ID: This field indicates the SP/AP SRS Resource ID identified by SRS-Resourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 6 bits;\n---\n- SRS resource ID: When \\( F_{1} \\) is set to 0 , the field indicates an index for SRS resource SRS-Resourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5]; When \\( F_{1} \\) is set to 1 , the field indicates an index for Positioning SRS resource SRS-PosResourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 5 bits representing the index from 0 to 31;\n---\n- E: This field indicates the extension of SRS resource ID as the MSB of SRS resource ID. The total length of the extended SRS resource ID is 6 bits. If \\( E \\) bit is set to 1 , the SRS resource ID value is 5 -bit SRS resource ID field +32 ;\n---\n- SRS Resource ID: This field indicates the SP/AP SRS Resource ID identified by SRS-Resourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 6 bits; - TCI State Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell on which the TCI State used for SRS Resource ID \\( { }_{1} \\) is located. The length of the field is 5 bits;\n---\n- [AB-MT beam type [D]: This field determines the type of information used as an indication of an uplink or downlink [AB-MT beam, indicated with the [AB-MT Resource set [Dr. If the value of the field is 00 , the information included in the [AB-MT Resource set [D, field is the TCI state ID (contained in the 7 rightmost bits of the field). If the value of the field is 01, the information included in the [AB-MT Resource set[D, field is the SSB ID (contained in the 6 rightmost bits of the field). If the value of the field is 10 , the information included in the [AB-MT Resource set [D, field is the CSI-RS index (comprising all 8 bits), which is the NZP-CSI-RSResourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If the value of the field is 11, the information included in the 6 rightmost bits in the [AB-MT Resource set [D, field is the SRS-ResourceID. The length of the field is 2 bits;\n---\n- Uplink TCI state ID or SRS Resource ID: This field is used to indicate the uplink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. If the dl-OrJointTCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and unifiedTCIStateType is configured with a value joint, this field contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits) of a Joint TCI State configured in the active DL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission. If the ul-TCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this field contains TCI-UL-State-Id (contained in the 6 rightmost bits) of an UL TCI State configured in the active UL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero. Otherwise, 6 rightmost bits of this field contain SRS-ResourceID configured in the active UL BWP which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero;\n---\n\\hline & RP-92 & RP-211474 & 2580 & 2 & F & Conrections on the UE capability of indication on supporting the extension of SRSresourceID & 16.5.0 \\\\",
