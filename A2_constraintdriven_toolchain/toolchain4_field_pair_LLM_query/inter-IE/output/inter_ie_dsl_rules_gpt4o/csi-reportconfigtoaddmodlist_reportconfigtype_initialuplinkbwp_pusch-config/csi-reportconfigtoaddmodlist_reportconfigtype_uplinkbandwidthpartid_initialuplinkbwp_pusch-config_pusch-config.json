    "evidence": "Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\), the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.\n---\nFor pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-rl7 in pusch-Config, each PUSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \\( K_{2} \\). The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 signalled in DCI format 0_1.  If a UE is configured with pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PUSCH on a UL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is indicated re-transmission of PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\), where the PUSCH is correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 by the DCI is more than one.\n---\nIf the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\). The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\nFor a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TCRNTI, frequency offsets are obtained as described in clause 8.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. Otherwise, for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 \\) or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 / 0 \\_1 \\) and for resource allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config. - When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.\n---\nFor a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config- - When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.\n---\nFor a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \\( b \\), as described in clause 12 , of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( c \\), a UE first calculates a linear value \\( \\hat{P}_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\) of the transmit power \\( P_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\), with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1. For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\), or configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, if txConfig in PUSCH-Config is set to 'codebook',\n---\nIf a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided pusch-Config for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.  If a UE transmits a PUSCH associated with a RS resource index \\( q_{d} \\), as described in clause 7.1.1, on active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( c \\) in slot \\( n \\) and provides a Type 1 power headroom report for an actual PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index \\( q_{d} \\), the Type 1 power headroom report is for the first PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index \\( q_{d} \\) that overlaps with slot \\( n \\).\n---\nA UE determines time resources and frequency resources for PUSCH occasions in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-Config for the active UL BWP. If the active UL BWP is not the initial UL BWP and msgA-PUSCH-Config is not provided for the active UL BWP, the UE uses the msgA-PUSCH-Config provided for the initial UL BWP.\n---\nPUSCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL and if it has a PUSCH-Config for both UL and SUL, an ULSUL indicator field in DCI indicates which of the two to use.
