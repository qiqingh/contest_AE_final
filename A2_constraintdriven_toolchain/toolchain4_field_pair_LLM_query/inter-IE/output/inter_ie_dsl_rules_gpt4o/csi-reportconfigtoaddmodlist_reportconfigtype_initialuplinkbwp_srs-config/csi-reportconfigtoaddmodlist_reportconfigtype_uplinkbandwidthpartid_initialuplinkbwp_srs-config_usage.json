    "evidence": "For non-codebook based transmission, the UE can calculate the precoder used for the transmission of SRS based on measurement of an associated NZP CSI-RS resource. A UE can be configured with only one NZP CSI-RS resource for the SRS resource set with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' if configured. - If aperiodic SRS resource set is configured, the associated NZP-CSI-RS is indicated via SRS request field in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and \\( 1 \\_1 \\), as well as DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present) and DCI format \\( 1 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present), where AperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger and AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList (indicating the association between aperiodic SRS triggering state(s) and SRS resource sets), triggered SRS resource(s) srs-ResourceSetId, csi-RS (indicating the associated NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId) are higher layer configured in SRS-ResourceSet. The SRS-ResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and 1_1 are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList and the SRSResourceSet(s) associated with the SRS request by DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) and \\( 1 \\_2 \\) are defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2. A UE is not expected to update the SRS precoding information if the gap from the last symbol of the reception of the aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS resource and the first symbol of the aperiodic SRS transmission is less than \\( 42 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) OFDM symbols, where the SCS configuration \\( \\mu \\) is the smallest SCS configuration between the NZP-CSI-RS resource and the SRS transmission. - If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, the presence of the associated CSI-RS is indicated by the SRS request field if the value of the SRS request field is not ' 00 ' as in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of [5, TS 38.212] and if the scheduling DCI is not used for cross carrier or cross bandwidth part scheduling. If UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in the active DL BWP and the currently applicable minimum scheduling offset restriction \\( K_{0, m i n} \\) is larger than 0 , the UE does not expected to receive the scheduling DCI with the SRS request field value other than ' 00 '. The CSI-RS is located in the same slot as the SRS request field. If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, any of the TCI states configured in the scheduled CC shall not be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1 _ 1 if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_1 \\), the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' value ' 0 '. When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be scheduled with a DCI in slot \\( n \\) to transmit a PUSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI with \\( K_{2} \\) smaller than \\( \\left\\lceil K_{2 \\text { min }} \\cdot \\frac{2^{\\mu}}{2^{\\mu}}\\right\\rceil \\), where \\( K_{2 \\text { mn }} \\) and \\( \\mu \\) are the applied minimum scheduling offset restriction and the numerology of the active UL BWP of the scheduled cell when receiving the DCI in slot \\( n \\), respectively, and \\( \\mu^{\\prime} \\) is the numerology of the new active UL BWP in case of active UL BWP change in the scheduled cell and is equal to \\( \\mu \\), otherwise. The minimum scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PUSCH transmission is scheduled by RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant for RACH procedure, or when PUSCH is scheduled with TC-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1.  When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', for PUSCH repetition Type A, in case \\( K>1 \\), the same symbol allocation is applied across the \\( K \\) consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall repeat the TB across the \\( K \\) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, and the association of the first and second SRS resource set in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 to each slot is determined as follows:\n---\nDCI format 0_1 for a given resource allocation type indicated by resourceAllocation, except if uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, in which case uplink type 2 resource allocation is used wherein the UE interprets the LSB bits in the higher layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation as for the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI 0_1 according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.2.2.3; - The \\( I_{M C S} \\) is provided by higher layer parameter mcsAndTBS; - Number of DM-RS CDM groups, DM-RS ports, SRS resource indication and DM-RS sequence initialization are determined as in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], and the antenna port value, the bit value for DM-RS sequence initialization, precoding information and number of layers, SRS resource indicator are provided by antennaPort, dmrs-SeqInitialization, precodingAndNumberOfLayers, and srs-ResourceIndicator respectively; When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2, precoding information and number of layers (applicable when higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook') associated with the first and second SRS resource set is provided by precodingAndNumberOfLayers and precodingAndNumberOfLayers2, respectively, and SRS resource indicators associated with the first and second SRS resource sets are provided by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2, respectively. When both srsResourceSetToAddModList and srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 are configured with two SRS resource sets, the two SRS resource sets configured by srs-ResourceSetToAddModList is used to determine the SRS resource indications by srs-ResourceIndicator and srs-ResourceIndicator2.\n---\nThe UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with \\( K \\geq 1 \\) SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with \\( K \\geq 1 \\) SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.\n---\n- when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot \\( n \\), the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame } \\mu} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set.\n---\nWhen the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS is set 'enabled', and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo for the SRS resource, except for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'beamManagement' or for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' with configuration of associatedCSI-RS or for the SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, is not configured in FR2 and if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter(s) pathlossReferenceRS, and if the UE is not configured with different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSets, and is not provided at least one TCI codepoint mapped with two TCI states, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource in an active UL BWP of a CC,\n---\nFor a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \\( b \\), as described in clause 12 , of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( c \\), a UE first calculates a linear value \\( \\hat{P}_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\) of the transmit power \\( P_{\\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\), with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1. For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\), or configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, if txConfig in PUSCH-Config is set to 'codebook', - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is provided, the UE scales \\( \\hat{P}_{\\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\\right) \\) by \\( s \\) where: - if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerModel, and each SRS resource in the SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, \\( s \\) is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource\n---\n- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and is provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SRS resource set indicator field, and for active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell\n---\n- For \\( j \\in\\{2, \\ldots, J-1\\}=S_{J} \\), a \\( P_{0 \\_ \\text {NOMINAL }, \\text { PUSCH }, f_{, c}}(j) \\) value, applicable for all \\( j \\in S_{J} \\), is provided by \\( p 0 \\) provided, for each carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( c \\) and a set of \\( P_{0 \\_ \\text {UE } \\_ \\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \\) values are provided by a set of \\( p 0 \\) in P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet indicated by a respective set of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld for active UL BWP \\( b \\) of carrier \\( f \\) of serving cell \\( c \\) - If the UE is provided by SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl more than one values of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld and if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes an SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for the SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by \\( p 0 \\)-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values and determines the value of \\( P_{0} \\) ue_pusch, \\( b, f, c \\) ( \\( j \\) ) from the \\( p 0-P U S C H \\) AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the SRI field value.
