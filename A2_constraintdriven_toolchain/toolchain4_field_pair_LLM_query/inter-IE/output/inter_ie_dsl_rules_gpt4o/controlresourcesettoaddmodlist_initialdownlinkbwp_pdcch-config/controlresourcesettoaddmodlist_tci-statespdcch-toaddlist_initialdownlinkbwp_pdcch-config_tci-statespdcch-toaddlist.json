If the field of CORESET ID is set to 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld for a TCI state of the first 64 TCI-states configured by tci-StatesToAddModList and tciStatesToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or by dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToAddModList and dl-OrJoint-TCI-State-ToReleaseList in the PDSCH-Config in the active BWP or the reference BWP.

If the field of CORESET ID is set to the other value than 0 , this field indicates a TCI-Stateld configured by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList in the controlResourceSet identified by the indicated CORESET ID. The length of the field is 7 bits.\n---\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR, a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot \\( n \\) and according to antenna port quasi colocation parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot \\( n+4+2^{\\mu} \\cdot k_{\\text {mac }} \\), where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission and \\( k_{\\text {mac }} \\) is a number of slots provided by \\( K-M a c[12, T S 38.331] \\) or \\( k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 \\) if \\( K-M a c \\) is not provided, within a window configured by BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld and for corresponding PDSCH reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList. After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.\n---\n- if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET, or has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI states for the CORESET by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure, or for a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19 for a same HARQ process;",
