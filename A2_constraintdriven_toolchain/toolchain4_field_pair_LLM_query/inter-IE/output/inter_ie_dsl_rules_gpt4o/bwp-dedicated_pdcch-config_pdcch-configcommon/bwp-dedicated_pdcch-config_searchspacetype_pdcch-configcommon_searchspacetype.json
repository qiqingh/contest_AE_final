For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used.

If a CSI-RS resource is referred \\( N \\) times by one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted \\( N \\) times.

After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.  For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of a first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld for which the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and until the UE receives an activation command for PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo [11, TS 38.321] or is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo for PUCCH resource(s), the UE transmits a PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using\n---\nIf a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower.

If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB .

If \\( N \\geq 1 \\), all consecutive \\( N \\) SS/PBCH block indexes are associated with one PRACH occasion.  SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon are mapped to valid PRACH occasions in the following order where the parameters are described in [4, TS 38.211].\n---\nFor a PRACH transmission by a UE triggered by a PDCCH order, the PRACH mask index field [5, TS 38.212], if the value of the random access preamble index field is not zero, indicates the PRACH occasion for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the SS/PBCH block index indicated by the SS/PBCH block index field of the PDCCH order. If the UE is provided \\( K_{\\text {cell, offset }} \\) by CellSpecific_Koffset, the PRACH occasion is after slot \\( n+2^{\\mu} \\cdot K_{\\text {cell, offset }} \\) where \\( n \\) is the slot of the UL BWP for the PRACH transmission that overlaps with the end of the PDCCH order reception assuming \\( T_{\\mathrm{TA}}=0 \\), and \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission. If the PDCCH reception for the PDCCH order includes two PDCCH candidates from two linked search space sets based on searchSpaceLinking, as described in clause 10.1, the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is the last symbol of the PDCCH candidate that ends later. The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10,11.1, and 11.1.1.

The PRACH occasions are mapped consecutively per corresponding SS/PBCH block index. The indexing of the PRACH occasion indicated by the mask index value is reset per mapping cycle of consecutive PRACH occasions per SS/PBCH block index.
