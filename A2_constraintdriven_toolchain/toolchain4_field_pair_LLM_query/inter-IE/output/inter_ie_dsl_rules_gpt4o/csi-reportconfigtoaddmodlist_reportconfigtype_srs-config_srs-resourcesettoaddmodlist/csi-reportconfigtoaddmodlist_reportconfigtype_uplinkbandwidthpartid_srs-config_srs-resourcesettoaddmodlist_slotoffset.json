The time domain behavior of the CSI-ReportConfig is indicated by the higher layer parameter reportConfigType and can be set to 'aperiodic', 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH', 'semiPersistentOnPUSCH', or 'periodic'. For 'periodic' and 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH/'semiPersistentOnPUSCH' CSI reporting, the configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The higher layer parameter reportQuantity indicates the CSI-related, L1-RSRP-related, L1-SINR-related or Capability[Set][ndex-related quantities to report. The reportFreqConfiguration indicates the reporting granularity in the frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI reporting is wideband or sub-band. The timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements parameter in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel measurements and timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements can be configured to enable time domain restriction for interference measurements. The CSI-ReportConfig can also contain CodebookConfig, which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II, Enhanced Type II CSI, or Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection including codebook subset restriction when applicable, and configurations of group-based reporting.\n---\nEach CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S \\( \\geq 1 \\) CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP.  The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is \\( S=2 \\), otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to \\( S=1 \\). For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.\n---\nWhen aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic reporting, the CSI-RS offset is configured per resource set by the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset or aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16.

Otherwise, change of applied minimum scheduling offset restriction indication carried by DCI in slot \\( n \\), shall be applied in slot \\( n+X \\) of the scheduling cell. The UE does not expect to be scheduled with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 1 \\_1 \\) with 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field indicating another change to \\( K_{0 \\mathrm{~min}} \\) or \\( K_{2 \\mathrm{~min}} \\) for the same active BWP of the scheduled cell before slot \\( n+X \\) of the scheduling cell.\n---\n- \\( N_{\\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} \\) and \\( \\mu_{\\text {off set, PDCCH }} \\) are the \\( N_{\\text {slot, offset }}^{\\mathrm{CA}} \\) and the \\( \\mu_{\\text {offset }} \\), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \\( N_{\\text {slot, offset, SRS }}^{C A} \\) and \\( \\mu_{\\text {offset, SRS }} \\) are the \\( N_{\\text {slot,offsel }}^{C A} \\) and the \\( \\mu_{\\text {offset }} \\), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5. - if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing' or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, or of the latest reference aperiodic CSI-RS. If the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS or of the reference aperiodic SRS.
