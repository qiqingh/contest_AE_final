If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI.

Upon detection of a DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.\n---\nThe UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is determined according to clause 8.3 of [6,38.213] or a MsgA PUSCH transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined according to clause 8.1A of [6,38.213]. Three uplink resource allocation schemes type 0 , type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type 1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform precoding is enabled or disabled.  If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\). The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\nIf the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\). The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured, uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.\n---\nThe UE expects that either none or both of uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured.  If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active bandwidth part change via DCI, the RB indexing for uplink type 0 , type 1 and type 2 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active bandwidh part change via DCI, the RB indexing for uplink type 0 , type 1 , type 2 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the uplink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part. RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined uplink bandwidth part.\n---\n6.1.2.2.2 Uplink resource allocation type 1  In uplink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated non-interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part of size \\( N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} \\) PRBs except for the case when DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) is decoded in any common search space in which case the size of the initial UL bandwidth part \\( N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, 0}^{\\mathrm{azz}} \\) shall be used.\n---\nIn uplink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated non-interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part of size \\( N_{\\text {BWP }}^{\\text {size }} \\) PRBs except for the case when DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) is decoded in any common search space in which case the size of the initial UL bandwidth part \\( N_{\\mathrm{BWP}, 0}^{\\mathrm{azz}} \\) shall be used.\n---\n6.1.2.2.3 Uplink resource allocation type 2  In uplink resource allocation of type 2, the resource block assignment information defined in [5, TS 38.212] indicates to a UE a set of up to \\( M \\) interlace indices, and for DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1 a set of up to \\( N_{\\text {RB-set, UL }}^{\\mathrm{BWP}} \\) contiguous RB sets, where \\( M \\) and interlace indexing are defined in Clause 4.4.4.6 in [4, TS 38.211].\n---\nIn uplink resource allocation of type 2, the resource block assignment information defined in [5, TS 38.212] indicates to a UE a set of up to \\( M \\) interlace indices, and for DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1 a set of up to \\( N_{\\text {RB-set, UL }}^{\\mathrm{BWP}} \\) contiguous RB sets, where \\( M \\) and interlace indexing are defined in Clause 4.4.4.6 in [4, TS 38.211].\n---\nFor DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DC \\( 0 \\_1 \\) for both \\( \\mu=0 \\) and \\( \\mu=1 \\), the \\( Y= \\left\\lceil\\log _{2} \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{RB}-\\mathrm{set}, \\mathrm{UL}}^{\\mathrm{BWP}}\\left(N_{\\mathrm{RB}-\\mathrm{set}, \\mathrm{UL}}^{\\mathrm{BWP}}+1\\right)}{2}\\right\\rceil \\) LSBs of the resource block assignment information indicate to a UE a set of contiguously allocated RB sets for PUSCH scheduled by DCI \\( 0 \\_0 \\) monitored in a UE-specific search space, DCI \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and Type 1 and Type 2 configured grant. The resource allocation field consists of a resource indication value ( \\( R I V_{\\text {RB-set }} \\) ).
