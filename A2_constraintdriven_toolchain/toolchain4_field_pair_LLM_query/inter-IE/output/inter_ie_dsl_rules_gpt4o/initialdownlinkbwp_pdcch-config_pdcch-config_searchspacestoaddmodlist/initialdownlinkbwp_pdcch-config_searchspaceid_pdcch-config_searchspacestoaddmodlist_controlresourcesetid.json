If the GSCN range is \\( \\left[N_{\\mathrm{GSCN}}^{\\mathrm{Reference}}, N_{\\mathrm{GSCN}}^{\\mathrm{Reference}}\\right] \\), the UE determines that there is no information for a second SS/PBCH block with a CORESET for an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the detected SS/PBCH block.  If a UE does not detect any SS/PBCH block providing a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 4.1, within a time period determined by the UE, the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN of SS/PBCH locations in performing cell search.\n---\nFor an initial DL BWP provided by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, if a UE monitors PDCCH according to a Type1-PDCCH CSS set and does not monitor PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE assumes that the initial DL BWP does not include SS/PBCH blocks or the CORESET with index 0 . If the UE monitors PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE assumes that the initial DL BWP\n---\n- includes a SS/PBCH block and does not include the CORESET with index 0 if the initial DL BWP does not include the SS/PBCH block the UE used to obtain SIB1  For an active DL BWP provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated, a UE assumes that the active DL BWP includes a SS/PBCH block, unless the UE indicates a capability to operate in the DL BWP without receiving an SS/PBCH block, and does not include the CORESET with index 0 .\n---\n- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI;\n---\n- if the PDSCH duration \\( l_{\\mathrm{d}} \\in\\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\\} \\) OFDM symbols for normal cyclic prefix or \\( l_{\\mathrm{d}} \\in \\{2,4,6\\} \\) OFDM symbols for extended cyclic prefix, and the front-loaded DM-RS of the PDSCH allocation collides with resources reserved for a search space set associated with a CORESET, \\( \\bar{l} \\) shall be incremented such that the first DM-RS symbol occurs immediately after the CORESET and until no collision with any CORESET occurs, and\n---\nFor PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .\n---\nFor PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,1 \\_2 \\), when a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and sfnSchemePdsch is not configured, and there is no TCI codepoint with two TCI states in the activation command, and if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal or larger than the threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable and the CORESET which schedules the PDSCH is indicated with two TCI states, the UE assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the first TCI state or QCL assumption which is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell.  If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\), and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\). When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL.",
