At least for RSSI measurement confined within the active DL BWP, the UE performs RSSI measurement using the numerology of the active DL BWP during the derived measurement duration. Otherwise, the numerology used by the UE for measurements is up to UE implementation. If configured, the UE performs RSSI measurements on a bandwidth in accordance with the received \\( r m t c \\)-Bandwidth.\n---\nIf \\( \\operatorname{smtc} 2 \\) is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in smtc2 in the same MeasObjectNR, the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc 2 configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtcl configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the above condition.\n---\nIf \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) in the same frequency (for intra frequency cell reselection) or different frequency (for inter frequency cell reselection), the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc2-LP configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtc configuration for that frequency. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell or serving cell (for cell reselection) meeting the above condition.  If smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtcl to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.\n---\nThis parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to \\( n \\)-th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The firstfleftmost bit corresponds to SS block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS block index 1 , and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the IAB-MT measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.\n---\nThe SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssbperiodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.\n---\nIndicates the minimum duration (in unit of symbols) from the ending symbol of the PUSCH to the starting symbol of the PDCCH containing the downlink feedback indication (DFI) carrying HARQ-ACK for this PUSCH. The HARQ-ACK received before this minimum duration is not considered as valid for this PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.5). The following minimum duration values are supported, depending on the configured subcarrier spacing [symbols]: \\\\\n---\nIndicates the duration for performing idle/inactive measurements while in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. Value sec10 correspond to 10 seconds, value sec30 to 30 seconds and so on.\n---\nThe UE can be configured to be indicated by DCI a value of X (i.e., skipping duration), in units of slots, among at most 3 multiple RRC configured values by scheduling DCIs indicating PDCCH schedules data. For each skipping duration (i.e. the value range of IE PDCCH-SkippingDuration-r17), \\( \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 20,30,40,50,60,80,100\\} \\) are valid for the 15 kHz SCS, \\( \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 40,60,80,100,120,160,200\\} \\) are valid for 30 kHz SCS, \\( \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 80,120,160,200,240,320,400\\} \\) are valid for 60 kHz SCS, and \\( \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 160,240 \\), \\( 320,400,480,640,800\\} \\) are valid for 120 kHz SCS,\\( \\{4,8,12, \\ldots, 640,960,1280,1600,1920,2560,3200\\} \\) are valid for 480 kHz SCS, and \\( \\{8,16,24, \\ldots, 1280,1920,2560,3200,3840 \\), 5120,6400 ) are valid for 960 kHz SCS.\n---\nFor DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 1 symbol. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10. For IAB-MT: For DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) or DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\), the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/dindicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSet/d indicates 1 symbol.\n---\nBitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the k -th bit is set to 1 , the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the SMTC measurement duration with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to \\( \\mathrm{k}-1 \\) may be transmitted; if the kt -th bit is set to 0 , the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k -th bit is set to 0 , where \\( \\mathrm{k}> \\) ssb-PositionQCL-Common and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. If ssb-PositionQCL is configured with a value smaller than ssb-PositionQCL-Common, only the leftmost K bits ( \\( \\mathrm{K}=s s b \\)-PositionQCL) are applicable for the corresponding cell.\n---\nConfigures the duration of the reference time region in symbols where a detected UL CI is applicable of this serving cell (servingCellId) (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A). If the field is absent, i.e., the configured UL CI monitoring periodicity indicated by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset for DCI format 2_4 is larger than 1 slot or 1 slot with only one monitoring occasion, the UE applies the value of the configured UL CI monitoring periodicity,\n---\nmaxPUSCH-Duration \\\\ If present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be transmitted using uplink grants that result in a PUSCH duration shorter than or equal to the duration indicated by this field. Otherwise, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be transmitted using an uplink grant resulting in any PUSCH duration. Corresponds to \"maxPUSCHDuration\" in TS 38.321 [3]. The PUSCH duration is calculated based on the same length of all symbols, and the shortest length applies if the symbol lengths are different.\n---\nThe duration for evaluating criteria to enter mobility states. Corresponds to \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{cRmax}} \\) in TS 38.304 [20]. Value in seconds, s 30 corresponds to 30 s and so on.\n---\nThe additional duration for evaluating criteria to enter normal mobility state. Corresponds to \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{CRmaxHyst}} \\) in TS 38.304 [20]. Value in seconds, value s 30 corresponds to 30 seconds and so on.\n---\nIndicates the slots in which the UE can perform RSSI measurements. The length of the BIT STRING is equal to the number of slots in the configured SMTC window (determined by the duration and by the subcarrierSpacing). The first (left-most / most significant) bit in the bitmap corresponds to the first slot in the SMTC window, the second bit in the bitmap corresponds to the second slot in the SMTC window, and so on. The UE measures in slots for which the corresponding bit in the bitmap is set to 1. In case this field is configured for a SCell with ca-SlotOffset-r16, the bits in the bitmap corresponds to the slots that are fully contained in the SMTC window.\n---\nIndicates 2Tx-2Tx switching mode is configured for inter-band UL CA or SUL, in which the switching gap duration for a triggered uplink switching (as specified in TS 38.214 [19]) is equal to the switching time capability value reported for the switching mode.\n---\nThe SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and NR PCell change. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon. \\\\\n---\nConfigures the length of a nominal time domain window in slots for DMRS bundling for PUCCH. The value shall not exceed the maximum duration defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39]. If this field is absent, the UE shall apply the default value that is the minimum value in the unit of consecutive slots of the time duration for the transmission of all PUCCH repetitions and the maximum duration defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].\n---\nConfigures the length of a nominal time domain window in number of consecutive slots for DMRS bundling for PUSCH. The value shall not exceed the maximum duration defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39]. For PUSCH repetition type A/B, if this field is absent, the UE shall apply the default value that is the minimum value in the unit of consecutive slots of the time duration for the transmission of all PUSCH repetitions and the maximum duration defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39]. For TBoMS, if this field is absent, the UE shall apply the default value that is the minimum value in the unit of consecutive slots of the duration of TBoMS transmission (including repetition of TBoMS) and the maximum duration defined in in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].\n---\nIf set to true, the UE limits CSI reports to the on-duration period of the DRX cycle, see TS 38.321 [3].\n---\nThe set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent in VarMeas/dieConfig, the UE measures on all SSblocks.\n---\nThis field specifies the offset in units of slots between two repeated instances of a DL-PRS Resource corresponding to the same DL-PRS Resource ID within a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. The time duration spanned by one DL-PRS Resource Set containing repeated DL-PRS Resources should not exceed the periodicity configured by periodicityAndOffset. The field is mandatory present, if repetitionFactor is present. Otherwise, it is not present.\n---\nA validity duration configured by the network for uplink synchronization assistance information (i.e. Serving satellite ephemeris and Common TA parameters) which indicates the maximum time during which the UE can apply assistance information without having acquired new assistance information. \\\\\n---\nNumber of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\). The UE ignores this field for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\). The maximum valid duration is periodicity- 1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).\n---\nThe first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.\n---\nIndicates the number of symbols from the beginning of the even indexed radio frame to the start of the first period within that radio frame that the UE can initiate a channel occupancy (see TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.3), based on the smallest SCS among the configured SCSs in the serving cell. The offset duration indicated by this field is less than the period duration indicated by periodUE. The maximum value is 279,559 and 1119 for 15,30 and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing, respectively.\n---\nThe duration in ms after which the UE falls back to the default Bandwidth Part (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15). When the network releases the timer configuration, the UE stops the timer without switching to the default BWP.\n---\nThe Network configures at most single non-zero offset duration in ms (independent on SCS) among CCs in the unaligned CA configuration. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value of 0 . The slot offset value can only be changed with SCell release and add.\n---\nA list of CO-DurationPerCell objects. If not configured, the UE uses the slot format indicator (SFI), if available, to determine the channel occupancy duration (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.1).\n---\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, and when the higher layer parameter ueSemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is not configured, where a UE is performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM symbols on all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension \\( T_{\\text {ext }} \\) to be applied for transmission according to [4, TS 38.211] where the index for \\( \\Delta_{i} \\) [4, TS 38.211] is chosen randomly from a set of values configured by higher layers according to the following rule:\n---\nThe UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the transmission of \\( K \\) repetitions larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity \\( P \\). If the UE determines that, for a transmission occasion, the number of symbols available for the PUSCH transmission in a slot is smaller than transmission duration \\( L \\), the UE does not transmit the PUSCH in the transmission occasion.\n---\nFor any RV sequence, the repetitions shall be terminated after transmitting K nominal repetitions, or at the last transmission occasion among the \\( K \\) nominal repetitions within the period \\( P \\), or from the starting symbol of an actual repetition that overlaps with a PUSCH with the same HARQ process scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), whichever is reached first.

The pair of reserved resources are respectively indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter resourceBlocks given by RateMatchPattern) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters symbolsInResourceBlock given by RateMatchPattern) for which the reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for PDSCH . For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by RateMatchPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair is present in the unit.

NZP CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. When the PDCCH candidates are associated with a search space set configured with searchSpaceLinking, for the purpose of determining the NZP CSI-RS resource active duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time among the two linked PDCCH candidates is used. For semi-persistent CSI-RS, starting from the end of when the activation command is applied, and ending at the end of when the deactivation command is applied. For periodic CSI-RS, starting when the periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layer signalling, and ending when the periodic CSI-RS configuration is released. If a CSI-RS resource is referred \\( N \\) times by one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted \\( N \\) times.

The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PUSCH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Typel-PDCCH CSS set. If \\( N_{\\mathrm{TA}, \\mathrm{adj}}^{\\mathrm{UE}} \\) or \\( N_{\\mathrm{TA}, \\mathrm{adj}}^{\\text {commnon }} \\), as defined in [4, TS 38.211], is not zero, the window starts after an additional \\( T_{\\mathrm{TA}}+k_{\\mathrm{mac}} \\) msec where \\( T_{\\mathrm{TA}} \\) is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and \\( k_{\\mathrm{mac}} \\) is provided by \\( K \\)-Mac or \\( k_{\\mathrm{mac}}=0 \\) if \\( K \\)-Mac is not provided.

If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \\( N_{\\mathrm{T}, 1}+0.75 \\mathrm{msec} \\) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \\( N_{\\mathrm{T}, 1} \\) is a time duration of \\( N_{1} \\) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For \\( \\mu=0 \\), the UE assumes \\( N_{1,0}= \\) 14 [6, TS 38.214].\n---\nThe UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH in a serving cell scheduled by a PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and one or multiple PDSCH(s) required to be received according to this Clause in the same serving cell without a corresponding PDCCH transmission if the PDSCHs partially or fully overlap in time except if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH ends at least \\( 14 \\cdot 2^{\\max (0, \\mu-3)} \\) symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, where \\( \\mu \\) and the symbol duration are based on the smallest numerology between the scheduling PDCCH and the PDSCH, in which case the UE shall decode the PDSCH scheduled by the PDCCH.
