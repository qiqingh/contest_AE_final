For 'periodic' and 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH/'semiPersistentOnPUSCH' CSI reporting, the configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The higher layer parameter reportQuantity indicates the CSI-related, L1-RSRP-related, L1-SINR-related or Capability[Set][ndex-related quantities to report. The reportFreqConfiguration indicates the reporting granularity in the frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI reporting is wideband or sub-band. The timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements parameter in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel measurements and timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements can be configured to enable time domain restriction for interference measurements. The CSI-ReportConfig can also contain CodebookConfig, which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II, Enhanced Type II CSI, or Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection including codebook subset restriction when applicable, and configurations of group-based reporting.\n---\nFor CSI-RS resource sets associated with Resource Settings configured with the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', 'periodic', or 'semi-persistent', trigger states for Reporting Setting(s) (configured with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'aperiodic') and/or Resource Setting for channel and/or interference measurement on one or more component carriers are configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList. For aperiodic CSI report triggering, a single set of CSI triggering states are higher layer configured, wherein the CSI triggering states can be associated with any candidate DL BWP. A UE is not expected to receive more than one DCI with non-zero CSI request field per slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive DCI with non-zero CSI request field within a cell group in a slot overlapping with any slot receiving DCI with non-zero CSI request field in the same cell group. A UE is not expected to be configured with different TCI-Stateld's for the same aperiodic CSI-RS resource ID configured in multiple aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets with the same triggering offset in the same aperiodic trigger state. A UE is not expected to receive more than one aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a given slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveB WP the UE is not expected to be triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP. Otherwise, when a UE is triggered with a CSI report for a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the most recent occasion, no later than the CSI reference resource, of the associated NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected to report the CSI for the non-active DL BWP and the CSI report associated with that BWP is omitted. When a UE is triggered with aperiodic NZP CSI-RS in a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to receive the NZP CSIRS, the UE is not expected to measure the aperiodic CSI-RS. In the carrier of the serving cell expecting to receive that associated NZP CSI-RS, if the active DL BWP when receiving the NZP CSI-RS is different from the active DL BWP when receiving the triggering DCI ,\n---\nFor semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }}, \\mu \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.\n---\nWhen DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and \\( N \\) Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.
