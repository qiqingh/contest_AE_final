    "evidence": "When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP.\n---\nPUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell.  The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, corresponding to the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell, as described in Clause 9.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213]. If the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell corresponds to two spatial relations, the UE shall transmit the PUSCH according to the spatial relation with the lower ID.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is not configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, snischemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption.  For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPLFor PUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP where all the PUCCH resource(s) are not configured with any spatial relation and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell in case CORESET(s) are configured on the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, sfnSchemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption.\n---\nTwo transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig in pusch-Config is set to 'codebook', the UE is configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter txConfig is set to 'nonCodebook'. If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\), the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.\n---\nWhen the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4, each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP.  If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended.\n---\nFor PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) on a cell and if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPLFor PUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE is configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP where all the PUCCH resource(s) are not configured with any spatial relation and the UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell in case CORESET(s) are configured on the cell. If the CORESET is indicated with two TCI states, sfnSchemePdcch is configured and the UE supports [DefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH-SfnPdcch], the UE shall use the first TCI state as the QCL assumption.\n---\n\\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and \\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:\n---\n\\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of another configured uplink grant which was not already deprioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and \\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI \\( =1 \\) or CRNTI which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than or equal to the priority of the uplink grant; and \\( 2> \\) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:\n---\nThe MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured.\n---\nOnly PUCCH resources on a BWP which is active at the time of SR transmission occasion are considered valid. As long as at least one SR is pending, the MAC entity shall for each pending SR: \\( 1> \\) if the MAC entity has no valid PUCCH resource configured for the pending SR; and\n---\n3> if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or, in current symbol n, if drxonDurationTimerPTM(s) of all multicast DRXes corresponding to the DRX group would not be running considering DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions corresponding to the DRX group are configured with multicast DRX: \\( 4> \\) not report CSI on PUCCH in this DRX group. NOTE 4: If a UE multiplexes a CSI configured on PUCCH with other overlapping UCI(s) according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] clause 9.2.5 and this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s) would be reported on a PUCCH resource either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured or outside the on-duration period of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other \\( \\mathrm{UCl}(\\mathrm{s}) \\).\n---\nIn addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or SLDRX Command indication. The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\n- BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9].
