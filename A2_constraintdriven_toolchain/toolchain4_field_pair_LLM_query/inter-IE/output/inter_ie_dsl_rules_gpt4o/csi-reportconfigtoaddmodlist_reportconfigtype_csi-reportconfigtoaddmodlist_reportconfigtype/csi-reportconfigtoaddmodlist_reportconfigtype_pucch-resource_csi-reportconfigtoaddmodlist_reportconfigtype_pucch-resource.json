If the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP of the cell corresponds to two spatial relations, the UE shall transmit the PUSCH according to the spatial relation with the lower ID.\n---\nIf a UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in a PUCCH-Config, the first symbol of a PUCCH resource provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet or SPS-PUCCH-AN-List in PUCCH-Config or by \\( n I P U C C H \\)-AN in SPS-Config for multiplexing HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH transmission is relative to the first symbol of the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining cases, the first symbol of a PUCCH resource is relative to the first symbol of a slot with \\( N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} \\) symbols [4, TS 38.211].  A UE can be configured up to four sets of PUCCH resources in a PUCCH-Config.

The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4.
