    "evidence": "If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'none' and if the CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) contains a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet that is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition and without the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE can only be configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer parameter nrofPorts for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block.\n---\n- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements.\n---\n- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation.\n---\n- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource setting is given by resourcesForChannelMeasurement for L1-RSRP measurement. In such a case, the number of configured CSI Resource Sets in the Resource Setting is \\( \\mathrm{S}=2 \\)\n---\n- When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation.\n---\n- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.  A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.\n---\n- if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, \\( r \\) ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank \\( r \\) and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence \\( p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \\ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \\ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} \\) of port indices, where \\( p_{0}^{(v)}, \\ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} \\) are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank \\( v \\) and \\( R \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, P\\} \\) where \\( P \\in\\{1,2,4,8\\} \\) is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks.\n---\n- If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, \\( M+N \\) resources are configured in the corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet. The \\( M \\) resources for channel measurement defined above are resource-wise associated with the first \\( M \\) CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources in the corresponding Resource Set. The \\( N \\) Resource Pairs for channel measurement are associated to the last \\( N \\) CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS Resource Pairs and CSI-IM resources in the CSI-IM Resource Set. The UE may assume that the two CSI-RS resources for channel measurement in a Resource Pair and the associated CSI-IM resource for interference measurement are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'.\n---\n- powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of \\( [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} \\) with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of \\( [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} \\) with 1 dB step size.\n---\nCSI-SSB-ResourceSet for channel measurements. Entry number in csi-SSB-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).\n---\nList of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS. Each TCI-Stateld refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resourcesForChannelMeasurement (in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above) belong to. First entry in qc/-info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of that NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qclinfo corresponds to second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.1). When this field is absent for aperiodic CSIRS, the UE shall use QCL information included in the \"indicated\" DL only/Joint TCI state as specified in TS 38.214\n---\nNZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurements. Entry number in nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).\n---\nNZP CSI RS resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfig/d of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field \"carrier\" above.
