If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.\n---\nFor the PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI \\( =1 \\), the parameters in pusch-Config are applied for the PUSCH transmission except for p0-NominalWithoutGrant, p0-PUSCH-Alpha, powerControlLoopToUse, pathlossReferenceIndex described in clause 7.1 of [6, TS 38.213], mcs-Table, mcsTableTransformPrecoder described in clause 6.1.4.1 and transformPrecoder described in clause 6.1.3.\n---\nTwo transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission and non-codebook based transmission.

If the higher layer parameter txConfig is not configured, the UE is not expected to be scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\), the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. Except if the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0 is set 'enabled', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.\n---\nFor codebook based transmission, the UE determines its codebook subsets based on TPMI(s) and upon the reception of higher layer parameter codebookSubset in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) and codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH associated with DCI format 02 which may be configured with 'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent', or 'partialAndNonCoherent', or 'nonCoherent' depending on the UE capability. When higher layer parameter ul-FullPowerTransmission is set to 'fullpowerMode2' and the higher layer parameter codebookSubset or the higher layer parameter codebookSubsetDCI-0-2 is set to 'partialAndNonCoherent', and when the SRS-resourceSet with usage set to \"codebook\" includes at least one SRS resource with 4 ports and one SRS resource with 2 ports, the codebookSubset associated with the 2 -port SRS resource is 'nonCoherent'. The maximum transmission rank may be configured by the higher layer parameter maxRank in pusch-Config for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_1 and maxRankDCI-0-2 for PUSCH scheduled with DCI format 0_2.\n---\nIf pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH in pusch-Config contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous PUSCHs, \\( K_{2} \\) indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and mapping type. The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated valid SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH signalled in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\).\n---\nFor pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-rl7 in pusch-Config, each PUSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \\( K_{2} \\). The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 signalled in DCI format 0_1.\n---\n- When K > 2 and cyclicMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the first and second SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, respectively, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of K consecutive slots.\n---\n- When K > 2 and cyclicMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the second and first SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, respectively, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of the K consecutive slots.\n---\n- When \\( \\mathrm{K}>2 \\) and sequentialMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the second SRS resource set is applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, and the first SRS resource set is applied to the third and fourth slot of K consecutive slots, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of the K consecutive slots.\n---\nFor both PUSCH repetition Type A and PUSCH repetition Type B, when a DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\) indicates codepoint \"10\" or \"11\" for the SRS resource set indicator, the redundancy version to be applied on the \\( n \\)th transmission occasion (for PUSCH repetition Type A) of the TB, where \\( n=0,1, \\ldots K-1 \\), or \\( n \\)th actual repetition (for PUSCH repetition Type B , with the counting including the actual repetitions that are omitted) is determined according to Table 6.1.2.1-2 and Table 6.1.2.1-3. For all PUSCH repetitions associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 6.1.2.1-2, where \\( n \\) is counted only considering PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions associated with the same SRS resource set as the first transmission occasion or actual repetition. The redundancy version for PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions that are associated with an SRS resource set other than the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition is derived according to Table 6.1.2.1-3, where additional shifting operation for each redundancy version \\( r v_{s} \\) is configured by higher layer parameter sequenceOffsetforRV in PUSCH-Config and \\( n \\) is counted only considering PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions that are not associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition.\n---\n\\hline RNTI & PDCCH search space & pusch-ConfigCommon includes puschTimeDomainAllocationList & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAllocationList & PUSCH time domain resource allocation to apply \\\\\n---\n\\hline puschConfigCommon includes puschTimeDomainAll ocationList & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAll ocationList & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAlloc ationListDCI-0-1 & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAllocationLi st-ForMultiPUSCH or pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAllocationLi stForMultiPUSCH-17 & PUSCH time domain resource allocation to apply \\\\\n---\n\\hline pusch-ConfigCommon includes puschTimeDomainAllocation L ist & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAllocationL ist & pusch-Config includes puschTimeDomainAllocationListD Cl-0-2 & PUSCH time domain resource allocation to apply \\\\\n---\nIf the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource allocation type as part of the 'Frequency domain resource' assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch', for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or setting a higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config to 'dynamicSwitch' for DCI format 0_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation for DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or the higher layer parameter resourceAllocationDCI-0-2 for DCI format \\( 0 \\_2 \\).
