For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {subframe }}, \\mu \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.",
