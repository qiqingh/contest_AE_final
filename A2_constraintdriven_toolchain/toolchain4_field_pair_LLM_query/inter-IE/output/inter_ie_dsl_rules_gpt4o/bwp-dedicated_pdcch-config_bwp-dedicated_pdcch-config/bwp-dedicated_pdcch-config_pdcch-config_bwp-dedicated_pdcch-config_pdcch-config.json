    "evidence": "A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \\( 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,4 \\_0,4 \\_1,4 \\_2 \\) or \\( 1 \\_2 \\) decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \\( \\operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \\) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} \\) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of \\( N_{\\text {sym }}^{\\text {slot }} \\) symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the\n---\nHARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook of the same priority. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than \\( N \\) symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of \\( N \\) depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \\( \\mu \\) with \\( N=13 \\) for \\( \\mu=0, N=13 \\) for \\( \\mu=1, N=20 \\) for \\( \\mu=2, N=24 \\) for \\( \\mu=3, N=96 \\) for \\( \\mu=5 \\), and \\( N=192 \\) for \\( \\mu=6 \\).\n---\nIf a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex. For a ControlResourceSet without coresetPoollndex, the UE may assume that the ControlResourceSet is assigned with coresetPoollndex as 0 . When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], ControlResourceSets corresponding to different coresetPoolIndex values may be associated with different physical cell [Ds via activated TCI states of the ControlResourceSets, where ControlResourceSets corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and ControlResourceSets corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, the following operations are allowed:\n---\n- If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:\n---\nIf the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI] and with PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE receives an activation command for CORESET associated with each coresetPoollndex, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in one CC/DL BWP. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID.\n---\n- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets,\n---\nIf the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in different ControlResourceSets, and the UE receives the DM-RS for \\( \\mathrm{PDSCH}(\\mathrm{s}) \\) and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH(s) and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable.\n---\n- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet\n---\nA UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\). When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format \\( 0 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.\n---\n- searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon when pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH are not provided, for a DCI format \\( 4 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI\n---\n- searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon when pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH are not provided, for a DCI format \\( 4 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI - a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format 1 _ 0 with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG - a Type0B-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config\\( M T C H \\) for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, on the primary cell of the MCG\n---\n- searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH on secondary cell for a DCI format \\( 4 \\_0 \\) with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, and - a USS set configured by - SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType \\( = \\) ue-Specific for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, or SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI, or\n---\nIf a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID.\n---\n- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, pagingSearchSpace, peiSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, or a CSS set by PDCCH-Config, and\n---\n- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType \\( = \\) common;\n---\n- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType \\( = \\) common; - a USS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific.\n---\nA UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].\n---\nThe IE PDCCH-Config is used to configure UE specific or MBS multicast PDCCH parameters such as control resource sets (CORESET), search spaces and additional parameters for acquiring the PDCCH. If this IE is used for the scheduled SCell in case of cross carrier scheduling, the fields other than searchSpacesToAddModList and searchSpacesToReleaseList are absent. If the IE is used for a dormant BWP, the fields other than controlResourceSetToAddModList and controlResourceSetToReleaseList are absent. If this IE is used for MBS CFR, the field downlinkPreemptiom,tpc-PUSCH, tpc-SRS, uplinkCancellation, monitoringCapabilityConfig, and searchSpaceSwitchConfig are absent.\n---\ncontrolResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon. The network shall not use same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSetExt configured via SIB20 in this field.\n---\nThis parameter is used to configure SFN scheme for PDCCH: scheme 1 (sfnSchemeA) or TRP-based pre-compensation (sfnSchemeB).
