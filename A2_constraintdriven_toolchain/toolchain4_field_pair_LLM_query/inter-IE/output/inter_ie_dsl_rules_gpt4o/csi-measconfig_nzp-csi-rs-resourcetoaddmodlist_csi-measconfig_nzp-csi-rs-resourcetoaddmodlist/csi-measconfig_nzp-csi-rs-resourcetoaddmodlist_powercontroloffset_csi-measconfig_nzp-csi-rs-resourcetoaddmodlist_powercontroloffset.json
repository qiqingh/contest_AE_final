The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by higher layer parameter powerControOffsetSS or powerControlOffset.\n---\n- powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of \\( [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} \\) with 1 dB step size. For CQI calculation based on a pair of NZP CSI-RS resources, powerControlOffset of each NZP CSI-RS resource in the pair of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement is the assumed ratio of EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range of \\( [-8,15] \\mathrm{dB} \\) with 1 dB step size.\n---\n- The UE shall assume that the corresponding PDSCH signals for \\( v_{j} \\) layers transmitted on the \\( P \\) antenna ports of the CSI-RS resource in Group \\( j \\) would have a ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE equal to the powerControlOffset of the respective CSI-RS resource, for \\( j=1,2 \\).",
