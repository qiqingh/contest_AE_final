    "evidence": "For an SRS resource configured as periodic or semi-persistent by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, a periodicity \\( T_{\\text {SRS }} \\) (in slots) and slot offset \\( T_{\\text {offset }} \\) are configured according to the higher-layer parameter periodicityAndOffset- \\( p \\) or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRS-Resource [E, or periodicityAndOffset-p or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRSPosResource IE. Candidate slots in which the configured SRS resource may be used for SRS transmission are the slots satisfying\n---\nwhere the periodicity \\( T_{\\text {CSI-RS }} \\) (in slots) and slot offset \\( T_{\\text {offset }} \\) are obtained from the higher-layer parameter CSIResourcePeriodicityAndOffset, slotConfig or periodicityAndOffset-r17. The UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted in a candidate slot as described in clause 11.1 of [5, TS 38.213], clause 10.4B of [5, TS 38.213].\n---\n- the periodicity and slot offset for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, as given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, is one of \\( 2^{\\mu} X_{p} \\) slots where \\( X_{F}=10,20,40 \\), or 80 and where \\( \\mu \\) is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211].\n---\n- the periodicity for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, is given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet, is one of \\( 2^{\\mu} X_{p} \\) slots where \\( X_{F}=10,20,40 \\), or 80 and where \\( \\mu \\) is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211], applies to all resources in a TRS-ResourceSet. The slot offset given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by a TRS-ResourceSet provides the location of the first slot containing the periodic NZP CSI-RS resources configured by by a TRS-ResourceSet.\n---\n- periodicityAndOffset defines the CSI-RS periodicity and slot offset for periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS. All the CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with the same periodicity, while the slot offset can be same or different for different CSI-RS resources.\n---\n- Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher layer parameters periodicityAndOffset- \\( p \\) or periodicityAndOffset-sp for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource set SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet with different slot level periodicities. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset. For an SRS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', a list of zero up to four different available slot offset values from the reference slot \\( n+k \\) to the slot where the aperiodic SRS resource set is transmitted where \\( n \\) is the slot with triggering DCI and \\( k \\) is SlotOffset is defined by the higher layer parameter AvailableSlotOffset. The parameter AvailableSlotOffset can be configured up to 4 different values. For an SRSPosResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', the slot level offset is defined by the higher layer parameter slotOffset for each SRS resource.\n---\nThe UE is also configured a periodicity \\( S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} \\) in symbols or slots and an offset \\( S R_{\\text {OFFSET }} \\) in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If \\( S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }} \\) is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number \\( n_{s_{1} f}^{\\mu}[4 \\), TS 38.211] in a frame with number \\( n_{f} \\) if \\( \\left(n_{f} \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {frame }, \\mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\\mu}-S R_{\\text {OFFSET }}\\right) \\bmod S R_{\\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 \\).\n---\nThe UE shall setup the first SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (providing Periodicity and Offset value for the following condition) in the smtcl configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:\n---\nIf \\( \\operatorname{smtc} 2 \\) is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in smtc2 in the same MeasObjectNR, the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc 2 configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtcl configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the above condition.\n---\nIf \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in \\( s m t c 2-L P \\) in the same frequency (for intra frequency cell reselection) or different frequency (for inter frequency cell reselection), the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc2-LP configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtc configuration for that frequency. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell or serving cell (for cell reselection) meeting the above condition.  If smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtcl to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.\n---\nThe SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and NR PCell change. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon. \\\\\n---\nThe SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssbperiodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.\n---\nSecondary measurement timing configuration for SS corresponding to this MeasObjectNR with PCI listed in pci-List. For these SS, the periodicity is indicated by periodicity in smtc2 and the timing offset is equal to the offset indicated in periodicityAndOffset modulo periodicity. periodicity in smtc2 can only be set to a value strictly shorter than the periodicity indicated by periodicityAndOffset in smtc1 (e.g. if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf10, periodicity can only be set of sf5, if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf5, smtc2 cannot be configured).\n---\nThis field specifies the offset in units of slots between two repeated instances of a DL-PRS Resource corresponding to the same DL-PRS Resource ID within a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. The time duration spanned by one DL-PRS Resource Set containing repeated DL-PRS Resources should not exceed the periodicity configured by periodicityAndOffset. The field is mandatory present, if repetitionFactor is present. Otherwise, it is not present.\n---\nperiodicityAndOffset \\\\ SR periodicity and offset in number of symbols or slots (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.4) The following periodicities may be configured depending on the chosen subcarrier spacing:\n---\nNumber of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\). The UE ignores this field for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\). The maximum valid duration is periodicity- 1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).\n---\nSlots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\), only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8', 'sl10', 'sl16', and 'sl20' are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2', 'sl4', 'sl5', 'sl8' and 'sl10' are applicable.\n---\nThis parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingld UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to \\( n \\)-th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.",
