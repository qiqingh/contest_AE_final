If the UE is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD' if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block.\n---\n- The number of CSI-RS ports is given by \\( P_{\\text {CSI-RS }} \\in\\{4,8,12,16,24,32\\} \\) as configured by higher layer parameter nrofPorts.\n---\n- nrofPorts in resourceMapping defines the number of CSI-RS ports, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211].\n---\nAll CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same density and same nrofPorts, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for interference measurement.\n---\nFor MsgA PUSCH transmission, if the UE is not configured with msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts, the UE shall assume that 4 ports are configured per DM-RS CDM group for double-symbol DM-RS.
