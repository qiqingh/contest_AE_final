    "evidence": "- within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetId or ControlResourceSetZero and time domain resource determined by the higher layer parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, duration and monitoringSymbols WithinSlot of all search-space-sets configured by SearchSpace and time domain resource of search-space-set zero configured by searchSpaceZero associated with the CORESET as well as CORESET duration configured by ControlResourceSet with controlResourceSetld or ControlResourceSetZero. This resource not available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource sets (higher layer parameters rateMatchPatternGroup 1 and rateMatchPatternGroup2).\n---\n- an association between the search space set \\( s \\) and a CORESET \\( p \\) by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610 - a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of \\( k_{s} \\) slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of \\( o_{s} \\) slots, by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset or by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17\n---\n- a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of \\( k_{s} \\) slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of \\( o_{s} \\) slots, by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset or by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 - a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the CORESET for PDCCH monitoring within each slot where the UE monitors PDCCH, by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot\n---\nFor IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\). The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format \\( 2 \\_0 \\) and DCI format \\( 2 \\_5 \\). The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset). freqMonitorLocations Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set.\n---\nThe first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.",
