The length of the field is 6 bits;\n---\n- If the UE is configured with a number of RS resource indexes, up to the value of maxNrofPUSCHPathlossReferenceRSs, and a respective set of RS configurations for the number of RS resource indexes by PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS, the set of RS resource indexes can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index.
