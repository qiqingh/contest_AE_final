For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \\( \\mathrm{T}_{\\text {proc, } 1} \\) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot, if the first symbol of the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time scheduling the PDSCH was received in a later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain resource allocation.\n---\nresourceAllocationDCI-1-2 for DCI format 1 _2 or by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast for DCI format 4_2.  If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI.

HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \\( j \\) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \\( i \\) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \\( i \\), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.

The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \\( 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.\n---\n6.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain  When the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and no CSI report by a DCI or by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, or the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and a CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a DCI, the 'Time domain resource assignment' field value \\( m \\) of the DCI or the PUSCH time resource allocation field value \\( m \\) of the RAR UL grant or of the fallbackRAR UL grant provides a row index \\( m+1 \\) to an allocated table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \\( K_{2} \\), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \\( S \\) and the allocation length \\( L \\), the PUSCH mapping type, the number of slots used for TBS determination (if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present in the resource allocation table), and the number of repetitions (if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission.\n---\n- A slot is not counted in the number of \\( N \\cdot K \\) slots for PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\) if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst.\n---\n- A slot is not counted in the number of \\( N \\cdot K \\) slots for a PUSCH transmission of TB processing over multiple slots if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst.\n---\n- A slot is not counted in the number of \\( N \\cdot K \\) slots for a PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by RAR UL grant, if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-Configuration Common if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst.\n---\n- For the case of a reduced capability half-duplex UE, and when AvailableSlotCounting is enabled, the UE determines \\( N \\cdot K \\) slots for a PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition type A scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), or for a PUSCH transmission of TB processing over multiple slots scheduled by DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\), based on the TDRA information field value in the DCI format \\( 0 \\_1 \\) or \\( 0 \\_2 \\).

The second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion, and the second PDSCH transmission occasion shall have the same number of symbols as the first PDSCH transmission occasion.

If the value \\( \\bar{K} \\) is not configured via the higher layer parameter StartingSymbolOffsetK, \\( \\bar{K}=0 \\) shall be assumed by the UE.
