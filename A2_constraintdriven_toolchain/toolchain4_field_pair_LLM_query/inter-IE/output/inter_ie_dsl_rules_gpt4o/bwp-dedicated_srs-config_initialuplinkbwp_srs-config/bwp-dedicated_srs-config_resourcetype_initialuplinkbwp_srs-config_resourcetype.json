The field is optional Need R if the NZP-CSI-RS-Resources in the associated resourceSethave the resourceType aperiodic and unifiedtci-StateType is configured. The field is absent otherwise. \\\\\n---\nList of references to CSI-IM resources used for CSI measurement and reporting in a CSI-RS resource set.

If nrofReportedGroups-r17 is configured and resourceType is set to 'periodic' or 'semipersistent', then the network configures 2 resource sets (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.2 and 5.2.1.4.2).\n---\nConfiguration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and the target SRS. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS/DL-PRS-PDC (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
