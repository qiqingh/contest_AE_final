    "evidence": "Each Reporting Setting CSI-ReportConfig is associated with a single downlink BWP (indicated by higher layer parameter BWP-Id) given in the associated CSI-ResourceConfig for channel measurement and contains the parameter(s) for one CSI reporting band: codebook configuration including codebook subset restriction, time-domain behavior, frequency granularity for CQI and PMI, measurement restriction configurations, and the CSI-related quantities to be reported by the UE such as the layer indicator (LI), L1-RSRP, L1-SINR, CRI, and SSBRI (SSB Resource Indicator) and Capability[Set]Index.  The time domain behavior of the CSI-ReportConfig is indicated by the higher layer parameter reportConfigType and can be set to 'aperiodic', 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH', 'semiPersistentOnPUSCH', or 'periodic'. For 'periodic' and 'semiPersistentOnPUCCH/'semiPersistentOnPUSCH' CSI reporting, the configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The higher layer parameter reportQuantity indicates the CSI-related, L1-RSRP-related, L1-SINR-related or Capability[Set][ndex-related quantities to report. The reportFreqConfiguration indicates the reporting granularity in the frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI reporting is wideband or sub-band. The timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements parameter in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel measurements and timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements can be configured to enable time domain restriction for interference measurements. The CSI-ReportConfig can also contain CodebookConfig, which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II, Enhanced Type II CSI, or Further Enhanced Type II Port Selection including codebook subset restriction when applicable, and configurations of group-based reporting.",
