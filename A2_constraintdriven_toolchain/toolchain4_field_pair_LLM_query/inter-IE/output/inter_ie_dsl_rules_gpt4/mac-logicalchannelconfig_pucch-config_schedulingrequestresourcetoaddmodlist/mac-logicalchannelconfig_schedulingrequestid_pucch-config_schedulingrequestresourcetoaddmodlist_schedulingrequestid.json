The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP.

The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\nA UE can be provided, by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.24 for the UE to transmit PUCCH [11, TS 38.321].

If the UE is provided only the first configuration, the UE transmits a PUCCH with LRR for either set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\). If the UE is provided both the first and second configurations, the UE uses the first configuration to transmt a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and the second configuration to transmit a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1}[11 \\), TS 38.321].\n---\n- \\( \\operatorname{BPRE}(\\mathrm{i})=\\left(O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}}(i)+O_{\\mathrm{CRC}}(i)\\right) / N_{R E}(i) \\) - \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}(i) \\) is a number of HARQ-ACK information bits that the UE determines as described in clause 9.1.2.1 or 16.5.1.1 for Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook and as described in clause 9.1.3.1 or 9.1.3.3 or 16.5.2.1 for Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook, or as described in clause 9.1.4 for Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook.

For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 .\n---\nIf \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ}-\\mathrm{ACK}} \\) for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as \\( n_{\\text {HARQ-ACK }}=\\sum_{c=0}^{N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\text {DL }} \\sum_{m=0}^{M_{c}-1} N_{m, c}^{\\text {received }}}+ \\sum_{c=0}^{N_{\\text {cells }}^{\\mathrm{DL}}{ }^{-1}} \\sum_{m=0}^{M_{c}-1} N_{m, c}^{\\text {received, CBG }} \\) where",
