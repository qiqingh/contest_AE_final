When the field is absent the UE applies the value off. The field is not applicable for format 0 and 1.\n---\nA UE can be provided, by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.24 for the UE to transmit PUCCH [11, TS 38.321]. If the PCell or the PSCell is associated with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,0} \\), and with sets \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\) and \\( \\bar{q}_{1,1} \\), the UE can be provided by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR. If the UE is provided only the first configuration, the UE transmits a PUCCH with LRR for either set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) or \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1} \\). If the UE is provided both the first and second configurations, the UE uses the first configuration to transmt a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,0} \\) and the second configuration to transmit a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \\( \\bar{q}_{0,1}[11 \\), TS 38.321].  The UE can provide in a first PUSCH MAC CE index(es) for at least corresponding SCell(s) with radio link quality worse than \\( \\mathrm{Q}_{\\text {out }, \\mathrm{LR}} \\), indication(s) of presence of \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) for corresponding SCell(s), and index(es) \\( q_{\\text {new }} \\) for a periodic CSIRS configuration or for a SS/PBCH block provided by higher layers, as described in [11, TS 38.321], if any, for corresponding SCell(s). After 28 symbols from a last symbol of a PDCCH reception with a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same HARQ process number as for the transmission of the first PUSCH and having a toggled NDI field value, the UE\n---\nA PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index 0 or of priority index 1 . For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 .\n---\nfor PDSCH receptions scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions, or for SPS PDSCH reception, or for a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, and if \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\\mathrm{CSI}} \\leq 11 \\), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \\( n_{\\mathrm{HARQ} \\text {-ACK }} \\) for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as\n---\nUCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and CSI. UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1. For the remaining of this clause, any reference to \\( S R \\) is applicable for \\( S R \\) and/or for \\( L R R \\).  A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode \\( = \\) separate, at least one of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.\n---\n- PUCCH format 0 if - the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols, - the number of HARQ-ACK information bits with positive or negative SR (HARQ-ACK/SR bits) is 1 or 2\n---\nIf a UE is provided a first interlace of \\( M_{\\text {Interlace }, 0}^{\\text {PUCC }} \\) PRBs by interlacet in InterlaceAllocation and transmits a PUCCH with \\( O_{\\text {ACK }} \\) HARQ-ACK information bits and \\( O_{\\text {CRC }} \\) bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 , the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace if \\( \\left(O_{\\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\\mathrm{CRC}}\\right) \\leq M_{\\mathrm{Interlace}, 0}^{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{sc}, \\mathrm{crl}}^{\\mathrm{RB}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{symb}-\\mathrm{UCl}}^{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} \\cdot Q_{m} \\cdot r \\); otherwise, if the UE is provided a second interlace by interlacel in PUCCH-format2 or PUCCH-format3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first and second interlaces. 9.2.4 UE procedure for reporting SR\n---\n- the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI reports in a PUSCH if the PUCCH resource overlaps in time with a PUSCH transmission, as described in clause 9.3, and does not transmit SR. In case the PUCCH resource overlaps in time with multiple PUSCH transmissions, the PUSCH for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI is selected as described in clause 9. If the PUSCH transmission by the UE is not in response to a DCI format detection and the UE multiplexes only CSI reports, the timing conditions are not applicable\n---\nIf a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE determines a value of \\( m_{0} \\) and \\( m_{\\mathrm{CS}} \\) for computing a value of cyclic\n---\nIf a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in response to a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, the UE does not expect to be provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI.  A UE is configured by maxCodeRate a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR, and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4.\n---\n- if the PUCCH resource for the second PUCCH includes PUCCH format 2, 3, or 4 and additionally includes \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\mathrm{SR} \\) bits of priority \\( 1, O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1} \\) is replaced by \\( O_{\\mathrm{ACK}_{1} 1}+O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) where \\( O_{\\mathrm{SR}_{1} 1} \\) is determined according to clause 9.2.5.1\n---\nThe SRS request field [5, TS38.212] in DCI format \\( 0 \\_1,1 \\_1,0 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present), \\( 1 \\_2 \\) (if SRS request field is present) indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of [5, TS 38.212]. The 2-bit SRS request field in DCI format 2_3 indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in clause 7.3 of [5, TS 38.212] and defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB', or indicates the SRS transmission on a set of serving cells configured by higher layers if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA'.  For PUCCH and SRS on the same carrier, a UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying only CSI report(s), or only L1-RSRP report(s), or only L1SINR report(s). A UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured or aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK, link recovery request (as defined in clause 9.24 of [6,38.213]) and/or SR. In the case that SRS is not transmitted due to overlap with PUCCH, only the SRS symbol(s) that overlap with PUCCH symbol(s) are dropped. PUCCH shall not be transmitted when aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted to overlap in the same symbol with PUCCH carrying semi-persistent/periodic CSI report(s) or semi-persistent/periodic L1-RSRP report(s) only, or only L1-SINR report(s).",
