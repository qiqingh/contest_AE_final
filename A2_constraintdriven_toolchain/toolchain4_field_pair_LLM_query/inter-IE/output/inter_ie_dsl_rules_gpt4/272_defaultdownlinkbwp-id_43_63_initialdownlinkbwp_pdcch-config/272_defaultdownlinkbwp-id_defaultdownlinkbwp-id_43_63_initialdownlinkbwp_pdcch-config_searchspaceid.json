If the UE detects the DCI format from two PDCCH receptions in search space sets \\( s_{i} \\) and \\( s_{j} \\) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \\( s_{j} \\) and \\( s_{i} \\), respectively, as described in clause 10.1 , the UE considers the PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format to be the one from the two PDCCH receptions that ends later.  For a serving cell, a UE can be provided by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id a default DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a default DL BWP by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id, the default DL BWP is the initial DL BWP.",
