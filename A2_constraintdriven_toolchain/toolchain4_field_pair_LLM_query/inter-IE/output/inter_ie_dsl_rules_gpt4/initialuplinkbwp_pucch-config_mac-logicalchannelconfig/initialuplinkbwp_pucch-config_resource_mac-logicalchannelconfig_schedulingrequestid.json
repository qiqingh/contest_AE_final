The Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-PRS resources for new transmission when triggered by SL-PRS resource request (clause 6.1.3.74). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.\n---\nAll triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and \\( s l \\)-retx-BSR-Timer and \\( s l \\) -periodic-BSR-Timer shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.  NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.\n---\n\\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1139 & - & F & Corrections on MCS selection when UE performing TX resource (re)selection check & 16.6.0 \\\\ \\hline & RP-93 & RP-212441 & 1140 & 1 & F & Correction on SR procedure for SL-CSI reporting & 16.6 .0 \\\\\n---\n- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config\n---\nIf the UE is provided SPS-PUCCH-AN-List and transmits \\( O_{\\mathrm{UCl}} \\mathrm{UCI} \\) information bits that include only HARQ-ACK information bits in response to one or more SPS PDSCH receptions and SR, if any, the UE determines a PUCCH resource to be\n---\n- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.
