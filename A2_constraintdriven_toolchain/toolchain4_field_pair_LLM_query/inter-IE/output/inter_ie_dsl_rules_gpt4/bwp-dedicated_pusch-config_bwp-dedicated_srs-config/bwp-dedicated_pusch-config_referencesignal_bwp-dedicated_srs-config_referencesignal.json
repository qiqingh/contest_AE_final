If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the referenceSignal value in PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS through the link to a corresponding pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot \\( k+ 3 \\cdot N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame, } \\mu} \\) where \\( k \\) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH\n---\nA UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell [11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the first DCI format scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block since a power headroom report was triggered if the power headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format. Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus \\( T_{\\text {proc. } 2}=T_{\\text {proc. } 2} \\) where \\( T_{\\text {proc. } 2} \\) is determined according to [6, TS 38.214] assuming \\( d_{2, l}=1, d_{2,2}=0 \\), and with \\( \\mu_{D L} \\) corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using the configured grant.\n---\n- if UE is configured with TCI-State configurations with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE may use a spatial domain transmit filter that is same as the spatial domain receive filter the UE may use to receive the DL reference signal associated with the indicated TCI state.\n---\n- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \\( n \\) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on SRS transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \\( n+3 N_{\\text {slot }}^{\\text {sub frame }}{ }^{\\mu} \\) where \\( \\mu \\) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.
