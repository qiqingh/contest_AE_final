In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].\n---\n- For the UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes for broadcast reception, REs indicated by 'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS' in PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MCCH configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for PDSCH. - Each RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS configuration contains v-Shift consisting of LTE-CRS-vshift(s), nrofCRS-Ports consisting of LTE-CRS antenna ports 1, 2 or 4 ports, carrierFreqDL representing the offset in units of 15 kHz subcarriers from (reference) point A to the LTE carrier centre subcarrier location, carrierBandwidthDL representing the LTE carrier bandwidth, and may also configure mbsfn-SubframeConfigList representing MBSFN subframe configuration. A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe. - If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:",
