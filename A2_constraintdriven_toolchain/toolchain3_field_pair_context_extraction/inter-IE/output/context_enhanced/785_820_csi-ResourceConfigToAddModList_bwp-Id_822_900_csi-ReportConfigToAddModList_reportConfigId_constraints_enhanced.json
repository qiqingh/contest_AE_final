The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits; - \\( \\mathrm{S}_{1} \\) : This field indicates the activation/deactivation status of the Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration within csi-ReportConfigToAddModList, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. So refers to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the lowest CSI-ReportConfigId within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH, \\( \\mathrm{S}_{1} \\) to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the second lowest CSI-ReportConfigId and so on. If the number of report configurations within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH in the indicated BWP is less than \\( i+1 \\), MAC entity shall ignore the \\( S_{1} \\) field. The \\( S_{1} \\) field is set to 1 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration shall be activated. The \\( \\mathrm{S}_{1} \\) field is set to 0 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration i shall be deactivated;",
