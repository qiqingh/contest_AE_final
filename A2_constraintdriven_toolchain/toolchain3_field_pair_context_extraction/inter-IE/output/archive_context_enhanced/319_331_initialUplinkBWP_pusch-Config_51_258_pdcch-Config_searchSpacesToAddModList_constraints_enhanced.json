The UE applies the indicated SRI(s) and TPMI(s) to one or more PUSCH repetitions according to the associated SRS resource set of a PUSCH repetition according to clause 6-1.2.1. Each TPMI, based on indicated codepoint of SRS Resource Set indicator, is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the corresponding SRI when multiple SRS resources are configured for the applicable SRS resource set, or if a single SRS resource is configured for the applicable SRS resource set TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers \\( \\{0 \\ldots v-1\\} \\) and that corresponds to the SRS resource. For one or two TPMI(s), the transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a number of antenna ports equal to the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config for the indicated SRI(s), as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211]. When two SRIs are indicated, the UE shall expect the nrofSRS-Ports for the two indicated SRS resources to be the same. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter txConfig set to 'codebook', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. Each of the indicated one or two SRI(s) in slot \\( n \\) is associated with the most recent transmission of SRS resource of associated SRS resource set identified by the SRI, where the SRS resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI. When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook', the UE is not expected to be configured with different number of SRS resources in the two SRS resource sets.  When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the most recent transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, the PDCCH candidate that starts earlier in time is used.",
