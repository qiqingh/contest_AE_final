For operation on the primary cell or on a secondary cell, a UE is provided an initial UL BWP by initialUplinkBWP. If the UE is configured with a supplementary UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial UL BWP on the supplementary UL carrier by initialUplinkBWP.  If a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP for receptions and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a carrier of the primary cell.",
