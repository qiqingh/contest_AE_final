If the value of this field is set to FFF, this field indicates that no valid timing adjustment is available for the PTAG of the LTM target cell; otherwise, this field indicates the index value \\( T_{A} \\) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6], and that the UE can skip the Random Access procedure for this LTM cell switch. If tag-Id-ptr is configured for the TCI state indicated by the TCI state ID field in the LTM target cell and tag-Id-ptr is set to value \\( n l \\), this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag2-Id of the LTM target cell; otherwise, this field indicates the TA for the TAG indicated by the tag-id of the LTM target cell. The length of the field is 12 bits;",
