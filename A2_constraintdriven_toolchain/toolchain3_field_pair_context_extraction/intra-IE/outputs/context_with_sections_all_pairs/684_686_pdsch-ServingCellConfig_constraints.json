    "original_sentence": "Configure the number of bits for the field \"HARQ process number\" in DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1). maxMMMO-Layers Indicates the maximum number of MIMO layers to be used for PDSCH in this DL BWP. If not configured, the UE uses the maxMIMO-Layers configuration in IE PDSCHServingCellConfig of the serving cell to which this BWP belongs, when the UE operates in this BWP. The value of maxMIMO-Layers for a DL BWP shall be smaller than or equal to the value of maxMIMO-Layers configured in IE PDSCH-ServingCellConfig of the serving cell to which this BWP belongs. For MBS multicast, indicates the maximum number of MIMO layers to be used for group-common PDSCH of MBS multicast in this CFR. If not configured for CFR, the UE applies value 1. The value of maxMIMO-Layers for a CFR shall be smaller than or equal to the value of maxMIMO-Layers configured in PDSCH-ServingCellConfig IE of the serving cell to which this CFR belongs.",
