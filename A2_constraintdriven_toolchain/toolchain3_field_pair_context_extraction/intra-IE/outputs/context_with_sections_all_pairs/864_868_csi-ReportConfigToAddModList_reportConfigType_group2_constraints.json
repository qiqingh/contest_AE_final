The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH. For PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell, and with ackNackFeedbackMode = joint for the active UL BWP, detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed prior to detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the second CORESETs. The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator field of 3 bits, provided by resourceList for PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2.

    "original_sentence": "Procedures for a RedCap UE are same as described for a UE in all other clauses of this document unless stated otherwise. In this clause, the term 'UE' refers to a RedCap UE. A UE expects the initial DL BWP and the active DL BWP after the UE (re)establishes dedicated RRC connection to be smaller than or equal to the maximum DL bandwidth that the UE supports. A UE can be provided a DL BWP by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, and an UL BWP by intitalUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. If mitialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonSIB indicates an UL BWP that is larger than a maximum UL BWP that a UE supports, the UE expects to be provided an UL BWP by intialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. A UE can be provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated a DL BWP, other than the initial DL BWP. A UE can be provided by BWP-UplinkDedicated an UL BWP, other than the initial UL BWP, that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL band width that the UE supports. If a UE is provided RACH-ConfigCommon-RedCap or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA-RedCap, the UE uses corresponding parameters to perform the procedures in clauses 8.1, 8.1A, and 8.3; otherwise, the UE uses corresponding parameters from RACH-ConfigCommon or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA. If a UE is provided initialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB and does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE transmits PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.1 using a PUCCH resource set provided by pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap, except that frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission is disabled if disable-FH-PUCCH is provided in PUCCH-ConfigCommonRedCap. If frequency hopping of the PUCCH transmission is disabled then, for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial cyclic shift indexes as r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} \\bmod N_{\\mathrm{CS}} and determines the PRB index as - R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }}+R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset-add }}+\\left\\lfloor r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\\mathrm{CS}}\\right\\rfloor , if BWP-part = 'FromLowerEdge' - \\quad N_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\mathrm{size}}-R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset }}-R B_{\\mathrm{BWP}}^{\\text {offset-add }}-1-\\left\\lfloor r_{\\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\\mathrm{CS}}\\right\\rfloor , otherwise",
