HARQ-ACK information reporting is associated with a CORESET through a reception of a PDCCH with a DCI format triggering the reporting of the HARQ-ACK information by the UE. For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes P H assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively. If a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PUCCH-SCell. A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index 0 or of priority index 1 . For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 . If a UE is provided one PUCCH-Config - if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config If a UE is provided two PUCCH-Config",

For PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes.

A UE expects the initial DL BWP and the active DL BWP after the UE (re)establishes dedicated RRC connection to be smaller than or equal to the maximum DL bandwidth that the UE supports. A UE can be provided a DL BWP by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, and an UL BWP by intitalUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. If mitialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonSIB indicates an UL BWP that is larger than a maximum UL BWP that a UE supports, the UE expects to be provided an UL BWP by intialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. A UE can be provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated a DL BWP, other than the initial DL BWP. A UE can be provided by BWP-UplinkDedicated an UL BWP, other than the initial UL BWP, that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL band width that the UE supports. If a UE is provided RACH-ConfigCommon-RedCap or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA-RedCap, the UE uses corresponding parameters to perform the procedures in clauses 8.1, 8.1A, and 8.3; otherwise, the UE uses corresponding parameters from RACH-ConfigCommon or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA. If a UE is provided initialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB and does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE transmits PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.1 using a PUCCH resource set provided by pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap, except that frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission is disabled if disable-FH-PUCCH is provided in PUCCH-ConfigCommonRedCap.
