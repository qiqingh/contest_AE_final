For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP.

For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP.

Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request.

If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR.",

The MAC entity shall prioritize any MAC CE listed in a higher order than 'data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH' over NR sidelink transmission. 5.4.3.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to clauses 5.4.3.1 and 6.1.2. NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome. 5.4.4 Scheduling Request The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission. The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured. Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or a DSR (clause 5.4.9) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request (clause 5.25 ) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8).",

SRB2 has a lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security activation; - SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all using DCCH logical channel; - SRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information, all using DCCH logical channel.
