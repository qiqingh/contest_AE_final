The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used for the downlink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by higher layer parameter nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH, and when no configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 8 processes. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1 \\_0,1 \\_1,4 \\_0,4 \\_1,4 \\_2 or 1 \\_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise.

The time and frequency resources that can be used by the UE to report CSI are controlled by the gNB.

For CQI, PMI, CRI, SSBRI, LI, RI, L1-RSRP, L1-SINR, Capability[Set]Index a UE is configured by higher layers with \\mathrm{N} >= 1 CSI-ReportConfig Reporting Settings, \\mathrm{M} >= 1 CSI-ResourceConfig Resource Settings, and one or two list(s) of trigger states (given by the higher layer parameters CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList and CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCHTriggerStateList). Each trigger state in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList contains a list of associated CSI-ReportConfigs indicating the Resource Set IDs for channel and optionally for interference.

The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell. The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0 \\_0 or 0 \\_1 , the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config.

For a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB. A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0 \\_0,0 \\_1 or 0 \\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321].

The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n -th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystem Information, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceBroadcast, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceld cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. searchSpaceType Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for. ue-Specific Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS). The UE monitors the DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI (if configured), and SP-CSI-RNTI (if configured)",

NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome. 5.4.4 Scheduling Request The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission. The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration is configured. Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFDRS set and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC.

Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8).

The case when T_{\\text {proc }, 2}^{S L} is equal to T_{\\text {proc }, 0}^{S L} is assuming that SCI format 2-C is received. T_{\\text {proc }, 0}^{S L} and T_{\\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} are specified in clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7]. NOTE 3B4: For Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by an explicit Inter-UE Coordination Request in Scheme 1, whether or not to transmit the Inter-UE Coordination Information upon the Inter-UE Coordination Request reception is determined by UE implementation subject to Release-16 procedure of UL/SL prioritization, LTE SL/NR SL prioritization, and congestion control. NOTE 3B5: If configured by RRC, si-IUC-Explicit set to enabled and an SL-IUC request is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair of a unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer the resource selection window, resource set type (i.e., preferred resource set), L1 priority, the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH transmission and the resource reservation period for preferred resource set. If configured by RRC, sl-IUC-Explicit set to enabled and an SL-IUC request is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair of a unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer resource set type (i.e., non-preferred resource set) and the resource selection window for non-preferred resource set. NOTE 3B6: If either sl-IUC-Explicit or sl-IUC-Condition is configured as enabled, UE considers the reception of preferred and non-preferred resource is enabled. NOTE 3B7: When sl-TriggerConditionCoordInfo is set to value 0 , for groupcast or broadcast of Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by a condition in Scheme 1, which Destination Layer-2 ID (and the corresponding cast-type) a UE selects among Destination Layer-2 IDs that are already used or interested in NR sidelink transmission is up to the UE implementation.",

For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX Command indication or for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery or for SL-PRS Resource Request, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR. Each sidelink logical channel and Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. If the SL-CSI reporting procedure is enabled by RRC, the SL-CSI reporting is mapped to one SR configuration for all PC5-RRC connections. The SR configuration of the SL-CSI reporting triggered according to 5.22.1.7 is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4).

Furthermore, the UE transmitting SL-SCH Data determines the SL DRX Active time based on SL DRX timers that are running (e.g., sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer, sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GCInactivityTimer, sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer) or will be running in the future (e.g., sl-dræ-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer, sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer, sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer) at the UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data.
