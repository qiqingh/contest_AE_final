When the UE is configured by higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' or is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber, and the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the first PDSCH transmission occasion is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL, the mapping of the TCI states to PDSCH transmission occasions is determined according to clause 5.1.2.1 by replacing the indicated TCI states with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the first PDSCH transmission occasion. In this case, if the 'QCL-TypeD' in both of the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET.

Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Typel for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type 2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread\\} - 'typeB': \\{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\\} - 'typeC': \\{Doppler shift, average delay\\} - 'typeD': \\{Spatial Rx parameter\\}",
