The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH. For PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell, and with ackNackFeedbackMode = joint for the active UL BWP, detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed prior to detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the second CORESETs. The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator field of 3 bits, provided by resourceList for PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used. For the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size R_{\\text {PUCCH }} of resourceList is larger than eight, when a UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a last DCI format in a PDCCH reception, among DCI formats with a value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index r_{\\text {PUCCH }}, 0 <= r_{\\text {PUCCH }} <= R_{\\text {PUCCH }}-1 , as ETSI --- Page 109 ---",
