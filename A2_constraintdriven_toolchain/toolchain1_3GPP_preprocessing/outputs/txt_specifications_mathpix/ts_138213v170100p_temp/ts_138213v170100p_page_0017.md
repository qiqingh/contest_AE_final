rimInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold. The UE determines the indication period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link monitoring resources and the DRX period.

The physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is assessed, out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold \( Q_{\text {out }} \) for all resources in the set of resources for radio link monitoring. When the radio link quality is better than the threshold \( Q_{m} \) for any resource in the set of resources for radio link monitoring, the physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is assessed, in-sync to higher layers.

6 Link recovery procedures
A UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set \( \bar{q}_{0} \) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList and a set \( \bar{q}_{1} \) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList or candidateBeamRSListExt or candidateBeamRSSCellList for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. Instead of the sets \( \bar{q}_{0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1} \), for each BWP of a serving cell, the UE can be provided respective two sets \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes that can be activated by a MAC CE [11 TS 38.321] and corresponding two sets \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList l and candidateBeamRSList2, respectively, for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. The set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) is associated with the set \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \) and the set \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) is associated with the set \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \).

If the UE is not provided \( \bar{q}_{0} \) by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \( \bar{q}_{0} \) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH. If the UE is not provided \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, where the UE is provided two coresetPoollndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoollndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set \( \bar{q}_{0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \), or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set \( \bar{q}_{0} \) includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. The UE expects the set \( \bar{q}_{0} \) to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \), the UE expects the set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or the set \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) to include up to a number of \( N_{\mathrm{BFD}} \) RS indexes indicated by capabilityparametername. If the UE is not provided \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \), and if a number of active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs is larger than \( N_{\mathrm{BFD}} \), the UE determines the set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs corresponding to search space sets according to an ascending order for monitoring periodicity. If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index.

If a UE
- is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell,
- is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on the active DL BWP of the serving cells, and
- is provided SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI

SS/PBCH block indexes associated with a physical cell identity other than the one provided by physCellld in ServingCellConfigCommon can be provided in either \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \) set and the corresponding \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) set is associated with the physical cell identity.

The UE expects single port RS in the set \( \bar{q}_{0} \), or \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \), or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \). The UE expects single-port or two-port CSI-RS with frequency density equal to 1 or 3 REs per RB in the set \( \bar{q}_{1} \), or \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \), or \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \). The thresholds \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }, \mathrm{LR}} \) and \( \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{LR}} \) correspond to the default value of rimInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold, as described in [10, TS 38.133] for \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }} \), and to the value provided by rsrp-ThresholdSSB or rsrp-ThresholdBFR, respectively.
