16.3.1 UE procedure for receiving PSFCH with control information

A UE that transmitted a PSSCH scheduled by a SCI format 2-A/2-B/2-C that indicates HARQ feedback enabled, attempts to receive associated PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information according to PSFCH resources determined as described in clause 16.3.0. The UE determines an ACK or a NACK value for HARQ-ACK information provided in each PSFCH resource as described in [8-4, TS 38.101-4]. The UE does not determine both an ACK value and a NACK value at a same time for a PSFCH resource.

For each PSFCH reception occasion, from a number of PSFCH reception occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report to higher layers. For generating the HARQ-ACK information, the UE can be indicated by a SCI format to perform one of the following
- if the UE receives a PSFCH associated with a SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of "10" or a SCI format 2-C
- report to higher layers HARQ-ACK information with same value as a value of HARQ-ACK information that the UE determines from the PSFCH reception
- if the UE receives a PSFCH associated with a SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of " 01 "
- report an ACK value to higher layers if the UE determines an ACK value from at least one PSFCH reception occasion from the number of PSFCH reception occasions in PSFCH resources corresponding to every identity \( M_{\mathrm{ID}} \) of UEs that the UE expects to receive corresponding PSSCHs as described in clause 16.3; otherwise, report a NACK value to higher layers
- if the PSFCH reception occasion is associated with a SCI format 2-B or a SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of "11"
- report to higher layers an ACK value if the UE determines absence of PSFCH reception for the PSFCH reception occasion; otherwise, report a NACK value to higher layers

A UE that transmitted SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \), indicating one or more reserved resources in a resource pool enabled by interUECoordinationScheme2, attempts to receive associated PSFCH with conflict information in a resource pool with PSFCH resources that the UE determines as described in clause 16.3.0. If the UE determines presence of a resource conflict based on conflict information in a PSFCH reception, the UE reports the resource conflict to higher layers
- if slotLevelResourceExclusionScheme2 is not provided, the UE reports resources overlapping with a next in time reserved resource indicated by the SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \)
- if slotLevelResourceExclusionScheme2 is provided, the UE reports resources in a slot of a next in time reserved resource indicated by the SCI format 1-A

If a UE receives a PSFCH with conflict information corresponding to a reserved resource indicated in an SCI format 1A, the UE receives the PSFCH in the resource pool in a slot determined based on PSFCHOccasionScheme2
- If PSFCHOccasionScheme2 = 'followSCI', the UE receives the PSFCH in a first slot that includes PSFCH resources and is at least a number of slots, provided by sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH, of the resource pool after a slot of a PSCCH transmission that provides the SCI format 1-A. The PSFCH resource is in a slot that is at least \( T_{3} \) slots [6, TS 38.214] before the resource associated with the conflict information; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PSFCH with conflict information
- If PSFCHOccasionScheme2 = 'follow ReservedResource', the UE receives the PSFCH in a latest slot that includes PSFCH resources and is at least \( T_{3} \) slots before a slot of the resource associated with conflict information. The PSFCH resource is in a slot that is at least s/-MinTimeGapPSFCH slots after a slot of a PSCCH transmission that provides the SCI format 1-A; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PSFCH with conflict information
16.4 UE procedure for transmitting PSCCH

A UE can be provided a number of symbols in a resource pool, by sl-TimeResourcePSCCH, starting from a second symbol that is available for SL transmissions in a slot, and a number of PRBs in the resource pool, by slFreqResourcePSCCH, starting from the lowest PRB of the lowest sub-channel of the associated PSSCH, for a PSCCH transmission with a SCI format 1-A.
