monitored by the UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP on the PSCell.

A UE can be configured for each DL BWP of a SpCell [11, TS 38.321] with a set of resource indexes, through a corresponding set of RadioLinkMonitoringRS, for radio link monitoring by failureDetectionResources. The UE is provided either a CSI-RS resource configuration index, by csi-RS-Index, or a SS/PBCH block index, by ssb-Index. The UE can be configured with up to \( N_{\text {LR-RLM }} \) RadioLinkMonitoringRS for link recovery procedures, as described in clause 6, and for radio link monitoring. From the \( N_{\mathrm{LR}-\mathrm{RLM}} \) RadioLinkMonitoringRS, up to \( N_{\mathrm{RLM}} \) RadioLinkMonitoringRS can be used for radio link monitoring depending on \( L_{\text {max }} \) as described in Table 5-1, wherein \( L_{\text {max }} \) is as defined in clause 4.1, and up to two RadioLinkMonitoringRS can be used for link recovery procedures.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, when a UE is provided a SS/PBCH block index by ssb-Index, the UE is expected to perform radio link monitoring using SS/PBCH block(s) in the discovery burst transmission window as described in clause 4.1, where the SS/PBCH block(s) have candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-Index.

If the UE is not provided RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided for PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS
- the UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH reception if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes only one RS
- if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qclType set to 'typeD' [6, TS 38.214] and the UE uses the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for radio link monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD'
- the UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic or semi-persistent RS
- For \( L_{\text {max }}=4 \), the UE selects the \( N_{\text {RLM }} \) RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in CORESETs associated with the search space sets in an order from the shortest monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in clause 10.1.

A UE does not expect to use more than \( N_{\text {RLM }} \) RadioLinkMonitoringRS for radio link monitoring when the UE is not provided RadioLinkMonitoringRS.

Values of \( N_{\text {LR-RLM }} \) and \( N_{\text {RLM }} \) for different values of \( L_{\text {max }} \) are given in Table 5-1.

\hline\( L_{\text {max }} \) & \( N_{\text {LR-RLM }} \) & \( N_{\text {RLM }} \) \\

\hline 64 & 8 & 8 \\

For a CSI-RS resource configuration, powerControlOffsetSS is not applicable and a UE expects to be provided only 'noCDM' from cdm-Type, only 'one' and 'three' from density, and only '1 port' from nrofPorts [6, TS 38.214].

If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS for the active DL BWP or, if RadioLinkMonitoringRS is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH receptions in CORESETS on the active DL BWP.

In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time period defined in [10, TS 38.133] against thresholds ( \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }} \) and \( \mathrm{Q}_{1 n} \) ) configured by rimInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold. The UE determines the indication period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link monitoring resources and 10 msec .

In DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time period defined in [10, TS 38.133], against thresholds ( \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }} \) and \( \mathrm{Q}_{\mathbf{m}} \) ) provided by
