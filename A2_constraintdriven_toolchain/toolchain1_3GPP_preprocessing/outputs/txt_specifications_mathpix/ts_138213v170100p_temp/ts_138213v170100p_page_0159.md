If \( \mu_{P}<\mu_{S} \), the UE counts PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs that the UE monitors for scheduling on the primary cell from the secondary cell towards \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot } \mu_{P}} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot } \mu_{P}} \), respectively.

For allocation of PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs to search space sets for scheduling on the primary cell from the primary cell, the UE applies the procedure in clause 10.1 using \( \left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right)\right\rfloor \) instead of \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot }, \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu}\right) \), and using \( \left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu}\right)\right\rfloor \) instead of \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) for the primary cell.
10.2 PDCCH validation for DL SPS and UL grant Type 2

A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a DL SPS assignment PDCCH or a configured UL grant Type 2 PDCCH if
- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format is scrambled with a CS-RNTI provided by \( c s \)-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI provided by g-cs-RNTI, and
- the new data indicator field in the DCI format for the enabled transport block is set to ' 0 ', and
- the DFI flag field, if present, in the DCI format is set to ' 0 ', and
- the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format indicates a row with single SLIV, and
- if validation is for scheduling activation and if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format is present, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field does not provide an inapplicable value from dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16.

If a UE is provided a single configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for SPS PDSCH, validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI format are set according to Table 10.2-1 or Table 10.2-2.

If a UE is provided more than one configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for SPS PDSCH, a value of the HARQ process number field in a DCI format indicates an activation for a corresponding UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for a SPS PDSCH configuration with a same value as provided by ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex or by sps-ConfigIndex, respectively. Validation of the DCI format is achieved if the RV field for the DCI format is set as in Table 10.2-3.

If a UE is provided more than one configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for SPS PDSCH
- if the UE is provided ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList or sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList, a value of the HARQ process number field in a DCI format indicates a corresponding entry for scheduling release of one or more UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or SPS PDSCH configurations
- if the UE is not provided ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList or spsConfigDeactivationStateList, a value of the HARQ process number field in a DCI format indicates a release for a corresponding UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for a SPS PDSCH configuration with a same value as provided by ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex or by sps-ConfigIndex, respectively

Validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI format are set according to Table 10.2-4.
If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format as a valid activation or valid release of DL SPS or configured UL grant Type 2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the information in the DCI format.
