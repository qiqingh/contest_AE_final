ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

information associated with multicast DCI formats or multicast PDSCH receptions is referred to as multicast HARQACK information.

A UE can be provided one or more G-RNTIs per serving cell for scrambling the CRC of multicast DCI formats for scheduling PDSCH receptions. The UE can be provided one or more G-CS-RNTI per serving cell for scrambling the CRC of multicast DCI formats providing activation/release for SPS PDSCH receptions.

A UE can be configured by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH an MBS frequency resource for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions providing MCCH and MTCH [12, TS 38.331]; otherwise, the MBS frequency resource is same as for the CORESET with index 0 that is associated with the Type0-PDCCH CSS set for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions providing MCCH and MTCH. A UE monitors PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH receptions for MCCH or MTCH as described in clause 10.1.

In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon or PDSCH-ConfigCommon, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for MCCH/MTCH PDCCH receptions or PDSCH receptions, respectively, is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].

A UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs for MCCH or MTCH on two serving cells. A UE in the RRC_IDLE state or in the RRC_INACTIVE state is not required to simultaneously receive on a serving cell
- PDSCHs for MCCH and MTCH, or
- more than one MTCH PDSCHs, or
- PDSCH for MTCH and PBCH, or
- PDSCH for MCCH or MTCH and PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI or by P-RNTI

A UE can be configured, per DL BWP by cfr-Config-Multicast, an MBS frequency resource within the DL BWP for PDCCH and PDSCH receptions [4, TS 38.211]. If cfr-Config-Multicast does not include locationAndBandwidthMulticast, the MBS frequency resource is the active DL BWP. The UE is not required to simultaneously receive PDSCHs on two serving cells. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by PDCCH-Config or PDSCH-Config or SPS-Config for a DL BWP, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for multicast PDCCH, PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].

In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by a first or second \( P U C C H \)-Config, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast PDCCH or PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN or SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for PUCCH transmissions associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331]. In clauses referring to a higher layer parameter value provided by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook or pdsch-HARQ-ACKCodebookList, when applicable a corresponding higher layer parameter value for HARQ-ACK codebooks associated with multicast HARQ-ACK information is provided as described in [12, TS 38.331].

A UE monitors PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH receptions or for activation/release of SPS PDSCH receptions for a corresponding SPS PDSCH configuration as described in clause 10.1.

A UE can be configured by harq-Feedback-Option-Multicast for a G-RNTI, or by sps-HARQ-Feedback-OptionMulticast for a G-CS-RNTI, to provide HARQ-ACK information for a transport block reception associated with the GRNTI or with the G-CS-RNTI, respectively, according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode or according to the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode. The UE determines a priority for a PUCCH transmission with multicast HARQACK information according to any HARQ-ACK reporting mode as described in clause 9 for a PUCCH transmission with unicast HARQ-ACK information.

For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with ACK value when a UE correctly decodes a transport block or detects a DCI format indicating an SPS PDSCH release; otherwise, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with NACK value, as described in clauses 9 and 9.1 through 9.3.

For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH that would include only HARQ-ACK information with ACK values. The second HARQ-ACK reporting mode is not applicable when a number of HARQACK information bits is more than four, or for the first SPS PDSCH reception after activation of SPS PDSCH receptions for a SPS configuration, or for DCI formats having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception.
