- otherwise, the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for a reference PUSCH transmission associated with the second RS resource index \( q_{d} \)
- otherwise, if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for a reference PUSCH transmission associated with the first RS resource index \( q_{d} \), the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for a reference PUSCH transmission associated with the second RS resource index \( q_{d} \)
7.7.2 Type 2 PH report

This clause is reserved.
7.7.3 Type 3 PH report

If a UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an activated serving cell is based on an actual SRS transmission then, for SRS transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and the resource for the SRS transmission is provided by SRS-Resource, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report as
\[
\begin{array}{c}
P H_{\mathrm{type} 3, b, f, c}\left(i, q_{s}\right)=P_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f, c}(i)-\left\{P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}(i)\right)+\alpha_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \cdot P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+h_{b, f, c}(i)\right\} \\
{[\mathrm{dB}]}
\end{array}
\]
where \( P_{\text {CMAX, }, c}(i), P_{\text {osRs, }_{1} b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right), M_{\text {SRS, } b, f, c}(i), \alpha_{\text {SRS, } b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right), P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) and \( h_{b, f, c}(i) \) are defined in clause 7.3.1 with corresponding values provided by SRS-ResourceSet.

If the UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an activated serving cell is based on a reference SRS transmission then, for SRS transmission occasion \( i \) on UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), and if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and a resource for the reference SRS transmission is provided by SRS-Resource, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report as
\[
P H_{\text {type } 3, b, f, c}\left(i, q_{s}\right)=\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}_{s}, c}(i)-\left\{P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{SRSS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right)+\alpha_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \cdot P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+h_{b, f, c}(i)\right\} \quad[\mathrm{dB}]
\]
where \( q_{s} \) is an SRS resource set corresponding to SRS-ResourceSetld \( =0 \) for UL BWP \( b \) and \( P_{0 \_ \text {SRSb, }, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \), \( \alpha_{\mathrm{SRS}, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right), P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) and \( h_{b, f, c}(i) \) are defined in clause 7.3 .1 with corresponding values obtained from \( S R S \) ResourceSetld \( =0 \) for UL BWP \( b . \widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f, c}(i) \) is computed assuming \( \mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB}, \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB}, \mathrm{P}-\mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB} \) and \( \Delta \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}=0 \mathrm{~dB} \). MPR, A-MPR, P-MPR and \( \Delta \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}} \) are defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3].

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE determines a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a reference SRS transmission and a resource for the reference SRS is provided by SRSResource, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference SRS transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference SRS transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.

8 Random access procedure
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives from higher layers a set of SS/PBCH block indexes and provides to higher layers a corresponding set of RSRP measurements.

Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 may receive from higher layers an indication to perform a Type-1 random access procedure, as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.4, or a Type-2 random access procedure as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.2A.

Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives the following information from the higher layers:
