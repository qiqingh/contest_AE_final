\( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells, } 15}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \), if a UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided both monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl 6monitoringcapability.

If a UE
- is configured with \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}+N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells for which the UE is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig, or is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability and is not provided coresetPoollndex,
- with associated PDCCH candidates monitored in the active DL BWPs of the scheduling cell(s) using SCS configuration \( \mu \), where \( \sum_{\mu=0}^{3}\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}\right)>N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \), and
- a DL BWP of an activated cell is the active DL BWP of the activated cell, and a DL BWP of a deactivated cell is the DL BWP with index provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id for the deactivated cell,
the UE is not required to monitor more than \( M_{\mathrm{PDCCH}}^{\mathrm{total}, \mathrm{slot}, \mu}=\left\lfloor N_{\mathrm{cell} \mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{cap}} \cdot M_{\mathrm{PDCCH}}^{\mathrm{max}, \mathrm{slot}, \mu}\right. \).
\( \left.\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}\right) / \sum_{j=0}^{3}\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}\right)\right] \mathrm{PDCCH} \) candidates or more than \( C_{\mathrm{PDCCH}}^{\text {total, } \mathrm{slot}, \mu}= \left\lfloor N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \cdot C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s \text { lot, } \mu} \cdot\left(N_{\text {cells, } 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells, }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}\right) / \sum_{j=0}^{3}\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells, }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}\right)\right\rfloor \) non-overlapped CCEs per slot on the active DL BWP(s) of scheduling cell(s) from the \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}+N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells. \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r} 15}^{\text {cap-rl } 6} \) if a UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided both monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoring capability and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoring capability.

For each scheduled cell from the \( N_{\text {cell }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL} \mu} \) downlink cells, the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \) of the scheduling cell more than \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max }, \text { slot }, \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, }, \mu l+\mu}\right) \) PDCCH candidates or more than \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {tmax, slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) non-overlapped CCEs per slot.

For each scheduled cell from the \( N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL} \mu} \) downlink cells, the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \) of the scheduling cell
- more than \( \min \left(\gamma \cdot M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) PDCCH candidates or more than \( \min \left(\gamma \cdot C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } \text { slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) nonoverlapped CCEs per slot
- more than \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) PDCCH candidates or more than \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) nonoverlapped CCEs per slot for CORESETs with same coresetPoollndex value
