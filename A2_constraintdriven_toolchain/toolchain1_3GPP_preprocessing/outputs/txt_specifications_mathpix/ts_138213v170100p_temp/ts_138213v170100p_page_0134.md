When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than 2 cells, or for a cell group when the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to monitor per span a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \).

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}}^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { cells }} \) downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG and the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl 6monitoringcapability for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE expects to be provided pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG and pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG with values that satisfy
- pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG <= pdcch-MonitoringCA, if the UE reports pdcch-MonitoringCA, or
- pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG \( <=N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}}^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { cells }} \), if the UE does not report pdcch-MonitoringCA

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation and the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE may indicate, through pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16 and pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16, respective maximum values for pdcchBlindDetection for the MCG and pdcch-BlindDetection for the SCG.

If the UE reports pdcch-MonitoringCA,
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16 or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16 is [1, ...,pdcchMonitoring CA-1], and
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16+pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16>=pdcch-MonitoringCA.

Otherwise, if \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \text { max, r16 }}^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { clls }} \) is a maximum total number of downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability and the UE is configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in UE-NR-Capability
- the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16 or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16 is 1,
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16+pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16>= \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \max , \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL} 601 \mathrm{c}} \)

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than four downlink cells, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of nonoverlapped CCEs that the UE can monitor per group of \( X_{s} \) slots when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than four downlink cells with SCS configuration \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \). When a UE is not configured for NRDC operation for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per group of \( X_{s} \) slots that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) downlink cells, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-MonitoringCA-r17
- otherwise, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is the value of pdcch-MonitoringCA-r17

When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells, the UE does not expect to monitor per group of \( X_{s} \) slots a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \).

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability or larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoringcapability, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability or for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability and at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of
