- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after a slot where the timer expires or after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \)
- at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after a slot where the timer expires or after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)

If a UE is not provided SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger for a serving cell,
- if the UE detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH according to a search space set with group index 0 , the UE starts monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1 , and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0 , for the serving cell
- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \),
- at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)
the UE sets the timer value to the value provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer if the UE detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH in any search space set
- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space sets with group index 1 , the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving cell according to search space sets with group index 0 , and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1 , for the serving cell
- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after a slot where the timer expires or, if the UE is provided a search space set to monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \), after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in \{0,1,2,3\} \)
- at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after a slot where the timer expires or, if the UE is provided a search space set to monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \), after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)

A UE determines a slot and a symbol in the slot to start or stop PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets for a serving cell that the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupldList or, if cellGroupsForSwitchList is provided, for a set of serving cells, based on the smallest SCS configuration \( \mu \) among all configured DL BWPs in the serving cell or in the set of serving cells and, if any, in the serving cell where the UE receives a PDCCH and detects a corresponding DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) triggering the start or stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets.

A UE can be provided a set of durations by PDCCHSkippingDurationList for PDCCH monitoring on an active DL BWP of a serving cell and, if the UE is not provided searchSpaceGroupIdList-r 17 on the active DL BWP of the serving cell, a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and a DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) that schedule PUSCH transmission, and a DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) and a DCI format 1 _ 2 that schedule PDSCH receptions can include a PDCCH monitoring adaptation field of 1 bit or of 2 bits.

If the field has 1 bit and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell
- a ' 0 ' value for the bit indicates no skipping in PDCCH monitoring
- a '1' value for the bit indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the first value in the set of durations

If the field has 2 bits and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell
- a ' 00 ' value for the bits indicates no skipping in PDCCH monitoring
- a '01' value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the first value in the set of durations
