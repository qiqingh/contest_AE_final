\( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=1 \) and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or \( \mu_{r} \), where \( \mu_{r} \) corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15 kHz or higher; otherwise \( \mu_{r}=0 \).

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS or detects a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) indicating to the UE to receive a CSI-RS in one or more RB sets and a set of symbols of a slot, and the UE detects a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) with bitmap indicating that any RB set from the one or more RB sets is not available for reception, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot.

A UE assumes that flexible symbols in a CORESET configured to the UE for PDCCH monitoring are downlink symbols if the UE does not detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as flexible or uplink and the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to transmit SRS, PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated if provided, or when tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated are not provided to the UE, and if the UE does not detect a DCI format \( 2-0 \) providing a slot format for the slot
- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format
- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR
- the UE receives PDCCH as described in clause 10.1
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDSCH in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the set of symbols of the slot
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot, except when UE is provided CO-DurationsPerCell and the set of symbols of the slot are within the remaining channel occupancy duration.
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the DL PRS
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is not provided enableConfiguredUL, then
- if the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in the slot if the first symbol of the PUCCH or the PUSCH or actual repetition of the PUSCH or the PRACH in the slot occurs within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in the slot;
- if the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9 and 9.25 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols;
- the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0. The UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols;
- \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=1 \) and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of
