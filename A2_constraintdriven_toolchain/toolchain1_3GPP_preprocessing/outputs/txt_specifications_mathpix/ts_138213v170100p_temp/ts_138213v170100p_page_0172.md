For a UE operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or in FR2-2 when the UE is provided ChannelAccessMode2-r17 = 'enabled', if the UE is provided csi-RS-ValidationWith-DCI, is not provided CODurationsPerCell, and is not provided SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell, and if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating an aperiodic CSI-RS reception or scheduling a PDSCH reception in the set of symbols of the slot.

If a UE is provided channelAccessMode = 'dynamic' and is provided availableRB-SetsToAddModList and availableRBSetsToReleaseList, the UE expects to be provided co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList and coDurationsPerCellToReleaseList and/or slotFormatCombToAddModList and slotFormatCombToReleaseList.

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols, then
- If the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS38.214], determined from clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS38.214], or the PRACH transmission in the set of symbols.
- If the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within \( T_{p r o c, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9 and 9.2 .5 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols.
- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from the subset of symbols that occur within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
\( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=1 \) and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or \( \mu_{r} \), where \( \mu_{r} \) corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15 kHz or higher; otherwise \( \mu_{r}=0 \).

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS when the PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, if the UE is not provided with a measurement gap.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS when the PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, the UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher layer parameters configuring transmission from the UE in the set of symbols of the slot and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring reception by the UE in the set of symbols of the slot.

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, for a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE for reception of SS/PBCH blocks by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBl or by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon or, if the UE is not provided DLorJoint-TCIState or followUnifiedTCIstate, by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI associated to physical cell ID with active TCI states, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH in the slot if a transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols and the UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot. The UE does not expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, when provided to the UE.
