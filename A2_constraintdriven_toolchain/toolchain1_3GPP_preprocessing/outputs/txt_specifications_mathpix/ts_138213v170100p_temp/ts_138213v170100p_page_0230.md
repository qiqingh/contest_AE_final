If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1, with the following modifications:
- For the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 16.5.2.1, after the completion of the \( m \) loop, the UE sets \( V_{\text {temp }}=V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{SAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) where \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{SAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) is the value of the SAI field in the DCI format according to Table 16.5.2.2-1.

If a UE
- is scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by a DCI format that includes a SAI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{SAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}}=4 \), and
- has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions on a serving cell, and
- does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH reception occasions associated with a SL configured grant to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause 16.5.2.1,
the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline SAI MSB, LSB & \( \boldsymbol{V}_{\text {T-SAI }}^{\text {UL }} \) & Number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in which DCI format 3_0 scheduling PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions is present, denoted as \( X \) and \( X \geq 1 \) \\
\hline 0,0 & 1 & \( (X-1) \bmod 4+1=1 \) \\
\hline 0,1 & 2 & \( (X-1) \bmod 4+1=2 \) \\

16.6 UE procedure for LTE sidelink transmission

If the UE detects a DCI format 31 with CRC scrambled by SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI in slot \( n \), the DCI format 3_1 activates or releases an LTE sidelink SPS configuration that is indicated by a SL SPS configuration index field [5, TS 38.212]. If the DCI format 3_1 activates an SL SPS configuration, the UE procedure for transmitting a PSCCH and a PSSCH is as described in [13, TS 36.213] except that a transmission starts no earlier than \( T_{D C I}-\frac{N_{\text {TA }}}{2} \times T_{\mathrm{C}} \times 10^{3}+X+(4+m) \mathrm{ms} \), where \( T_{D C I} \) is a start time of slot \( n, N_{T A} \) and \( T_{C} \) are defined in \( [4, \mathrm{TS} 38.211], X \) is a value indicated by a Timing offset field in DCI format \( 3 \_1 \), and \( m \) is a value indicated by SL index field in DCI format \( 3 \_1 \) if the SL index field is present; otherwise, \( m=0 \).
16.7 Operation for in-device coexistence

If a UE would transmit or receive a first channel/signal using E-UTRA radio access and a second channel/signal using NR radio access, when
- the first channel/signal and the second channel/signal are time-division multiplexed, and
- the UE knows the frame indexes of the first channel/signal and the frame indexes of the second channel/signal,
the UE transmits or receives each channel/signal so that the subframe boundary of the second channel/signal is aligned with the subframe boundary of the first channel/signal where the subframe boundary alignment is achieved by UE implementation means.

17 UE with reduced capabilities
A UE with reduced capabilities (RedCap UE) supports all Layer-1 UE features that are mandatory without capability signalling.
