ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

If a UE would transmit \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs in a PSFCH transmission occasion, the UE first transmits PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information from \( N_{\text {Tx }, \text { PSF CH }} \) PSFCHs corresponding to the smallest priority field values from the \( N_{\text {Tx PSFCH }} \) priority field values. Subsequently, the UE transmits remaining PSFCHs with conflict information corresponding to the smallest remaining priority field values from the \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}, \mathrm{PSFCH}} \) priority field values, if any.

If a UE indicates a capability to receive \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}, \mathrm{PSFCH}} \mathrm{PSFCHs} \) in a PSFCH reception occasion [18, TS 38.306], the UE first receives PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information, if any, and subsequently receives PSFCHs with conflict information, if any.
16.2.4.3 Simultaneous SL and UL transmissions/receptions

If a UE
- would simultaneously transmit on the UL and on the SL in a carrier or in two respective carriers, and
- the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmissions on the UL and on the SL in the carrier or in the two respective carriers
the UE transmits only on the link, UL or SL, with the higher priority.
If a UE
- would simultaneously transmit on the UL and receive on the SL in a carrier, or
- would simultaneously transmit on the UL and receive on the SL in two respective carriers and the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission on the UL and reception on the SL in the two respective carriers
the UE transmits on UL or receives on SL, with the higher priority.
If a UE
- is capable of simultaneous transmissions on the UL and on the SL in two respective carriers,
- would transmit on the UL and on the SL in the two respective carriers,
- the transmission on the UL would overlap with the transmission on the SL over a time period, and
- the total UE transmission power over the time period would exceed \( P_{\text {CMAX }} \)
the UE
- reduces the power for the UL transmission prior to the start of the UL transmission, if the SL transmission has higher priority than the UL transmission as determined in clause 16.2.4.3.1, so that the total UE transmission power would not exceed \( P_{\text {CMAX }} \)
- reduces the power for the SL transmission prior to the start of the SL transmission, if the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission as determined in clause 16.2.4.3.1, so that the total UE transmission power would not exceed \( P_{\text {CMAX }} \)
16.2.4.3.1 Prioritizations for sidelink and uplink transmissions/receptions

A UE performs prioritization between SL transmissions/receptions and UL transmissions after performing the procedures described in clause 9, clause 9.2.5, and clause 9.2.6, and in clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214].

PSFCH transmissions in a slot, as determined in clause 16.2.4.2, have a same priority value as the smallest priority value among PSSCH receptions with corresponding HARQ-ACK information provided by the PSFCH transmissions in the slot, if any, and among PSFCH transmissions with conflict information in the slot, if any, where each priority value is equal to the smallest priority value determined by corresponding SCI formats \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) as described in clause 16.3.

PSFCH receptions in a slot, as determined in clause 16.2.4.2, have a same priority value as the smallest priority value among PSSCH transmissions with corresponding HARQ-ACK information provided by the PSFCH receptions in the slot, if any, and among PSFCH receptions with conflict information in the slot, if any, where each priority value is equal to the priority value determined by corresponding SCI format 1-A as described in clause 16.3.

A priority of S-SS/PSBCH block transmission or reception is provided by sl-SSB-PriorityNR.
