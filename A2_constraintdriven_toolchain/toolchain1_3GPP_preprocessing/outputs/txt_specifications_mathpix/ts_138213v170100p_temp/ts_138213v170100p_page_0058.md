If uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH is provided by BWP-UplinkCommon or BWP-UplinkDedicated, the frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource allocation type 2 [6, TS 38.214]. A UE processes the frequency domain resource assignment field as follows
- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to the \( X=6 \mathrm{LSBs} \) if \( \mu=0 \), or to the \( X=5 \mathrm{LSBs} \) if \( \mu=1 \)
- for interlace allocation of a PUSCH transmission, interpret the X MSBs of the truncated frequency domain resource assignment field for the active UL BWP as for the X MSBs of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format \( 0 \_0[6 \), TS 38.214]
- for RB set allocation of a PUSCH transmission, the RB set of the active UL BWP is the RB set of the PRACH transmission associated with the RAR UL grant. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsUL-List [6, TS 38.214].

A UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding as described in [6, TS 38.214].
For a PUSCH transmission with frequency hopping scheduled by RAR UL grant or for a Msg3 PUSCH retransmission, the frequency offset for the second hop [6, TS 38.214] is given in Table 8.3-1.

A SCS for the PUSCH transmission is provided by subcarrierSpacing in BWP-UplinkCommon. A UE transmits PRACH and the PUSCH on a same uplink carrier of a same serving cell.

A UE transmits a transport block in a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant in a corresponding RAR message using redundancy version number 0 , if the PUSCH transmission is without repetitions. If a TC-RNTI is provided by higher layers, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by TC-RNTI. Otherwise, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by C-RNTI.

Msg3 PUSCH retransmissions, if any, of the transport block, are scheduled by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321].

With reference to slots for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, if a UE receives a PDSCH with a RAR message ending in slot \( n \) for a corresponding PRACH transmission from the UE, the UE transmits the PUSCH in slot \( n+k_{2}+\Delta+2^{\mu} \cdot K_{\text {cell, offset, }} \) where \( k_{2} \) and \( \Delta \) are provided in \( [6, \mathrm{TS} 38.214] \) and \( K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) is provided by CellSpecific_Koffset; otherwise, if not provided, \( K_{\text {cell }, \text { offset }}=0 \).

A UE can be provided in RACH-ConfigCommon a set of numbers of repetitions for a PUSCH transmission with PUSCH repetition Type A that is scheduled by a RAR UL grant or by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a TCRNTI. If the UE requests repetitions for the PUSCH transmission [11, TS 38.321], the UE transmits the PUSCH over \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots, where \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) from a set of four values provided by numberOfMsg3Repetitions or from \( \{1,2,3,4\} \) if numberOfMsg3Repetitions is not provided. The UE determines an MCS for the PUSCH transmission by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format \( 0 \_0 \), and determines a redundancy version and RBs for each repetition as described in [6, TS 38.214]. For unpaired spectrum operation, the UE determines the \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots as the first \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots starting from slot \( n+k_{2}+\Delta \) where a repetition of the PUSCH transmission does not include a symbol
