- if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 1 ', the UE determines two values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE pusch }, b, f, c}(j) \) from first values in P0-PUSCH-Set in P0-PUSCH-SetList and P0-PUSCH-Set in P0-PUSCH-SetList2 with p0-PUSCH-Setld values mapped to the two SRI values corresponding to each SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook', respectively.
- if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and an open-loop power control parameter set indication field and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook',
- if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 0 ', the UE determines two values of \( P_{0_{-} u e \text { pusch }, b_{1}, f, c}(j) \) from the p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld values in SRI-PUSCHPowerControl that are mapped to the first SRI field value corresponding to the first SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook' and to a second value, that is associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, corresponding to the second SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook'.
- if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 1 ', the UE determines two values of \( P_{0} \) ue pusch \( , b, f, c \) j from first values in P0-PUSCH-Set in P0-PUSCH-SetList and P0-PUSCH-Set in P0-PUSCH-SetList2 with p0-PUSCH-Setld values mapped to the first SRI field value corresponding to the first SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook, and a second value, that is associated with the second SRS field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.228/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, corresponding to the second SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook', respectively.
- If the UE is not provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and if the PUSCH transmission, except for the PUSCH retransmission corresponding to a RAR UL grant, is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, or if SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl is not provided to the UE, \( j=2 \),
- If P0-PUSCH-Set is provided to the UE and the DCI format includes an open-loop power control parameter set indication field, the UE determines a value of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) from
- a first P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 0 ' or ' 00 '
- a first value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest \( p 0-P U S C H-S e t I D \) value if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 1 ' or ' 01 '
- a second value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest \( p 0-P U S C H-S e t I D \) value if a value of the openloop power control parameter set indication field is ' 10 '
- else, the UE determines \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PusCH, } b+} f_{c}(j) \) from the value of the first P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in \( p 0 \) AlphaSets
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field and includes an SRS resource set indicator field with value 10 or 11
- If P0-PUSCH-Set is provided to the UE and the DCI format includes an open-loop power control parameter set indication field, the UE determines first and second values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUSCH, } b, f, c}(j) \) as
- first and second P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets if the open-loop power control parameter set indication value is ' 0 ' or ' 00 '
- first value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest p0-PUSCH-SetID value in p0-PUSCH-SetList and first value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest p0-PUSCH-SetID value in p0-PUSCH-SetList2, respectively, if the open-loop power control parameter set indication value is ' 1 ' or ' 01 '
