When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation and is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability for at least one downlink cell and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for at least one downlink cell where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs that corresponds to

When a UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability, at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability, and no downlink cell has SCS configuration \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \), or for a cell group when the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to
- monitor per slot a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r} 15}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \), and
- monitor per span a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells,r16 }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \)
