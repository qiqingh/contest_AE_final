- PUCCH format 4 if
- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,
- the PUCCH resource includes an orthogonal cover code and the UE is not provided uselnterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated

A spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission by a UE is provided by
- an indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIstate, if provided, as described in [6, TS 38.214];
- PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo if the UE is configured with a single value for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold;
- as described in [11, TS 38.321], if the UE is provided multiple values for PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo. The UE applies corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] and a corresponding setting for a spatial domain filter to transmit PUCCH in the first slot that is after slot \( k+3 \cdot N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subfame }, \mu} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information with ACK value corresponding to a PDSCH reception providing the PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, each slot consists of \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) symbols as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH
- If PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides ssb-Index, the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-Index for a same serving cell or, if servingCellld is provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld
- else if PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides csi-RS-Index, or the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState provides csi-rs configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a CSI-RS with resource index provided by csi-RSIndex or csi-rs for a same serving cell or, if servingCellld or cell is provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld or cell
- else PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or the indicated UL-TCIstate provides srs, the UE transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a transmission of a SRS with resource index provided by resource for a same serving cell and/or active UL BWP or, if servingCellld and/or uplinkBWP are provided, for a serving cell indicated by servingCellld and/or for an UL BWP indicated by uplinkBWP

If a UE
- is not provided pathlossReferenceRSs in PUCCH-PowerControl,
- is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH, and
- is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, and
- is not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any CORESET, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for all CORESETs, in ControlResourceSet and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212]
a spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission from the UE is same as a spatial setting for PDCCH receptions by the UE in the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the PCell and, if the CORESET has two activated TCI states as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the spatial setting for the PUCCH transmission based on the first TCI state. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a same spatial setting applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple slots.

A number of DMRS symbols for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is provided by additionalDMRS.
Use of \( \pi / 2 \)-BPSK, instead of QPSK, for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is indicated by pi2BPSK.
9.2.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK

In this clause, for the purpose of determining a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission in a slot using a PUCCH resource indicator field in a DCI format that schedules a PDSCH reception, and for the purpose of determining the slot for the PUCCH transmission, a UE is assumed to generate HARQ-ACK information regardless of whether or not the
