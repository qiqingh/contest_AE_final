- \( \Delta_{\text {BWPSwitching }}=0 \) if the active UL BWP does not change and \( \Delta_{\text {BWPSwitching }} \) is defined in [10, TS 38.133] otherwise
- \( \Delta_{\text {Delay }}=0.5 \mathrm{msec} \) for FR1 and \( \Delta_{\text {Delay }}=0.25 \mathrm{msec} \) for FR2
- \( T_{\text {switch }} \) is a switching gap duration as defined in [6, TS 38.214]

For a PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS , the UE determines \( N_{2} \) assuming SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \).
For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in a same slot or when a gap between the first or last symbol of a PRACH transmission in a first slot is separated by less than \( N \) symbols from the last or first symbol, respectively, of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission in a second slot where \( N=2 \) for \( \mu=0 \) or \( \mu=1, N=4 \) for \( \mu=2 \) or \( \mu=3, N= \) 16 for \( \mu=5, N=32 \) for \( \mu=6 \), and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the active UL BWP. For a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type B, this applies to each actual repetition for PUSCH transmission [6, TS 38.214].
8.1A PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure

For a Type-2 random access procedure, a UE transmits a PUSCH, when applicable, after transmitting a PRACH. The UE encodes a transport block provided for the PUSCH transmission using redundancy version number 0 . The PUSCH transmission is after the PRACH transmission by at least \( N \) symbols where \( N=2 \) for \( \mu=0 \) or \( \mu=1, N=4 \) for \( \mu=2 \) or \( \mu=3, N=16 \) for \( \mu=5, N=32 \) for \( \mu=6 \), and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the active UL BWP.

A UE does not transmit a PUSCH in a PUSCH occasion if the PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource is not mapped to a preamble of valid PRACH occasions or if the associated PRACH preamble is not transmitted as described in clause 7.5 or clause 11.1. A UE can transmit a PRACH preamble in a valid PRACH occasion if the PRACH preamble is not mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion.

A mapping between one or multiple PRACH preambles and a PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource is per PUSCH configuration.

A UE determines time resources and frequency resources for PUSCH occasions in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-Config for the active UL BWP. If the active UL BWP is not the initial UL BWP and msgA-PUSCH-Config is not provided for the active UL BWP, the UE uses the msgA-PUSCH-Config provided for the initial UL BWP.

A UE determines a first interlace or first RB for a first PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP respectively from interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH or from frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH that provides an offset, in number of RBs in the active UL BWP, from a first RB of the active UL BWP. A PUSCH occasion includes a number of interlaces or a number of RBs provided by nrofInterlacesPerMsgA-PO or by nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO, respectively. Consecutive PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL BWP are separated by a number of RBs provided by guardBandMsgA-PUSCH. A number \( N_{f} \) of PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL BWP is provided by nrofMsgA-PO-FDM.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion is provided by higher layer parameters frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH and nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO, the UE expects a PUSCH occasion to be confined within the same RB set as the corresponding PRACH transmission.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion is provided by higher layer parameters interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH and nroflnterlacesPerMsgA-PO, the RB set for the PUSCH occasion in the active UL BWP is the same RB set as the corresponding PRACH transmission. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214].

If a UE does not have dedicated RRC configuration, or has an initial UL BWP as an active UL BWP, or is not provided startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation provides a SLIV and a PUSCH mapping type for a PUSCH transmission by indicating
- one of the first maxNrofUL-Allocations values from PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList, if PUSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocationList is provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon
- one of the entries from table 6.1.2.1.1-2 or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 in [6, TS 38.214], if PUSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocationList is not provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon
