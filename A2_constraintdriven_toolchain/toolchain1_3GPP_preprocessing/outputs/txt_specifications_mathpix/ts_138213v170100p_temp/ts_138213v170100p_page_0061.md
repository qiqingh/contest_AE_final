- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the first PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in any PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the first PUCCH-Config
- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the second PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 1 in any PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the second PUCCH-Config

If a UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in a PUCCH-Config of a given priority index, in a slot of \( N_{\text {sym }}^{\text {slot }} \) symbols [4, TS 38.211 ] with HARQ-ACK, the UE does not expect that HARQ-ACK information in response to SPS PDSCH reception(s) only (if any) or SR (if any) of the given priority index in a slot of subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols is moved to a different slot of subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols after multiplexing overlapping PUCCHs.

If in an active \( \mathrm{DL} B W P \) a UE monitors PDCCH for detection of DCI format that includes a priority indicator field, a priority index can be provided by the priority indicator field. If a UE indicates a capability to monitor, in an active DL BWP, PDCCH for detection of DCI format that includes a priority indicator field, the DCI format can schedule a PUSCH transmission of any priority, or a PDSCH reception and/or trigger a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information of any priority, and DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) can indicate a TCI state update and trigger a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information of any priority.

A DCI format indicating a SPS PDSCH release, or SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception, or indicating a TCI state update without scheduling PDSCH reception, is referred to as a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUCCH of larger and/or smaller priority index, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUCCH of each priority index as described in clause 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 before resolving the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions without SL HARQ-ACK or the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions and PUSCH transmissions.

If a UE
- is provided simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH and would transmit a PUCCH with a first priority index and PUSCHs with a second priority index that is different than the first priority index, where the PUCCH and the PUSCHs overlap in time
- can simultaneously transmit the PUCCH and the PUSCHs [16, TS 38.306],
the UE excludes the PUSCHs for resolving the time overlapping between the PUCCH and PUSCHs, where the timeline conditions are not required for the excluded PUSCHs.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of different priority indexes other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports before considering limitations for UE transmission as described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1, including repetitions if any, if the UE is provided UCI-MuxWithDifferentPriority and the timeline conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing UCI in a PUCCH or a PUSCH are satisfied
- first, the UE resolves overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of a same priority index as described in clauses 9.2.5 and 9.2.6
- second, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions of different priority indexes, and
- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the second PUCCH-Config, a PUCCH transmission of smaller priority index is associated with the first overlapping slot with subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols of larger priority index; otherwise, the PUCCH transmission of smaller priority index is associated with the overlapping slot with \( N_{\text {sym }}^{\text {slot }} \) symbols [4, TS 38.211] of larger priority index.
- the UE first resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions, where at least one of the PUCCH transmissions is with \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) repetitions, within a slot of larger priority index as is subsequently described in this clause, if any, and then the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions without repetitions within the slot using the pseudo-code in clause 9.2.5
- if the UE determines that a first PUCCH transmission of the smaller priority index is not dropped and the UCI of the first PUCCH transmission is not multiplexed in a second PUCCH transmission of larger priority index in an overlapping slot with subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols, the first PUCCH transmission is
