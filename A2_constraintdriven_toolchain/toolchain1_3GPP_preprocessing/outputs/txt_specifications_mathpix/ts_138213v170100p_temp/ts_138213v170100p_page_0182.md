the PDCCH carrying the DCI format \( 2-0 \) and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or \( \mu_{r} \), where \( \mu_{r} \) corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15 kHz or higher; otherwise \( \mu_{r}=0 \);
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is provided enableConfiguredUL, the UE can transmit the SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH, respectively.

For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a cell in a frequency band of FR1, and when the scheduling restrictions due to RRM measurements [10, TS 38.133 ] are not applicable, if the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to transmit in a set of symbols, the UE is not required to perform RRM measurements [10, TS 38.133] based on a SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception on a different cell in the frequency band if the SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception includes at least one symbol from the set of symbols.
11.2 Interrupted transmission indication

If a UE is provided DownlinkPreemption, the UE is configured with an [NT-RNT] provided by int-RNTI for monitoring PDCCH conveying DCI format 2_1 [5, TS 38.212]. The UE is additionally configured with
- a set of serving cells by int-ConfigurationPerServingCell that includes a set of serving cell indexes provided by corresponding servingCellld and a corresponding set of locations for fields in DCI format 2 _ 1 by positionInDCI
- an information payload size for DCI format 2 _ 1 by dci-PayloadSize
- an indication granularity for time-frequency resources by timeFrequencySet

If a UE detects a DCI format 2_1 for a serving cell from the configured set of serving cells, the UE may assume that no transmission to the UE is present in PRBs and in symbols that are indicated by the DCI format 2 , from a set of PRBs and a set of symbols of the last monitoring period. The indication by the DCI format 2 _ 1 is not applicable to receptions of SS/PBCH blocks.

The set of PRBs is equal to the active DL BWP as defined in clause 12 and includes \( B_{\text {INT }} \) PRBs.
If a UE detects a DCI format \( 2 \_1 \) in a PDCCH reception in a slot, the set of symbols is the last \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slet }} \cdot T_{\text {INT }} \cdot 2^{\mu-\rho_{\text {IMT }}} \) symbols prior to the first symbol of the PDCCH reception in the slot where \( T_{\text {INT }} \) is the PDCCH monitoring periodicity provided by the value of monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, as described in clause \( 10.1, N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) is the number of symbols per slot, \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for a serving cell with mapping to a respective field in the DCI format 2_1, \( \mu_{\text {INT }} \) is the SCS configuration of the DL BWP where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format 2_1. If the UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, symbols indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon are excluded from the last \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \cdot T_{\text {INT }} \cdot 2^{\mu-\mu_{\text {MT }}} \) symbols prior to the first symbol of the PDCCH reception in the slot. The resulting set of symbols includes a number of symbols that is denoted as \( N_{\text {INT }} \) -

The UE does not expect to be provided values of \( \mu_{,} \mu_{\text {INT }} \), and \( T_{\text {INT }} \) resulting to a value of \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \cdot T_{\text {INT }} \cdot 2^{\mu-\mu_{\text {INT }}} \) that is not an integer. The UE does not expect to be configured by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot with more than one PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2_1 in a slot.

A UE is provided the indication granularity for the set of PRBs and for the set of symbols by timeFrequencySet.
If the value of timeFrequencySet is 'set0', 14 bits from MSB of a field in DCI format 2 _ 1 have a one-to-one mapping with 14 groups of consecutive symbols from the set of symbols where each of the first \( N_{\text {INT }}-\left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 14\right\rfloor 14 \) symbol groups includes \( \left\lceil N_{\text {INT }} / 14\right\rceil \) symbols, each of the last \( 14-N_{\text {INT }}+\left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 14\right\rfloor 14 \) symbol groups includes \( \left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 14\right\rfloor \) symbols, a bit value of 0 indicates transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and a bit value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group.

If the value of timeFrequencySet is 'set1', 7 pairs of bits from MSB of a field in the DCI format 21 have a one-to-one mapping with 7 groups of consecutive symbols where each of the first \( N_{\text {INT }}-\left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 7\right\rfloor .7 \) symbol groups includes \( \left\lceil N_{\text {INT }} / 7\right\rceil \) symbols, each of the last \( 7-N_{\text {INT }}+\left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 7\right\rfloor .7 \) symbol groups includes \( \left\lfloor N_{\text {INT }} / 7\right\rfloor \) symbols, a first bit in a pair of bits for a symbol group is applicable to the subset of first \( \left\lceil B_{\text {INT }} / 2\right\rceil \) PRBs from the set of \( B_{\text {INT }} \) PRBs, a second bit in the pair of bits for the symbol group is applicable to the subset of last \( \left\lfloor B_{\text {INT }} / 2\right\rfloor \) PRBs from the set of \( B_{\text {INT }} \) PRBs,
