10.4 Search space set group switching and skipping of PDCCH monitoring

A UE can be provided a group index for a respective Type3-PDCCH CSS set or USS set by searchSpaceGroupIdList for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell. If the UE is not provided searchSpaceGroupIdList for a search space set, the following procedures are not applicable for PDOCH monitoring according to the search space set.

If a UE is provided cellGroupsForSwitchList, indicating one or more groups of serving cells, the following procedures apply to all serving cells within each group; otherwise, the following procedures apply only to a serving cell for which the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList.

When a UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList, the UE resets PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 , if provided by searchSpaceGroupIdList.

A UE can be provided by searchSpaceSwitchDelay a number of symbols \( P_{\text {switch }} \) where a minimum value of \( P_{\text {switch }} \) is provided in Table 10.4-1 for UE processing capability 1 and UE processing capability 2 and SCS configuration \( \mu \). UE processing capability 1 for SCS configuration \( \mu \) applies unless the UE indicates support for UE processing capability 2 .

A UE can be provided, by searchSpaceSwitchTimer, a timer value for a serving cell that the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList or, if provided, for a set of serving cells provided by cellGroupsForSwitchList. The UE decrements the timer value by one after each slot based on a reference SCS configuration that is the smallest SCS configuration \( \mu \) among all configured DL BWPs in the serving cell, or in the set of serving cells. The UE maintains the reference SCS configuration during the timer decrement procedure.

If a UE is provided by SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger a location of a search space set group switching flag field in a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \), as described in clause 11.1.1, for a serving cell where the UE has active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \)
- if the UE detects a DCI format 2_0 and a value of the search space set group switching flag field in the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) is 0 , the UE starts monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0 , and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1 , for the serving cell
- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \)
- at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)
- if the UE detects a DCI format 2_0 and a value of the search space set group switching flag field in the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) is 1 , the UE starts monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1 , and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0 , for the serving cell
- at the beginning of the first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \), when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \)
- at the beginning of the first slot, of a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)
and the UE sets the timer value to the value provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer
- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space sets with group index 1 , the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving cell according to search space sets with group index 0 , and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1 , for the serving cell
