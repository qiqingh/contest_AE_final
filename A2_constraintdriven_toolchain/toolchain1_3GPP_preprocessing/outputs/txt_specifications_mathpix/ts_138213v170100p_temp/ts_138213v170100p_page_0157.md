corresponding PUSCH symbol over all serving cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl 7monitoringcapability

If a UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( =r 17 \) monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, and monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, is not configured for NR-DC operation, indicates a capability to monitor PDCCH candidates for \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \geq 1 \) downlink cells, \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 /\{r 15, r 17\}}^{\text {cap- } r 17} \geq 1 \), and \( N_{\text {cell }, r 17 /\{r 15, r 16\}}^{\text {cap- } r 17} \geq 1 \) downlink cells, and is configured with \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}}>1 \) downlink cells or \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{UL}}>1 \) uplink cells
the UE expects to have respectively received
- at most \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a MCS-C-RNTI scheduling \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells, } r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any corresponding PDSCH symbol over all serving cells that are provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability

- at most \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells }, r 17 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a MCS-C-RNTI scheduling \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells, } r 17 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any corresponding PDSCH symbol over all serving cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl 7monitoringcapability

If a UE
- is configured to monitor a first PDCCH candidate for a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) from a CSS set and a second PDCCH candidate for a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) from a USS set, where the CSS set and the USS set do not include searchSpaceLinking, in a CORESET with index zero on an active DL BWP, and
- the DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 1 \_0 \) associated with the first PDCCH candidate and the DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 1 \_0 \) associated with the second PDCCH candidate have same size, and
- the UE receives the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate over a same set of CCEs, and
- the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate have identical scrambling, and
- the DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 1 \_0 \) for the first PDCCH candidate and the DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 1 \_0 \) for the second PDCCH candidate have CRC scrambled by either C-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI
the UE decodes only the DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 1 \_0 \) associated with the first PDCCH candidate.
If a UE detects a DCI format with inconsistent information, the UE discards all the information in the DCI format.
