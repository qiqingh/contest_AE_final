- For \( \mu=3 \) and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{\imath} \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 \) are provided by Table 13-12.
- For \( \mu=5 \) and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{l} \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+4 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+4 \) are provided by Table 13-12A, where \( X=1.25 \).
- For \( \mu=6 \) and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{\imath} \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+8 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+8 \) are provided by Table 13-12A, where \( X=0.625 \).

For operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over one slot with Type0-PDCCH CSS set periodicity equal to the periodicity of SS/PBCH block. For a SS/PBCH block with index \( i \), the UE determines the slot index \( n_{\mathrm{c}} \) and \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\mathrm{c}} \) based on parameters provided by Tables 13-13 through 13-15A.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 3, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable. For a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{\imath} \), where \( 0 \leq \bar{\imath} \leq \bar{L}_{\max }-1 \), the periodicity of the slot including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasion is same as the periodicity of the candidate SS/PBCH block, and the UE determines the slot index \( n_{\mathrm{c}} \) and \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\mathrm{c}} \) based on parameters provided by Tables 13-15 and 13-15A, where \( i \) is replaced by \( \bar{\imath} \) for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2.

For the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, if the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the UE is expected to be able to perform radio link monitoring, as described in clause 5, and measurements for radio resource management [10, TS 38.133] using a SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set.
