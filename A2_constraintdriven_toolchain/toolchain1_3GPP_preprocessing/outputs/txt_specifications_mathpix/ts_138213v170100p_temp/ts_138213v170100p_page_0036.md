subcarriers used for DM-RS transmission, and \( N_{\text {symb-UCI }, b_{1}, c}^{\text {PUCCH }}(i) \) is a number of symbols excluding symbols used for DM-RS transmission, as defined in clause 9.2.5.2, for PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \).
- For the PUCCH power control adjustment state \( g_{b, f, c}(i, l) \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) and PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \)
- \( \quad \delta_{\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c}(i, l) \) is a TPC command value included in a DCI format associated with the PUCCH transmission for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of the primary cell \( c \) that the UE detects for PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \), or is jointly coded with other TPC commands in a DCI format \( 2 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by TPC-PUCCHRNTI [5, TS 38.212], as described in clause 11.3
- \( l \in\{0,1\} \) if the UE is provided twoPUCCH-PC-AdjustmentStates and PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, or more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and \( l=0 \) if the UE is not provided twoPUCCH-PC-AdjustmentStates or PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, and more than one sets of power control parameters
- If the UE obtains a TPC command value from a DCI format associated with the PUCCH transmission and if the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by an index provided by p0-PUCCH-Id, between a set of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold values and a set of values for closedLoopIndex that provide the \( l \) value(s). If the UE receives an activation command indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the value closedLoopIndex that provides the value of \( l \) through the link to a corresponding p0-PUCCH-Id index
- If the UE obtains a TPC command from a DCI format 2 _ 2 with CRC scrambled by a TPC-PUCCHRNTI, the \( l \) value is provided by the closed loop indicator field in DCI format 2_2
- If the UE transmits the PUCCH with \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) repetitions, as described in clause 9.2.6, and the UE is provided twoPUCCH-PC-AdjustmentStates by pucch-PowerControl
- If the DCI format includes two TPC command values and the PUCCH resource of the PUCCH transmission is associated with \( l=0 \) and \( l=1 \), the UE applies the first TPC command value for \( l= \) 0 and applies the second TPC command value for \( l=1 \)
- If the DCI format includes two TPC command values and the PUCCH resource of the PUCCH transmission is associated with \( l=0 \), the UE applies the first TPC command value for \( l=0 \) and ignores the second TPC command value
- If the DCI format includes two TPC command values and the PUCCH resource of the PUCCH transmission is associated with \( l=1 \), the UE applies the second TPC command value for \( l=1 \) and ignores the first TPC command value
- If the DCI format includes one TPC command value, the UE applies the TPC command value for all \( l \) associated with the PUCCH resource of the PUCCH transmission
- \( g_{b, f, c}(i, l)=g_{b, f, c}\left(i-i_{0}, l\right)+\sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(C_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c}(m, l) \) is the current PUCCH power control adjustment state \( l \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) and PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \), where
- The \( \delta_{\text {PUCCH }, b, f, c} \) values are given in Table 7.1.2-1
- \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(C_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\text {PUCCH, } b, f, c}(m, l) \) is a sum of TPC command values in a set \( C_{i} \) of TPC command values with cardinality \( C\left(C_{i}\right) \) that the UE receives between \( K_{\text {PUCCH }}\left(i-i_{0}\right)-1 \) symbols before PUCCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( K_{\text {PUCCH }}(i) \) symbols before PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) for PUCCH power control adjustment state, where \( i_{0}>0 \) is the smallest integer for which \( K_{\text {PUCCH }}\left(i-i_{0}\right) \) symbols before PUCCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) is earlier than \( K_{\text {PUCCH }}(i) \) symbols before PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \)
- If the PUCCH transmission is in response to a detection by the UE of a DCI format, \( K_{\mathrm{PUCCH}}(i) \) is a number of symbols for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) after a last symbol of a corresponding PDCCH reception and before a first symbol of the PUCCH transmission
