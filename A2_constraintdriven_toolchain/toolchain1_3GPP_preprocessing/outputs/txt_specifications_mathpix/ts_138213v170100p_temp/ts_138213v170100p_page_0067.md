9.A PUCCH cell switching

This clause is applicable when a UE is provided a PUCCH-sSCell by pucch-sSCell and the PUCCH-sSCell is activated and does not have a dormant UL/DL active BWP.

A UE can be provided a periodic cell switching pattern for PUCCH transmissions by pucch-sSCellPattern. Each bit of the pattern corresponds to a slot for a reference SCS configuration provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the PCell with a value of ' 0 ' or a value of ' 1 ' indicating, respectively, the PCell or the PUCCH-sSCell as the cell for PUCCH transmissions during the slot of the reference SCS configuration. A slot on the active UL BWP of the PUCCHsSCell does not overlap with more than one slot on the active UL BWP of the Pcell. If a slot for the active UL BWP of the PCell overlaps with more than one slot on the active BWP of the PUCCH-sSCell and the UE would transmit a PUCCH on the PUCCH-sSCell, the UE considers the first of the overlapping slots for the PUCCH transmission on the PUCCH-sSCell.

If a UE is provided pucch-sSCellDyn or pucch-sSCellDynDCI-1-2, a corresponding DCI format associated with generation of HARQ-ACK information by the UE can include a PUCCH cell indicator field [5, TS 38.212] with a value of ' 0 ' or a value of ' 1 ' indicating, respectively, whether a PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information by the UE is on the Pcell or on the PUCCH-sSCell.

A UE transmits a PUCCH on a PUCCH-sSCell with a power that the UE determines as described in clause 7.2.1, where the UE applies
- a p0-PUCCH-Value from pucch-PowerControl in PUCCH-Config for the PUCCH-sSCell for the determination of \( P_{O, P \cup C C H, b, f, c}\left(q_{u}\right) \)
- a pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id from pucch-PowerControl in PUCCH-Config for the PUCCH-sSCell for the determination of \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \)
- a PUCCH power control adjustment state \( g_{b, 0, c}(i, 0) \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of the UL carrier of PUCCH-sSCell \( c \) and PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \) where \( \delta_{\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, 0_{c} c}(i, 0) \) is a TPC command value included in a DCI format associated with generation of HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in a PUCCH transmission on the PUCCH-sSCell as indicated either by a pucch-sSCellPattern or by a PUCCH cell indicator field in the DCI format, or provided by DCI format 2_2 with CRC scrambled by TPC-PUCCH-RNTI for the PUCCH-sSCell as described in clause 11.3
9.1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination

If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList, the UE can be indicated by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList to generate one or two HARQ-ACK codebooks. If the UE is indicated to generate one HARQ-ACK codebook, the HARQACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0 . If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList, the UE multiplexes in a same HARQ-ACK codebook only HARQ-ACK information associated with a same priority index. If the UE is indicated to generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks
- a first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0 and a second HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 1
- the UE is provided first and second for each of (PUCCH-Config, UCI-OnPUSCH, PDSCHcodeBlockGroupTransmission) by \{PUCCH-ConfigurationList, UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-1, PDSCHCodeBlockGroupTransmissionList\} or \{PUCCH-ConfigurationList, UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-2, PDSCHCodeBlockGroupTransmissionList\}, respectively, for use with the first and second HARQ-ACK codebooks, respectively

If a UE receives a PDSCH without receiving a corresponding PDCCH, or if the UE receives a PDCCH indicating a SPS PDSCH release, the UE generates one corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit. If the UE generates two HARQACK codebooks, the UE is indicated by harq-CodebookID, per SPS PDSCH configuration, a HARQ-ACK codebook index for multiplexing the corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit.

If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback and the UE detects a DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1
- the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4
