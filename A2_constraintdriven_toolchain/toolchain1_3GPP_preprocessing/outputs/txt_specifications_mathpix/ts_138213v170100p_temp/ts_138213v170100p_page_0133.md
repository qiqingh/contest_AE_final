- otherwise, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }}=N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {MCG }} \) downlink cells for the MCG where \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{MCG}} \) is provided by pdcch-BlindDetection for the MCG and determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }}=N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {SCG }} \) downlink cells for the SCG where \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {SCG }} \) is provided by pdcch-BlindDetection for the SCG. When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells, or for a cell group when the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to monitor per slot a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \).

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), cells downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG, the UE expects to be provided pdcch-BlindDetection for the MCG and pdcch-BlindDetection for the SCG with values that satisfy
- pdcch-BlindDetection for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection for the SCG <= pdcch-BlindDetectionCA, if the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA, or
- pdcch-BlindDetection for the \( \mathrm{MCG}+ \) pdcch-BlindDetection for the \( \mathrm{SCG}<=N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), clls , if the UE does not report pdcch-BlindDetectionCA.

For NR-DC operation, the UE may indicate, through pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE and pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG\( U E \), respective maximum values for pdcch-BlindDetection for the MCG and pdcch-BlindDetection for the SCG.

If the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA,
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE is \( [1, \ldots, p d c c h \) -BlindDetectionCA-1], and
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE + pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE >= pdcch-BlindDetectionCA.

Otherwise, if \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \max }^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { cells }} \) is a maximum total number of downlink cells that the UE can be configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in UE-NR-Capability,
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE is [1,2,3], and
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE + pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE \( >=N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \max }^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { cells }} \) -

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than two downlink cells, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of nonoverlapped CCEs that the UE can monitor per span when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation and the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per span that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) downlink cells, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-MonitoringCA
- otherwise, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) is the value of pdcch-MonitoringCA

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation and the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per span that corresponds to
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }}=N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r16}}^{\text {MCG }} \) downlink cells for the MCG where \( N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r16}}^{\text {MCG }} \) is provided by pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG, and
- \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }}=N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{r} 16}^{\text {SCG }} \) downlink cells for the SCG where \( N_{\text {cells } \mathrm{r} 16}^{\text {SCG }} \) is provided by pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG
