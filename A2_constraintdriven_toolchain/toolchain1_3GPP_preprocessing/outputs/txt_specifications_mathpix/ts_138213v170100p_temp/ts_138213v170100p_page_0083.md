multicast HARQ-ACK information, with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell in the \( M_{c} \) occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for the SPS PDSCH release or only for the TCI state update or only for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.1.2.
\( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}}=0 \) if the PUSCH is scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field and the DAI field is set to ' 0 '; otherwise, \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{UL}}=1 \).

If a UE is provided fdmed-Reception-Multicast and is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = 'semi-static' for both unicast and multicast HARQ-ACK information, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.2.1, except that harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH is replaced by harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH
- for the first set \( S_{\mathrm{U}} \) of \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mathrm{U}} \) serving cells if a value \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{ULU}} \) of the DAI field associated with unicast HARQ-ACK information is \( V_{\text {T-DAI }}^{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{U}}=1[5, \mathrm{TS} 38.212] \)
- for the second set \( S_{\mathrm{M}} \) of \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DLM}} \) serving cells if a value \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{ULM}} \) of the DAI field associated with multicast HARQACK information is \( V_{\text {T-DAI }}^{\text {UL,M }}=1[5, \mathrm{TS} 38.212] \)

The UE does not generate unicast or multicast HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in the PUSCH transmission when \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{U}}=0 \) or \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{UL} \mathrm{M}}=0 \), respectively, unless the UE receives respectively
- only a unicast or a multicast SPS PDSCH release, or
- only unicast SPS PDSCH(s) or multicast SPS PDSCH(s) having enabled associated HARQ-ACK information reports as described in clause 18, or
- only a TCI state update or a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell, or only a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) having enabled associated HARQ-ACK information report, as described in clause 18, and counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell
in the \( M_{c} \) occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the UE generates only the corresponding unicast or multicast HARQ-ACK information.
\( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{ULU}}=0 \) if the corresponding value of the DAI field is set to ' 0 '; otherwise, \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{U}}=1 . V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{M}}=0 \) if the corresponding value of the DAI field is set to ' 0 '; otherwise, \( V_{\text {T-DAI }}^{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{M}}=1[5, \mathrm{TS} 38.212] \).
9.1.3 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination

This clause applies if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic or with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16. Unless stated otherwise, a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field provides an applicable value.

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook HARQ-ACK information that is in response to a detection of a DCI format that does not include a counter DAI field.

If a UE is provided HARQ-feedbackEnabling-disablingperHARQprocess indicating disabled HARQ-ACK information for a HARQ process associated with a transport block for PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) or for SPS PDSCH receptions on serving cell \( c \), the UE does not multiplex a HARQ-ACK information bit corresponding to the transport block in a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook and does not consider the transport block as received in the determination of \( N_{m, c}^{\text {received }} \) or of \( N_{\mathrm{SPS}, c} \) in clause 9.1.3.1. If the UE is also provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information bits corresponding to CBGs of the transport block in the Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook and does not consider the CBGs as received in the determination of \( N_{m, c}^{\text {received }} \) CBG in clause 9.1.3.1. If the UE is also provided \( H A R Q \)-feedbackEnablingforSPSactive, the UE considers a HARQ process associated with a transport block in a first SPS PDSCH reception, after an activation of SPS PDSCH receptions, to have enabled HARQ-ACK information and the UE provides a HARQ-ACK information bit according to a decoding outcome for the transport block in the first SPS PDSCH reception.

If a UE is indicated to not provide multicast HARQ-ACK information, as described in clause 18, associated with PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) or for SPS PDSCH receptions on serving cell \( c \), the UE does not multiplex corresponding HARQ-ACK information bits in a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook and does not consider any transport blocks as received in the determination of \( N_{m, c}^{\text {received }} \) or of \( N_{\mathrm{SPS}, c} \) in clause 9.1.3.1.
