ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with directiona/CollisionHandling-r16 = 'enabled' for a set of serving cell(s) among the multiple serving cells, and
- indicates support of half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r 16 capability, and
- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 2-0 \) on any of the multiple serving cells,
for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to the UE for reception of SS/PBCH blocks in a first cell of the multiple serving cells by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SystemInformationBlockTypel or by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon or, if the UE is not provided DLorJoint-TCIState or followUnifiedTCIstate, by ssbPositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI associated to physical cell ID with active TCI states, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in the slot if a transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols, and the UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot in
- any of the multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA among the multiple serving cells, and
- any one of the cells corresponding to the same band as the first cell, irrespective of any capability indicated by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion and \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as described in clause 8.1 , the UE does not receive \( \mathrm{PDCCH}, \mathrm{PDSCH} \), or CSI-RS in the slot if a reception would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols. The UE does not expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect the set of symbols to be indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated.

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to receive PDSCH over multiple slots, and if \( t d d \)-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, indicate that, for a slot from the multiple slots, at least one symbol from a set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PDSCH reception in the slot is an uplink symbol, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the slot.

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to transmit PUSCH over multiple slots, and if \( t d d-U L-D L \)-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, indicates that, for a slot from the multiple slots, at least one symbol from a set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PUSCH transmission in the slot is a downlink symbol, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH in the slot.

If a UE
- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with directionalCollisionHandling-r16='enabled' for a set of serving cell(s) among the configured multiple serving cells, and
- indicates support of half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16 capability, and
- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 2-0 \) on any of the multiple serving cells,
the UE determines a reference cell for a symbol as an active cell with the smallest cell index among
- the configured multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA among the multiple serving cells, and
- the cells of each band respectively if the UE is capable of simultaneous transmission and reception by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA for the configured multiple serving cells,
where the symbol is configured as
- downlink, or uplink, as indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated
- uplink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is configured to transmit SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH on the symbol
- downlink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is configured to receive PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS on the symbol.
