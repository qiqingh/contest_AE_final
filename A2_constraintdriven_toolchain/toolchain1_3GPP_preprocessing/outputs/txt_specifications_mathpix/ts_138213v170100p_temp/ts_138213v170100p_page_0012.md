- Case G -960 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{2,9\}+14 \cdot n \). For carrier frequencies within FR2-2, \( n= \)
\[
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 .
\]

From the above cases, if the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks is not provided by ssbSubcarrierSpacing, the applicable cases for a cell depend on a respective frequency band, as provided in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] and [8-2, TS 38.101-2]. A same case applies for all SS/PBCH blocks on the cell. If a 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS is indicated by ssbSubcarrierSpacing, Case B applies for frequency bands with only 15 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and the case specified for 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] applies for frequency bands with 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS or both 15 kHz and 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]. For a UE configured to operate with carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a frequency band of FR2 or with frequencycontiguous carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a frequency band of FR1, if the UE is provided SCS values by ssbSubcarrierSpacing for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on any cells from the set of cells, the UE expects the SCS values to be same.

The candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame are indexed in an ascending order in time from 0 to \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}-1 \), where \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }} \) is determined according to SS/PBCH block patterns for Cases A through G. \( L_{\text {max }} \) is a maximum number of SS/PBCH block indexes in a cell, and the maximum number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks within a half frame is \( L_{\text {max }} \) -
- For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2, and for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, \( L_{\text {max }}=\bar{L}_{\text {max }} \)
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, \( L_{\text {max }}=8 \) for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=10 \) and 15 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks and for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=20 \) and 30 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks

For \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=4 \), a UE determines the 2 LSB bits of a candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211].

For \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}>4 \), a UE determines the 3 LSB bits of a candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211]
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=10 \), the UE determines the 1 MSB bit of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bit \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+7} \) as described in [5, TS 38.212]
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=20 \), the UE determines the 2 MSB bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+6}, \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+7} \) as described in [5, TS 38.212]
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=64 \), the UE determines the 3 MSB bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+5}, \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+6}, \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+7} \) as described in [5, TS 38.212]

A UE can be provided per serving cell by ssb-periodicityServingCell a periodicity of the half frames for reception of the SS/PBCH blocks for the serving cell. If the UE is not configured a periodicity of the half frames for receptions of the SS/PBCH blocks, the UE assumes a periodicity of a half frame. A UE assumes that the periodicity is same for all SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell.

For initial cell selection, a UE may assume that half frames with SS/PBCH blocks occur with a periodicity of 2 frames.
For operation without shared spectrum channel access, an SS/PBCH block index is same as a candidate SS/PBCH block index.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that transmission of SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame is within a discovery burst transmission window that starts from the first symbol of the first slot in a half-frame. The UE can be provided per serving cell by discoveryBurstWindowLength a duration of the discovery burst transmission window. If discoveryBurstWindowLength is not provided, the UE assumes that the duration of the discovery burst transmission window is a half frame. For a serving cell, the UE assumes that a periodicity of the discovery burst transmission window is same as a periodicity of half frames for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst. If MSB \( k, k \geq 1 \), of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1 , the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es)
