For each cell of an [AB-DU in a set of cells of the [AB-DU, the [AB-DU can be provided:
- an identity of the IAB-DU cell by iab-DU-Cellldentity
- a location of an availability indicator (AI) index field in DCI format 2 _ 5 by positionInDCI-AI
- a set of availability combinations by availabilityCombinations, where each availability combination in the set of availability combinations includes
- resourceAvailability indicating availability of soft symbols in one or more slots for the IAB-DU cell, or one or multiple resourceAvailability with each resourceAvailablity indicating availability of soft resources in one or more slots for one RB set group where one RB set group includes one or multiple RB sets, and
- a mapping for the soft symbol, and/or for soft resources, availability combinations provided by resourceAvailability to a corresponding AI index field value in DCI format 2_5 provided by availabilityCombinationId

The IAB-DU can assume a same SCS configuration for availabilityCombinations for a cell as an SCS configuration provided by gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration for the cell.

An AI index field value in a DCI format 2 _ 5 indicates to an [AB-DU a soft symbol or a soft RB set in an RB set group availability in each slot for a number of slots starting from the earliest slot of the [AB-DU which overlaps in time with the slot of the IAB-MT where the IAB-MT detects the DCI format 2_5. The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_5 as provided by SearchSpace. The AI index field includes \( \max \left\{\left[\log _{2}(\operatorname{maxAIindex}+1)\right], 1\right\} \) bits where maxAlindex is the maximum of the values provided by corresponding availabilityCombinationId. An availability for a soft symbol or a soft RB set in an RB set group in a slot is identified by a corresponding value resourceAvailability as provided in Table 14-3.

\begin{table}

\caption{Table 14-3: Mapping between values of resourceAvailability elements and types of soft symbol or soft RB set availability in a slot}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Value & Indication \\
\hline 0 & No indication of availability for soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group \\
\hline 1 & DL soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for UL and Flexible soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 2 & UL soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for DL and Flexible soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 3 & DL and UL soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for Flexible soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 4 & Flexible soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for DL and UL soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 5 & DL and Flexible soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for UL soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 6 & UL and Flexible soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available No indication of availability for DL soft symbols or RB set group \\
\hline 7 & DL, UL, and Flexible soft symbols or soft RB sets in an RB set group are indicated available \\

If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format \( 2 \_5 \) is smaller than a duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots that the [AB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2 _ 5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI formats \( 2-5 \) indicating an availability combination of soft symbols or of soft RB sets in RB set groups in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols or of soft RB sets in an RB set group in the slot. An [AB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2 _ 5 with CRC scrambled by AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets:
- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType \( = \) common;
- a USS set configured by SearchSpace in PDCCH-Config with searchSpaceType = ue-Specific.

The IAB-node can be provided by the parent node a set of RS resource indexes that indicate quasi co-location properties of an [AB-DU cell where simultaneous transmission/reception from the [AB-MT and transmission from the [AB-DU cells is restricted by Child IAB-DU Restricted Beam Indication MAC CE as described in [11, TS 38.321]. The [AB-DU does not transmit on a cell if the IAB node is operating in a non-TDM multiplexing mode using an indicated RS resource index on a symbol or RB set configured as soft in an IAB-DU cell
