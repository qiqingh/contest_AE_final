If a UE
- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, and
- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in multiple CORESETs that have been configured with same or different qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties on active DL BWP(s) of one or more cells
the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a CORESET, and in any other CORESET from the multiple CORESETs that have been configured with qci-Type set to same 'typeD' properties as the CORESET, on the active DL BWP of a cell from the one or more cells
- the CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS, if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index
- the lowest USS set index is determined over all USS sets with at least one PDCCH candidate in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions

If a UE
- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band,
- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in multiple CORESETs that have been configured with same or different qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties on active DL BWP(s) of one or more cells, and
- is provided two-QCLTypeDforPDCCHRepetition
the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a first CORESET with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties and, if any, in a second CORESET with qcl-Type set to second 'typeD' properties that are different than the first 'typeD' properties, and in any other CORESET from the multiple CORESETs with corresponding qcl-Type set to the first 'typeD' properties and/or to the second 'typeD' properties
- the first CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS sets, if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index
- excluding CSS sets and USS sets associated with CORESETs with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties, the second CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS sets; if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index, where the CSS set or the USS set includes searchSpaceLinking with a value indicating, respectively, any CSS set or any USS set associated with CORESETs with qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties
- the lowest USS set index is determined over all USS sets with at least one PDCCH candidate in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions
