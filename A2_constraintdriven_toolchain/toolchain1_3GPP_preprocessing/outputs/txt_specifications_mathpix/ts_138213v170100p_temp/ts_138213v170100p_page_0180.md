- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as downlink or flexible.
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE transmits the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or the PRACH in the slot only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as uplink
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE transmits the SRS only in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols of the slot indicated as uplink symbols by an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0
- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as downlink and also detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to transmit SRS, PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH, in one or more symbols from the set of symbols of the slot
- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as downlink or flexible if the set of symbols of the slot includes symbols corresponding to any repetition of a PUSCH transmission activated by an UL Type 2 grant PDCCH as described in clause 10.2
- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink and also detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in one or more symbols from the set of symbols of the slot

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS or a PDSCH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format \( 2-0 \) with a slot format value other than 255 that indicates a slot format with a subset of symbols from the set of symbols as uplink or flexible, or the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, or PRACH in at least one symbol in the set of the symbols, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot or cancels the PDSCH reception in the slot.

For a UE operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or in FR2-2 when the UE is provided ChannelAccessMode2-r17 = 'enabled', if a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS and the UE is provided CO-DurationsPerCell, for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as downlink or flexible by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, or when tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated are not provided, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot that are not within the remaining channel occupancy duration.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a DL PRS in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) with a slot format value other than 255 that indicates a slot format with a subset of symbols from the set of symbols as uplink, or the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, or PRACH in at least one symbol in the set of the symbols, the UE cancels the DL PRS reception in the set of symbols of the slot.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format \( 2-0 \) with a slot format value other than 255 that indicates a slot format with a subset of symbols from the set of symbols as downlink or flexible, or the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols, then
- If the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS38.214], determined from clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS38.214], or the PRACH transmission in the set of symbols.
- If the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within \( T_{p r o c, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9 and 9.2 .5 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols.
- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from the subset of symbols that occur within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
