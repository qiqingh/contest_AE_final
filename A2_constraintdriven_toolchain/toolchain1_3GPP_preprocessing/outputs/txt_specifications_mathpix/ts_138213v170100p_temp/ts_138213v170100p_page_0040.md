\( \delta_{\mathrm{msg} 2, b, f, c} \) is the TPC command value indicated in the random access response grant corresponding to the random access preamble that the UE transmitted on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of the serving cell \( c \), and
\[
\begin{array}{r}
\Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b_{1}, f_{1} c}=\min \left[\operatorname { m a x } \left(0, P_{\mathrm{CMAX}_{1} f_{1} c}-\left(P_{0 \_\mathrm{SRS}_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{s}\right)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{SRS}_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}(i)\right)+\alpha_{S R S_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{s}\right) .\right.\right.\right. \\
\left.\left.\left.P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right)\right)\right), \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested } b_{1} f_{1} c}\right] ;
\end{array}
\]
where \( \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested, } b_{1} f_{1} c} \) is provided by higher layers and corresponds to the total power ramp-up requested by higher layers from the first to the last preamble for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \).
- \( h_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(i)=\delta_{\text {SRS }, b_{1} f_{1} c}(i) \) if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), or if srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates indicates separate power control adjustment states between SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, and tpc-Accumulation is provided, and the UE detects a DCI format \( 23 K_{\mathrm{SRS}, \min } \) symbols before a first symbol of SRS transmission occasion \( i \), where absolute values of \( \delta_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c} \) are provided in Table 7.1.1-1
- if srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates indicates a same power control adjustment state for SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, the update of the power control adjustment state for SRS transmission occasion \( i \) occurs at the beginning of each SRS resource in the SRS resource set \( q_{s} \); otherwise, the update of the power control adjustment state SRS transmission occasion \( i \) occurs at the beginning of the first transmitted SRS resource in the SRS resource set \( q_{s} \).

If a UE transmits SRS based on a configuration by SRS-PosResourceSet on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), the UE determines the SRS transmission power \( P_{S R S_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(i, q_{s}\right) \) in SRS transmission occasion \( i \) as
\[
P_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(i, q_{s}\right)=\min \left\{\begin{array}{l}
P_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f, c}(i), \\
P_{\mathrm{O} \_\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}(i)\right)+\alpha_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \cdot P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)
\end{array}\right\}[\mathrm{dBm}]
\]
where,
- \( \quad P_{0 \_\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \) and \( \alpha_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \) are provided by \( p 0-r 16 \) and \( a \) lpha-r 16 respectively, for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), and SRS resource set \( q_{s} \) is indicated by SRS-PosResourceSetld from SRSPosResourceSet, and
- \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB calculated by the UE, as described in clause 7.1.1 in case of an active DL BWP of a serving cell \( c \), using RS resource indexed \( q_{d} \) in a serving or non-serving cell for SRS resource set \( q_{s}\left[6\right. \), TS 38.214]. A configuration for RS resource index \( q_{d} \) associated with SRS resource set \( q_{s} \) is provided by pathlossReferenceRS-Pos
- if a ssb-IndexNcell is provided, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower-r16
- if a \( d l \)-PRS-Resourceld is provided, referenceSignalPower is provided by dl-PRS-ResourcePower

If the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state and determines that the UE is not able to accurately measure \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \), or the UE is not provided with pathlossReferenceRS-Pos, the UE calculates \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) using a RS resource obtained from the SS/PBCH block of the serving cell that the UE uses to obtain MIB. If the UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state and determines that the UE is not able to accurately measure \( P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right) \), the UE does not transmit SRS for the SRS resource set.

The UE may indicate a capability for a number of pathloss estimates that the UE can simultaneously maintain for all SRS resource sets provided by SRS-PosResourceSet in addition to the up to four pathloss estimates that the UE maintains per serving cell for PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions and for SRS transmissions configured by SRS-Resource-
