a bit value of 0 indicates transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and subset of PRBs, and a bit value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and subset of PRBs.
11.2A Cancellation indication

If a UE is provided UplinkCancellation, the UE is provided, in one or more serving cells, search space sets for monitoring the first PDCCH candidate with a CCE aggregation level of \( L_{C I} \) CCEs of each search space set for detection of a DCI format 2_4 [5, TS 38.212] with a CI-RNTI provided by ci-RNTI as described in clause 10.1. UplinkCancellation additionally provides to the UE
- a set of serving cells, by ci-ConfigurationPerServingCell, that includes a set of serving cell indexes and a corresponding set of locations for fields in DCI format 2_4 by positionInDCI
- a number of fields in DCI format 2_4, by positionInDCI-forSUL, for each serving cell for a SUL carrier, if the serving cell is configured with a SUL carrier
- an information payload size for DCI format 2_4 by dci-PayloadSize-ForCI
- an indication for time-frequency resources by timeFrequencyRegion

For a serving cell having an associated field in a DCI format 2_4, for the field denote by
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) a number of bits provided by ci-PayloadSize
- \( \quad B_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) a number of PRBs provided by frequencyRegionforCI in timeFrequencyRegion
- \( \quad T_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) a number of symbols, excluding symbols for reception of SS/PBCH blocks and DL symbols indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, from a number of symbols that
- is provided by timeDurationforCI in timeFrequencyRegion, if the PDCCH monitoring periodicity for the search space set with the DCI format 2_4 is one slot and there are more than one PDCCH monitoring occasions in a slot, or
- is equal to the PDCCH monitoring periodicity, otherwise.
- \( G_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) a number of partitions for the \( T_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) symbols provided by timeGranularityforCI in timeFrequencyRegion
\( G_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) sets of bits from the MSB of the \( N_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) bits have a one-to-one mapping with \( G_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) groups of symbols where each of the first \( G_{\mathrm{Cl}}-T_{\mathrm{Cl}}+\left\lfloor T_{\mathrm{Cl}} / G_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right\rfloor \cdot G_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) groups includes \( \left\lfloor T_{\mathrm{Cl}} / G_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right\rfloor \) symbols and each of the remaining \( T_{\mathrm{Cl}}-\left\lfloor T_{\mathrm{Cl}} / G_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right\rfloor \cdot G_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) groups includes \( \left[T_{\mathrm{CI}} / G_{\mathrm{CI}}\right] \) symbols. A UE determines a symbol duration with respect to a SCS configuration of an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 2_4 detection.

For a group of symbols, \( N_{\mathrm{BI}}=N_{\mathrm{Cl}} / G_{C I} \) bits from MSB of each set of bits have a one-to-one mapping with \( N_{\mathrm{Bl}} \) groups of PRBs where each of the first \( N_{\mathrm{BI}}-B_{\mathrm{Cl}}+\left\lfloor B_{\mathrm{Cl}} / N_{\mathrm{BI}}\right\rfloor \cdot N_{\mathrm{BI}} \) groups includes \( \left\lfloor B_{\mathrm{CI}} / N_{\mathrm{BI}}\right\rfloor \) PRBs and each of the remaining \( B_{\mathrm{Cl}}-\left\lfloor B_{\mathrm{Cl}} / N_{\mathrm{Bl}}\right\rfloor \cdot N_{\mathrm{Bl}} \) groups includes \( \left\lceil B_{\mathrm{Cl}} / N_{\mathrm{Bl}}\right\rceil \) PRBs. A UE determines a first PRB index as \( N_{R F R}^{\text {start }}=O_{\text {carrier }}+ R B_{\text {start }} \) and a number of contiguous RBs as \( B_{\mathrm{Cl}}=L_{\mathrm{RB}} \) from frequencyRegionfor \( C I \) that indicates an offset \( R B_{\text {start }} \) and a length \( L_{\mathrm{RB}} \) as RIV according to [6, TS 38.214], and from offsetToCarrier in FrequencyInfoUL-SIB or FrequencyInfoUL that indicates \( O_{\text {carrier }} \) for a SCS configuration of an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 2_4 detection.

An indication by a DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell is applicable to a PUSCH transmission or an SRS transmission on the serving cell. If the PUSCH transmission or the SRS transmission is scheduled by a DCI format, the indication by the DCI format 2_4 is applicable to the PUSCH transmission or SRS transmission only if the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format is earlier than the first symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format 2_4.

For the serving cell, the UE determines the first symbol of the \( T_{\mathrm{CI}} \) symbols to be the first symbol that is after \( T^{\prime}{ }_{\text {proc, } 2} \) from the end of a PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format 2_4, where \( T^{\prime}{ }_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is obtained from \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) for PUSCH processing capability 2 [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=d_{\text {offset }} \cdot 2^{-\mu \nu L} / 2^{-\mu} \) where \( d_{\text {offset }} \) is provided by delta_Offset, \( \mu \) being the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH and the smallest SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{UL}} \) provided in scs-SpecificCarrierList of FrequencyInfoUL or FrequencyInfoUL-SIB.
