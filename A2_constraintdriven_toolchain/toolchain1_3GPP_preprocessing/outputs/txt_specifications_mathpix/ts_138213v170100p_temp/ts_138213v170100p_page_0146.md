for a USS, \( Y_{p, n_{s, f}^{\mu}}^{\mu}=\left(A_{p} \cdot Y_{p, n_{s, f}^{\mu}-1}^{\mu}\right) \bmod D, Y_{p,-1}=n_{\mathrm{RNTI}} \neq 0, A_{p}=39827 \) for \( p \bmod 3=0, A_{p}=39829 \) for \( \operatorname{pmod} 3=1, A_{p}=39839 \) for \( p \bmod 3=2 \), and \( D=65537 \);
\( i=0, \cdots, L-1 ; \)
\( N_{\text {CCE } p} \) is the number of CCEs, numbered from 0 to \( N_{\text {CCE } p}-1 \), in CORESET \( p \) and, if any, per RB set;
\( n_{C I} \) is the carrier indicator field value if the UE is configured with a carrier indicator field by
CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig for the serving cell on which PDCCH is monitored; otherwise, including for any CSS, \( n_{C I}=0 \);
\( m_{s, n_{C I}}^{(L)}=0, \cdots, M_{s, n_{C I}}^{(L)}-1 \), where \( M_{s, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) is the number of PDCCH candidates the UE is configured to monitor for aggregation level \( L \) of a search space set \( s \) for a serving cell corresponding to \( n_{C I} \);
for any CSS, \( M_{s, \max }^{(L)}=M_{s, 0}^{(L)} \);
for a USS, \( M_{s_{1} \max }^{(L)} \) is the maximum of \( M_{s_{1} n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) over all configured \( n_{C I} \) values for a CCE aggregation level \( L \) of search space set \( s \);
the RNTI value used for \( n_{\text {RNTI }} \) is the C-RNTI.
For search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \( s_{j} \) and \( s_{i} \), respectively, a UE monitors, in monitoring occasions with same index according to each of search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) in a slot, PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) and \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \), with \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \), for detection of a DCI format with same information. The UE expects \( k_{s_{i}}= k_{s_{j}}, o_{s_{i}}=o_{s_{j}}, T_{s_{i}}=T_{s_{j}}, M_{s_{i}}^{(L)}=M_{s_{j}}^{(L)} \), and a same number of non-overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions per slot based on corresponding monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot, for search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \). For CORESET \( p_{i} \) associated with the search space set \( s_{i} \) and for CORESET \( p_{j} \) associated with the search space set \( s_{j} \), the UE is provided tci-
PresentInDCI or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 for either none or both of CORESETs \( p_{i} \) and \( p_{j} \). For CORESET \( p_{i} \) associated with the search space set \( s_{i} \) and for CORESET \( p_{j} \) associated with the search space set \( s_{j} \), the UE is either not provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for any of the two CORESETs, or is provided coresetPoollndex value of 1 for both CORESETs.

A UE can indicate by countLinkedCandidates a capability for counting PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) and \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) either as 2 PDCCH candidates or as 3 PDCCH candidates.

For search space sets \( s_{i}, s_{j}, s_{k} \), and \( s_{l} \), that include searchSpaceLinking with values \( s_{j}, s_{i}, s_{l} \), and \( s_{k} \), respectively, a UE expects to simultaneously monitor PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} \), and \( m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)}=m_{s_{l}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} \) only if a first CCE of \( m_{s_{i} n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} \) or \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} \) has different index than a first CCE of \( m_{s_{k} n}^{(16)}{ }_{C I, 2} \) or \( m_{s_{l} n n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} \) in a CORESET configured with \( c c e \) -REG-MappingType \( = \) 'nonInterleaved' and with duration of one symbol.

If a UE
- is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoringcapability for a downlink cell,
- is provided, by searchSpaceLinking, for search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) on the downlink cell respective values \( s_{j} \) and \( s_{i} \), and
- indicates three-BDforSSsetLinking
the UE counts each PDCCH candidate for the one of the search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) that the UE monitors PDCCH in the later span, as two PDCCH candidates. The UE does not expect a first PDCCH candidate from search space set \( s_{i} \) or \( s_{j} \) and a second PDCCH candidate from a search space set \( s_{k} \) that does not include searchSpaceLinking to use a same set of CCEs and same scrambling in a same CORESET, and provide respective first and second DCI formats with same size, in any span other than the first span in a slot.

A UE does not expect to be provided freqMonitorLocations for a search space set \( s \) in a serving cell if intraCellGuardBandsDL-List indicates that no intra-cell guard-bands are configured for the serving cell.

A UE that
