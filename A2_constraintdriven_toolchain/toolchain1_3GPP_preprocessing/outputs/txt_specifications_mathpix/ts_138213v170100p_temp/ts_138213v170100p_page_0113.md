scheduling the \( i \)-th PDSCH , or providing the \( i \)-th DCI format without scheduling PDSCH , with corresponding HARQ-ACK information on a PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs, and the SCS configuration for the PUCCH serving cell.
- if there is an aperiodic CSI report multiplexed in a PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( S_{0} \) is not before a symbol with CP starting after \( T_{\text {proc }, C S I}^{\text {mux }}=\max \left((Z+d) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C}+\right. \left.T_{\text {switch }}, d_{2,2}\right) \) after a last symbol of
- any PDCCH with the DCI format scheduling an overlapping PUSCH, and
- any PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH, or providing a DCI format, with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in an overlapping PUCCH in the slot
where \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configuration of the PDCCHs, the smallest SCS configuration for the group of the overlapping PUSCHs, and the smallest SCS configuration of CSI-RS associated with the DCI format scheduling the PUSCH with the multiplexed aperiodic CSI report, and \( d=2 \) for \( \mu=0,1, d=3 \) for \( \mu=2 \), and \( d=4 \) for \( \mu=3 . T_{\text {sw itch }} \) is defined in [6, TS 38.214] and it is applied only if \( Z_{1} \) of Table 5.4-1 in [6, TS 38.214] is applied to the determination of \( Z \).
- \( \quad N_{1}, N_{2}, d_{1,1}, d_{2,1}, d_{2,2} \), and \( Z \) are defined in [6, TS 38.214] and \( \kappa \) and \( T_{C} \) are defined in [4, TS 38.211].

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot, one of the PUCCHs includes HARQ-ACK information in response to an SPS PDSCH reception, and any PUSCH is not in response to a DCI format detection, the UE expects that the first symbol \( S_{0} \) of the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH satisfies the first of the previous timeline conditions with the exception that components associated to a SCS configuration for a PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH or a PUSCH are absent from the timeline conditions.

A UE does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH that is in response to a DCI format detection to overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH that does not satisfy the above timing conditions.

A UE that
- is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells, and
- is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and
- is provided ackNackFeedbackMode \( = \) separate
does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission triggered by a detection of a DCI format in a PDCCH received in a CORESET from the first CORESETs to overlap in time with a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission triggered by a detection of a DCI format in a PDCCH received in a CORESET from the second CORESETs.

If there is one or more aperiodic CSI reports multiplexed on a PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs and if symbol \( S_{0} \) is before symbol \( Z_{\text {ref }}^{\text {m }} \) that is a next uplink symbol with CP starting after \( Z_{\text {proc, } \mathrm{CSI}}^{\text {mux }}= \left(Z^{\prime}+d\right) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C} \) after the end of the last symbol of
- the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, and
- the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and
- the last symbol of aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference measurements, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for triggered CSI report \( n \)
the UE is not required to update the CSI report for the triggered CSI report \( n . Z^{\prime} \) is defined in \( [6, \operatorname{TS} 38.214] \) and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of the PDCCHs scheduling the PUSCHs, the smallest SCS configuration of aperiodic CSI-RSs associated with DCI formats provided by the PDCCHs triggering the aperiodic CSI reports, and the smallest SCS configuration of the overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs and \( d=2 \) for \( \mu=0,1, d=3 \) for \( \mu=2 \), and \( d=4 \) for \( \mu=3 \).

If a UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include HARQ-ACK information, and/or SR, and/or CSI reports and any PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in the slot satisfies the above timing conditions and does not overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH in the slot that does not satisfy the above timing conditions, the UE multiplexes the
