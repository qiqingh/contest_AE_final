- a slot index for a slot provided by slotIndex
- a set of symbols for a slot by symbols-IAB-MT where
- if symbols-IAB-MT = allDownlink, all symbols in the slot are downlink
- if symbols-IAB-MT = allUplink, all symbols in the slot are uplink
- if symbols-IAB-MT = explicit, nrofDownlinkSymbols provides a number of downlink first symbols in the slot and nrofUplinkSymbols provides a number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If nrofDownlinkSymbols is not provided, there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if noofUplinkSymbols is not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible.
- if symbols-IAB-MT = explicit-IAB-MT, nrofUplinkSymbols provides a number of uplink first symbols in the slot and nrofDownlinkSymbols provides a number of downlink last symbols in the slot. If nrofUplinkSymbols is not provided, there are no uplink first symbols in the slot and if nrofDownlinkSymbols is not provided, there are no downlink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible.

If an [AB-MT is configured with an MCG and an SCG, is not capable of simultaneous transmission and reception, and would simultaneously transmit and receive on the MCG and the SCG,
- if flexible symbols are configured by both parent nodes for operation with inter-donor NR-DC, the IAB-MT operates according to the scheduling from the MCG
- otherwise, if the [AB-MT is configured with multiple serving cells, is provided directionalCollisionHandlingr17 = 'enabled' for a set of serving cell(s) from the multiple serving cells, and indicates half-DuplexTDD-CASameSCS capability across MCG and SCG for NR-DC operation, the [AB-MT applies the procedures for resolving directional collisions as described in clause 11.1 for resolving directional collisions across serving cells..

An [AB-MT can be provided, by SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell, a list of slot format combinations applicable for one serving cell and, by SlotFormatIndicator, a configuration for monitor a DCI format \( 2-0 \) indicating a slot format combination, from the list of slot format combinations, over a number of slots as described in clause 11.1.1. In addition to the slot formats in Table 11.1.1-1, an SFI field for an [AB-MT in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) can indicate to the [AB-MT a slot format from the slot formats in Table 14-2.
