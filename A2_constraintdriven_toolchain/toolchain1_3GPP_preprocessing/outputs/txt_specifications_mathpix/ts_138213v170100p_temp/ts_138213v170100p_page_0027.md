first SRI field value and a value associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.228/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value if the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook',
where the RS resource is either on serving cell \( c \) or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking
- If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \), and
- if two spatial settings from PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo are activated for a PUCCH resource with a lowest index, the UE uses the same RS resource index \( q_{d} \) as for a PUCCH transmission with a spatial setting from the two spatial settings with lowest index in the PUCCH resource with the lowest index
- else, if the UE is provided a spatial setting by PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo for a PUCCH resource with a lowest index for active UL BWP \( b \) of each carrier \( f \) and serving cell \( c \), as described in clause 9.2.2, the UE uses the same RS resource index \( q_{d} \) as for a PUCCH transmission in the PUCCH resource with the lowest index
- If the PUSCH transmission is not scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \), and if the UE is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS and is not provided PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS and PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-r16, the UE uses the same RS resource index \( q_{d} \) as for an SRS resource set with an SRS resource associated with the PUSCH transmission
- If
- the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and the UE is not provided a spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission, or
- the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) that does not include an SRI field, or
- SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl is not provided to the UE,
the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) with a respective PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id value being equal to zero where the RS resource is either on serving cell \( c \) or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking
- If
- the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) on serving cell \( c \),
- the UE is not provided PUCCH resources for the active UL BWP of serving cell \( c \), and
- the UE is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0
the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP of the serving cell \( c \). If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the RS resource index \( q_{d} \) based on the first TCI state.
- If
- the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) on serving cell \( c \),
- the UE is not provided a spatial setting for PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP of the primary cell [11, TS 38.321], and
- the UE is provided enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0
the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP of the serving cell \( c \). If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1, the UE determines the RS resource index \( q_{d} \) based on the first TCI state.
