On PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with a same long DRX Cycle, a UE does not expect to detect more than one DCI format 2_6 with different values of the Wake-up indication bit for the UE or with different values of the bitmap for the UE.

The UE does not monitor PDCCH for detecting DCI format 2_6 during Active Time [11, TS 38.321].
If a UE reports for an active DL BWP a MinTimeGap value that is X slots prior to the beginning of a slot where the UE would start the drx-onDurationTimer, the UE is not required to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2 _ 6 during the X slots, where X corresponds to the MinTimeGap value of the SCS of the active DL BWP in Table 10.3-1.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE detects DCI format 2_6, the physical layer of a UE reports the value of the Wake-up indication bit for the UE to higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE does not detect DCI format 2_6, the physical layer of the UE does not report a value of the Wake-up indication bit to higher layers for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE
- is not required to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6, as described in clauses 10, 11.1, 12, and in clause 5.7 of [11, TS 38.321] for all corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions outside Active Time prior to a next long DRX cycle, or
- does not have any PDCCH monitoring occasions for detection of DCI format 2_6 outside Active Time of a next long DRX cycle
the physical layer of the UE reports a value of 1 for the Wake-up indication bit to higher layers for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) and if one or both of DCI format 0_1 and DCI format 1_1 include a SCell dormancy indication field,
- the SCell dormancy indication field is a bitmap with size equal to a number of groups of configured SCells, provided by dormancyGroupWithinActiveTime,
- each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells from the number of groups of configured Scells
- if the UE detects a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or a DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) that does not include a carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) that includes a carrier indicator field with value equal to 0 , and if the DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) does not indicate UL grant Type 2 release nor deactivate semi-persistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH, or if the DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) does not indicate SPS PDSCH release
- a ' 0 ' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided by dormantBWP-Id, for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells
- a '1' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
- an active DL BWP, provided by firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id, for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP
