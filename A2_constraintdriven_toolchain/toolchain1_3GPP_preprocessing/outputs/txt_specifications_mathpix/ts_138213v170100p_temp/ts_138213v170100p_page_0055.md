the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCIState for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \).

If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell [11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the PDCCH that includes the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) and the PDCCH order have same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties. If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure for a secondary cell, the UE may assume the DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties of the CORESET associated with the Typel-PDCCH CSS set for receiving the PDCCH that includes the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \).

A RAR UL grant schedules a PUSCH transmission from the UE. The contents of the RAR UL grant, starting with the MSB and ending with the LSB, are given in Table 8.2-1.

If the value of the frequency hopping flag is 0 , the UE transmits the PUSCH without frequency hopping; otherwise, the UE transmits the PUSCH with frequency hopping.

The UE determines the MCS of the PUSCH transmission from the first sixteen indexes of the applicable MCS index table for PUSCH as described in [6, TS 38.214].

The TPC command value \( \delta_{\mathrm{msg} 2, b, f, c} \) is used for setting the power of the PUSCH transmission, as described in clause 7.1.1, and is interpreted according to Table 8.2-2.

The CSI request field is reserved.
The ChannelAccess-CPext field indicates a channel access type and CP extension for operation with shared spectrum channel access [15, TS 37.213] as defined in Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in TS 38.212 or Table 7.3.1.1.1-4A in TS 38.212 if ChannelAccessMode-r16 = "semiStatic" is provided.

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH using same SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and the LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the
