10 UE procedure for receiving control information
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both MCG and SCG except for PDCCH monitoring in Type0/0A/2/2A -PDCCH CSS sets where the UE is not required to apply the procedures in this clause for the SCG
- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms 'secondary cell', 'secondary cells' , 'serving cell', 'serving cells' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.
- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms 'secondary cell', 'secondary cells', 'serving cell', 'serving cells' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in one or more CORESETs on the active DL BWP on each activated serving cell configured with PDCCH monitoring according to corresponding search space sets where monitoring implies receiving each PDCCH candidate and decoding according to the monitored DCI formats.

In the remaining of this clause, when a PDCCH reception by a UE includes two PDCCH candidates from corresponding search space sets, as described in clause 10.1
- a PDCCH monitoring occasion is the union of the PDCCH monitoring occasions for the two PDCCH candidates
- the start of the PDCCH reception is the start of the earlier PDCCH candidate
- the end of the PDCCH reception is the end of the PDCCH candidate that ends later

The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10,11.1, and 11.1.1.

A UE obtains an indication to monitor PDCCH on the active DL BWP of the serving cell for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs
- per slot, as in Tables 10.1-2 and 10.1-3, if monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability, or
- per span, as in Tables 10.1-2A and 10.1-3A, if monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability, or
- per group of \( X_{s} \) slots according to combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \), as in Tables 10.1-2B and 10.1-3B, if monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability or if monitoringCapabilityConfig is not provided
