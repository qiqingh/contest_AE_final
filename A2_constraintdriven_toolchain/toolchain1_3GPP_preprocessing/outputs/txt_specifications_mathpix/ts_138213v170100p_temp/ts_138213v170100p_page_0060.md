secondaryPUCCHgroup is provided, simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH is replaced by simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup.

For unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is provided a PUCCH-sSCell as described in clause 9.A, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both the primary cell and the PUCCH-sSCell.

If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is replaced by the relevant entry in pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16.

In the remaining of this clause, when a PDCCH reception by a UE includes two PDCCH candidates from corresponding search space sets, as described in clause 10.1
- a PDCCH monitoring occasion is the union of the PDCCH monitoring occasions for the two PDCCH candidates
- the start of the PDCCH reception is the start of the earlier PDCCH candidate
- the end of the PDCCH reception is the end of the PDCCH candidate that ends later

The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10, 11.1, and 11.1.1.

In the remaining of this clause, a last DCI format is the DCI format that a UE detects in a last PDCCH monitoring occasion from the PDCCH monitoring occasions for which the UE would provide HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in a same slot.

If a UE
- is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells, and
- is provided coresetPoollndex with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and
- is provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate
the UE shall separately apply the procedures described in clauses 9.1 and 9.2 for reporting HARQ-ACK information associated with the first CORESETs on active DL BWP of the serving cells and for reporting HARQ-ACK information associated with the second CORESETs on active DL BWP of the serving cells, and the UE does not expect to be provided with subslotLengthForPUCCH or to be indicated by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList to generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks on active DL BWP of the serving cells. HARQ-ACK information reporting is associated with a CORESET through a reception of a PDCCH with a DCI format triggering the reporting of the HARQ-ACK information by the UE.

For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes \( P H \) assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively.

If a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PUCCH-SCell.
A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index 0 or of priority index 1 . For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, the priority index is 0 .

If a UE is provided one PUCCH-Config
- if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in the PUCCH-Config, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in the PUCCH-Config is within the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols in the PUCCH-Config
If a UE is provided two PUCCH-Config
