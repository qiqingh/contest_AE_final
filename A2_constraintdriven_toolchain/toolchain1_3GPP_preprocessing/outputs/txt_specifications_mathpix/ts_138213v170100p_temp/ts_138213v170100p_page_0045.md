the maximum transmission power on the SCG is determined as
- \( \min \left(\widehat{P}_{\text {SCG }}, \widehat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {NR-DC }}-\widehat{P}_{\text {MCG }}^{\text {actual }}\right) \), if the UE determines transmissions on the MCG with a \( \widehat{P}_{\text {MCG }}^{\text {actual }} \) total power
- \( \quad \hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {NR-DC }} \), if the UE does not determine any transmissions on the MCG
where
- \( T_{\text {offset }}=\max \left\{T_{\text {proc }, M C G}^{\max }, T_{\text {proc }, S C G}^{\max }\right\} \),
- \( T_{\text {proc }, M C G}^{\max } \) and \( T_{\text {proc }, S C G}^{\max } \) is the maximum of \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}, T_{\text {proc }, C S I}, T_{\text {proc }, \text { release }}^{\operatorname{mux}}, T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\operatorname{mux}} \), and \( T_{\text {proc }, C S I}^{\operatorname{mux}} \) based on the configurations on the MCG and the SCG, respectively, when the UE indicates the value of 'long' for the capability,
- \( T_{\text {proc }, \text { MCG }}^{\max } \) and \( T_{\text {proc }, \text { SCG }}^{\max } \) is the maximum of \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}, T_{\text {proc }, \text { release }}^{\operatorname{mux}}, T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\operatorname{mux}} \) based on the configurations on the MCG and the SCG, respectively, when the UE indicates the value of 'short' for the capability, and
- \( \hat{P}_{\text {MCG }}^{\text {actual }} \) is the total power for the transmissions on the MCG that overlap with the transmission occasion on the SCG where \( \hat{P}_{\text {MCG }}^{\text {actual }} \) is determined based on transmissions configured by higher layers and on transmissions scheduled by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last symbol that is at least \( T_{\text {offset }} \) before the first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG.

The UE does not expect to have PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS transmissions on the MCG that
- are scheduled/triggered by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last symbol that is earlier by less than \( T_{\text {offset }} \) from the first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG, and
- overlap with the transmission occasion on the SCG

The UE does not expect to receive a positive TPC command value in a DCI format \( 2 \_2 \) or a DCI format \( 2 \_3 \) in a PDCCH reception with a last symbol that is less than \( T_{\text {offset }} \) before the first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG, if the transmission on the MCG overlaps with the transmission occasion on the SCG.

The UE is not required to apply a TPC command the UE receives in a DCI format \( 2 \_2 \) or a DCI format \( 2 \_3 \) in a PDCCH reception with a last symbol that is less than \( T_{\text {offset }} \) before the first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG, if the transmission on the MCG overlaps with the transmission occasion on the SCG.
7.7 Power headroom report

The types of UE power headroom reports are the following. A Type 1 UE power headroom \( P H \) that is valid for PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \). A Type 3 UE power headroom PH that is valid for SRS transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \).

A UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell [11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the first DCI format scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block since a power headroom report was triggered if the power headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format. Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus \( T_{\text {proc. } 2}=T_{\text {proc. } 2} \) where \( T_{\text {proc. } 2} \) is determined according to [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2, l}=1, d_{2,2}=0 \), and with \( \mu_{D L} \) corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using the configured grant.

If a UE
- is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, and
- determines a Type 1 power headroom report and a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell
the UE
