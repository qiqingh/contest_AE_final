- For a PUSCH transmission configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig, if rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant is included in ConfiguredGrantConfig, a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) is provided by a value of pathlossReferenceIndex included in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant where the RS resource is either on serving cell \( c \) or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking. If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and for configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) are provided by respective values of pathlossReferenceIndex and pathlossReferenceIndex 2 in rrcConfiguredUplinkGrant.
- For a PUSCH transmission configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig that does not include rrcConfiguredUplinkGrant, the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) from a value of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that is mapped to a SRI field value in a DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission.
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' and the DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields, the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) from respective first and second values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that are mapped to the first and second SRI values corresponding to each SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook', respectively.
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook' and the DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields, the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) from respective first and second values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that are mapped to the first SRI value corresponding to the first SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook', and the value, associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, corresponding to the second SRS resource set with usage set to 'nonCodebook'.
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and the DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission does not include an SRI field, the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) with respective first and second PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id value being equal to zero and one.
- If the DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission does not include an SRI field, the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) with a respective \( P U S C H \) - \( P \) athloss ReferenceRS-Id value being equal to zero
where the RS resource is either on serving cell \( c \) or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of pathlossReferenceLinking
- If the UE is provided enablePL-RS-UpdateForPUSCH-SRS, a mapping between sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld and PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id values can be updated by a MAC CE as described in [11, TS 38.321]
- For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, or for a PUSCH transmission configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig and activated, as described in clause 10.2, by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) from the PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id mapped to sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld \( =0 \). If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) from respective PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id mapped to sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld \( =0 \) of sri-PUSCHMappingToAddModList and sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld \( =0 \) of sri-PUSCH-MappingToAddModList2, respectively.
- If the UE is not provided enablePL-RS-UpdateForPUSCH-SRS
- For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, if the UE is provided two SRS resources in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', the UE determines first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) with respective first and second PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id values being equal to 0 and 1 .
\( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)= \) referenceSignalPower - higher layer filtered RSRP, where referenceSignalPower is provided by higher layers and RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] for the reference serving cell and the higher layer filter configuration provided by QuantityConfig is defined in [12, TS 38.331] for the reference serving cell
