For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE can be provided by higher layer signalling with
- \( P \leq 3 \) CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided, or if a value of coresetPoolIndex is same for all CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is provided
- \( P \leq 5 \) CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET

For each CORESET, the UE is provided the following by ControlResourceSet:
- a CORESET index \( p \), by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetId-v1610, where
- \( 0<p<12 \) if coresetPoollndex is not provided, or if a value of coresetPoollndex is same for all CORESETs if coresetPoollndex is provided;
- \( 0<p<16 \) if coresetPoollndex is not provided for a first CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET;
- a DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization value by pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID;
- a precoder granularity for a number of REGs in the frequency domain where the UE can assume use of a same DM-RS precoder by precoderGranularity;
- a number of consecutive symbols provided by duration;
- a set of resource blocks provided by frequencyDomainResources;
- CCE-to-REG mapping parameters provided by cce-REG-MappingType;
- an antenna port quasi co-location, from a set of antenna port quasi co-locations provided by TCI-State, indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception;
- an indication for a presence or absence of a transmission configuration indication (TCI) field for a DCI format, other than DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), that schedules PDSCH receptions or has associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH and is provided by a PDCCH in CORESET \( p \), by tci-PresentInDCI or tci-PresentDC1-1-2.

When precoderGranularity \( = \) allContiguousRBs, a UE does not expect
- to be configured a set of resource blocks of a CORESET that includes more than four sub-sets of resource blocks that are not contiguous in frequency
- any RE of a CORESET to overlap with any RE determined from lte-CRS-ToMatchAround, or from LTE-CRSPatternList, or with any RE of a SS/PBCH block.

If a UE is provided two TCI states indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in a CORESET associated with a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, the UE may assume the quasi co-location information indicated in both of the two TCI states for the PDCCH reception in the CORESET.

For each CORESET in a DL BWP of a serving cell, a respective frequencyDomainResources provides a bitmap
- if a CORESET is not associated with any search space set configured with freqMonitorLocations, the bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending order of the PRB index in the DL BWP bandwidth of \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{BWP}} \) PRBs with starting common RB position \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {start }} \), where the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index \( 6 \cdot\left[N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {start }} / 6\right] \) if \( r b \)-Offset is not provided, or the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {start }}+N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {offset }} \) where \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {offset }} \) is provided by rb-Offset.
- if a CORESET is associated with at least one search space set configured with freqMonitorLocations, the first \( N_{\text {RBG }, \text { set0 }}^{\text {size }} \) bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending order of the PRB index in each RB set \( k \) in the DL BWP bandwidth of \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{BWP}} \) PRBs with starting common RB position \( R B_{s 0+k, \mathrm{DL}}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) [6, TS 38.214], where the first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index \( R B_{s 0+k, \mathrm{DL}}^{\text {start }, \mu}+N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {offset }} \) and \( k \) is indicated by freqMonitorLocations if provided for a search space set; otherwise, \( k=0 . N_{\mathrm{RBG}, \text { set } 0}^{\text {size }}=\left\lfloor\left(N_{\mathrm{RB}, \text { set } 0}^{\text {size }}-N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {offset }}\right) / 6\right\rfloor, N_{\mathrm{RB}, \text { set } 0}^{\text {size }} \) is a number of available PRBs in the RB set 0 for the DL BWP, and \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {offset }} \) is provided by \( r b \)-Offset or \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {off }}=0 \) if \( r b \)-Offset is not provided.
