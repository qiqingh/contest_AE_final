- if the UE does not detect any DCI format that includes a total DAI field in a last PDCCH monitoring occasion within the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \) PDCCH monitoring occasions where the UE detects at least one DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, for any serving cell \( c, V_{\mathrm{DAI}, m_{\mathrm{last}}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) or \( V_{\mathrm{DAL}, m_{\mathrm{last}, g}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), respectively, is the value of the counter DAI in a last DCI format the UE detects in the last PDCCH monitoring occasion
- if the UE detects at least one DCI format that includes a total DAI field in a last PDCCH monitoring occasion within the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \), for G-RNTI \( g \) or G-CS-RNTI \( g \), PDCCH monitoring occasions where the UE detects at least one DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, for any serving cell \( c, V_{\mathrm{DAL}, m_{\text {last }}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) or \( V_{\mathrm{DAL}, m_{\text {last }, g}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), respectively, is the value of the total DAI in the at least one DCI format that includes a total DAI field
- \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}, m_{\text {last }}}^{\mathrm{DL}}=0 \) or \( V_{\mathrm{DAL}, m_{\text {last }, g}}^{\mathrm{DL}}=0 \) if the UE does not detect any DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, for any serving cell \( c \) in any of the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \) PDCCH monitoring occasions, respectively.
- \( U_{\mathrm{DAl}, c} \) or \( U_{\mathrm{DAl}, c, g} \), for G-RNTI \( g \) or G-CS-RNTI \( g \), is the total number of DCI formats scheduling PDSCH receptions, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, that the UE detects within the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \mathrm{PDCCH} \) monitoring occasions, respectively, for serving cell \( c . U_{\mathrm{DAL}, c}=0 \) or \( U_{\mathrm{DA}, c, g}=0 \) if the UE does not detect any DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, for serving cell \( c \) in any of the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \), respectively, PDCCH monitoring occasions.
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{TB}, \max }^{\mathrm{DL}}=2 \) if the value of maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI is 2 for any serving cell \( c \) and harq-ACKSpatialBundlingPUCCH is not provided; otherwise, \( N_{\mathrm{TB}, \max }^{\mathrm{DL}}=1 \).
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{TB}, \max , g}^{\mathrm{DL}}=2 \) if the value of maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI is 2 for any serving cell \( c \) and harq-ACKSpatialBundlingPUCCH is not provided for G-RNTI \( g \) or G-CS-RNTI \( g \); otherwise, \( N_{\mathrm{TB}, \max , g}^{\mathrm{DL}}=1 \).
- \( \quad N_{m, c}^{\text {received }} \) or \( N_{m, c, g}^{\text {received }} \), for G-RNTI \( g \) or G-CS-RNTI \( g \), is
- if harq-ACK-SpatialBundingPUCCH is not provided, the number of transport blocks the UE receives in a PDSCH, or the number of transport block groups in PDSCHs if numberOfHARQ-BundlingGroups with \( N_{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}}^{\mathrm{TBG}}=1 \) is provided, scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) for serving cell \( c \)
- else if harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH is provided, the number of PDSCHs, or the number of PDSCH groups if numberOfHARQ-BundlingGroups with \( N_{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}}^{\mathrm{TBG}}=1 \) is provided, scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) for serving cell \( c \)
- else, the number of DCI formats that the UE detects and have associated a HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) for serving cell \( c \).
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{SPS}, c} \) or \( N_{\mathrm{SPS}, c, g} \), for G-RNTI \( g \) or G-CS-RNTI \( g \), is the number of SPS PDSCH receptions by the UE on serving cell \( c \) for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the same PUCCH as for HARQACK information corresponding to PDSCH receptions within the \( M \) or \( M_{g} \) PDCCH monitoring occasions, respectively.

If a UE
- is provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission for \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {DLCBG }} \) serving cells; and
- is not provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission, for \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DLTB}} \) serving cells where \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mathrm{TB}}+N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mathrm{CBG}}= N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {DL }} \)
the UE determines the \( \tilde{o}_{0}^{A C K}, \tilde{o}_{1}^{A C K}, \cdots, \tilde{o}_{O_{\mathrm{ACK}}-1}^{A C K} \) according to the previous pseudo-code with the following modifications
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) is used for the determination of a first HARQ-ACK sub-codebook for
- SPS PDSCH reception,
