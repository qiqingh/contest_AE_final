An association pattern period includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PUSCH occasions with associated DMRS resources and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 640 msec . PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PUSCH transmissions.

\( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {SS/PBCH }} \) SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources in the following order
- first, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH occasion, where a DMRS resource index \( D M R S_{i d} \) is determined first in an ascending order of a DMRS port index and second in an ascending order of a DMRS sequence index [4, TS 38.211]
- second, in increasing order of PUSCH configuration period indexes

A PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap with a valid PRACH occasion as described in clause 8.1.
For unpaired spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or by ServingCellConfigCommon
- if a UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion
- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and
- starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2
- if a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion
- is within UL symbols
- starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last downlink symbol, and at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2

A UE determines a power of a PUSCH transmission as described in clause 7.1.1, where the UE obtains \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block with index associated with the PUSCH transmission.

A UE can be provided a USS set by sdt-CG-SearchSpace, or a CSS set by sdt-SearchSpace, to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI for scheduling PUSCH transmission or of DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI for scheduling PDSCH receptions [12, TS 38.331]. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions, the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDSCH receptions, and the SS/PBCH block associated with the PUSCH transmission are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi co-location 'type A ' or 'typeD' properties. The UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQACK information associated with the PDSCH receptions as described in clause 9.2.1 using a same spatial domain transmission filter as for the last PUSCH transmission.
