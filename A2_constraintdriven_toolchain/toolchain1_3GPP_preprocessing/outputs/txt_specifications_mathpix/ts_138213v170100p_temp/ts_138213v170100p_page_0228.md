The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions is defined as the PDCCH monitoring occasions in the active DL BWP of the configured serving cell, indexed in ascending order of start time of the associated search space sets. The cardinality of the set of PDCCH monitoring occasions defines a total number \( M \) of PDCCH monitoring occasions.

A value of a counter sidelink assignment indicator (SAI) field in DCI format 3.0 denotes an accumulative number of PDCCH monitoring occasions where PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions are scheduled, up to a current PDCCH monitoring occasion, in ascending order of PDCCH monitoring occasion index \( m \), where \( 0 \leq m<M \).

Denote by \( V_{C-\mathrm{SAl}, m}^{\mathrm{SL}} \) the value of the counter SAI in DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) according to Table 16.5.2.1-1.

If the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot \( n \), the UE determines the \( \tilde{o}_{0}^{A C K}, \tilde{o}_{1}^{A C K}, \ldots, \tilde{o}_{O_{\mathrm{ACK}}-1}^{A C K} \), for a total number of \( O_{\text {ACK }} \) HARQ-ACK information bits, according to the following pseudo-code:

Set \( m=0-\mathrm{PDCCH} \) with DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) monitoring occasion index: lower index corresponds to earlier PDCCH with DCI format 3_0 monitoring occasion

Set \( j=0 \)
Set \( V_{\text {temp }}=0 \)
Set \( V_{s}=\emptyset \)
Set \( M \) to the number of PDCCH monitoring occasions
while \( m<M \)
if PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) is before an active UL BWP change on the PCell
\( m=M ; \)
else
if there is a PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \)
if \( V_{C-\mathrm{SAl}, m}^{\mathrm{SL}} \leq V_{\text {temp }} \)
\( j=j+1 ; \)
end if
\( V_{\text {temp }}=V_{C-\mathrm{SAl}, m}^{\mathrm{SL}} \)
\( \tilde{o}_{4 j+V_{C-S A L, m-1}^{S L}}^{A C K}= \) HARQ-ACK information bit
\( V_{s}=V_{s} \cup\left\{4 j+V_{C-\mathrm{SA} 1, m}^{\mathrm{SL}}-1\right\} \)
end if
end if
\( m=m+1 ; \)
end while
\( O_{\text {ACK }}=4 \cdot j+V_{\text {temp }} \)
\( \tilde{o}_{i}^{A C K}=N A C K \) for any \( i \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, O_{A C K}-1\right\} \backslash V_{s} \)
if a SL configured grant Type 1 is configured for a UE, or a SL configured grant Type 2 is configured and activated for a UE, and the SL configured grant provides a grant for PSSCH transmissions with PSFCH reception occasions in a slot \( n-K_{1} \), where \( K_{1} \) is the PSFCH-to-HARQ-feedback timing value for the SL configured grant
