The UE does not expect to be provided both spsHARQdeferral and nrofSlots or PUCCH-nrofSlots for any PUCCH resource of same priority.
9.2.6 PUCCH repetition procedure

A UE can be indicated to transmit a PUCCH over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots using a PUCCH resource, where
- if the PUCCH resource is indicated by a DCI format and includes PUCCH-nrofSlots, \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) is provided by PUCCH-nrofSlots
- otherwise, \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) is provided by nrofSlots

If the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH, a slot for a PUCCH transmission with repetitions over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) slots includes a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH.

For \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \),
- the UE repeats the PUCCH transmission with the UCI over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots
- a repetition of the PUCCH transmission in each of the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots has a same number of consecutive symbols, as provided by nrofSymbols
- a repetition of the PUCCH transmission in each of the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots has a same first symbol, as provided by startingSymbollndex if subslotLengthForPUCCH is not provided; otherwise mod(startingSymbollndex, subslotLengthForPUCCH)
- the UE is configured by interslotFrequencyHopping whether or not to perform frequency hopping for repetitions of the PUCCH transmission in different slots
- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission across slots and the UE is not provided PUCCH-DMRS-Bundling = 'enabled'
- the UE performs frequency hopping per slot
- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by starting PRB, in slots with even number and starting from a second PRB , provided by secondHopPRB, in slots with odd number. The slot indicated to the UE for the first repetition of the PUCCH transmission has number 0 and each subsequent slot until the UE transmits the PUCCH in \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots is counted regardless of whether or not the UE transmits the PUCCH in the slot
- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping for a repetition of the PUCCH transmission within a slot
- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission across slots and the UE is provided PUCCH-DMRS-Bundling = 'enabled'
- the UE performs frequency hopping per interval of \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {interval }} \) consecutive slots, that start from a slot indicated to the UE and where the UE would transmit a first repetition of the PUCCH, where \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {interval }} \) is the value of PUCCH-Frequencyhopping-Interval, if provided; otherwise, \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {interval }} \) is the value of PUCCHTimeDomainWindowLength
- the UE transmits the PUCCH over intervals until the UE transmits the PUCCH in \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots, where the first interval has number 0 and each subsequent interval is counted regardless of whether or not the UE transmits the PUCCH in a slot
- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by starting \( P R B \), in intervals with even number and starting from a second PRB, provided by secondHopPRB, in intervals of frequency hopping intervals with odd number
- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping for a repetition of the PUCCH transmission within a slot
