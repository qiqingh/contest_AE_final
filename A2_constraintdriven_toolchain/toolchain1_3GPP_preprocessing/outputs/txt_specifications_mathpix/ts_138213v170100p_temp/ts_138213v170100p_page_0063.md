- if the UE would transmit the following channels that would overlap in time where, if a channel transmission is with repetitions, the following are applicable per repetition
- a first PUCCH transmission of larger priority index and a second PUCCH transmission of smaller priority index
- a first PUCCH transmission of larger priority index and a second PUSCH transmission of smaller priority index when the UE cannot simultaneously transmit the first PUCCH and second PUSCH
- a first PUCCH transmission of smaller priority index and a second PUSCH transmission of larger priority index when the UE cannot simultaneously transmit the first PUCCH and second PUSCH
the UE
- transmits the PUCCH or the PUSCH of the larger priority index, and
- does not transmit a PUCCH or a PUSCH of smaller priority index

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of different priority indexes, other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, before considering limitations for transmissions including with repetitions, if any, as described in clauses 11.1 and 11.1.1, if the UE is not provided UCI-MuxWithDifferentPriority, the UE first resolves overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority index as described in clauses 9.2.5 and 9.2.6. Then,
- if a transmission of a first PUCCH of larger priority index scheduled by a DCI format in a PDCCH reception would overlap in time with a repetition of a transmission of a second PUSCH or a second PUCCH of smaller priority index, the UE cancels the repetition of a transmission of the second PUSCH or the second PUCCH before the first symbol that would overlap with the first PUCCH transmission
- if a transmission of a first PUSCH of larger priority index scheduled by a DCI format in a PDCCH reception would overlap in time with a repetition of the transmission of a second PUCCH of smaller priority index, the UE cancels the repetition of the transmission of the second PUCCH before the first symbol that would overlap with the first PUSCH transmission
where
- the overlapping is applicable before or after resolving overlapping among channels of larger priority index, if any, as described in clauses 9.2.5 and 9.2.6
- any remaining PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmission after overlapping resolution is subjected to the limitations for UE transmission as described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1
- the UE expects that the transmission of the first PUCCH or the first PUSCH, respectively, would not start before \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) after a last symbol of the corresponding PDCCH reception
- \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for a corresponding UE processing capability assuming \( d_{2,1}=d_{1}[6, \mathrm{TS} \) 38.214], based on \( \mu \) and \( N_{2} \) as subsequently defined in this clause, and \( d_{1} \) is determined by a reported UE capability

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format in a first PDCCH reception to transmit a first PUCCH or a first PUSCH of larger priority index that overlaps with a second PUCCH or a second PUSCH transmission of smaller priority index that, if any, is scheduled by a DCI format in a second PDCCH
- \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is based on a value of \( \mu \) corresponding to the smallest SCS configuration of the first PDCCH, the second PDCCHs, the first PUCCH or the first PUSCH, and the second PUCCHs or the second PUSCHs
- if the overlapping group includes the first PUCCH
- if processingType2Enabled of PDSCH-ServingCellConfig is set to enable for the serving cell where the UE receives the first PDCCH and for all serving cells where the UE receives the PDSCHs corresponding to the second PUCCHs, and if processingType2Enabled of PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is set to enable for the serving cells with the second PUSCHs, \( N_{2} \) is 5 for \( \mu=0,5.5 \) for \( \mu=1 \) and 11 for \( \mu=2 \)
- else, \( N_{2} \) is 10 for \( \mu=0,12 \) for \( \mu=1,23 \) for \( \mu=2,36 \) for \( \mu=3,144 \) for \( \mu=5 \), and 288 for \( \mu=6 \);
