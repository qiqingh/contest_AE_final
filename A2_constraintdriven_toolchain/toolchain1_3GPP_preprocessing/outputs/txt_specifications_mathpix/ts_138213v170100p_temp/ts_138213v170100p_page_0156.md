- DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a MCS-C-RNTI scheduling \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r } 17} \) PUSCH transmissions for which the UE has not transmitted any corresponding PUSCH symbol over all \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {UL }} \) uplink cells.

If a UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r17monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability for any serving cell, is not configured for NR-DC operation, indicates a capability to monitor PDCCH candidates for \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap- } r 17} \geq 1 \) downlink cells and \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap- } r 17} \geq 1 \) downlink cells, and UE is configured with \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}}>1 \) downlink cell or \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{UL}}>1 \) uplink cells, the UE expects to have respectively received
