- alternates between the first and second spatial settings, or between the first and second sets of power control parameters, respectively, per \( N_{\mathrm{PUCCH}} \) switchetitions of the PUCCH transmission, where \( N_{\mathrm{PUCCH}}^{\text {switch }}=1 \) if mappingPattern \( = \) 'cyclicMapping'; else, \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {switch }}=2 \).

A UE does not expect a PUCCH that is in response to a DCI format detection to overlap with any other PUCCH that does not satisfy the corresponding timing conditions in clause 9.2.5.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots and the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots due to overlapping with another PUCCH transmission in the slot, the UE counts the slot in the number of \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots.

For DAPS operation, if a UE would transmit a PUCCH over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots on the source MCG and the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {rep eat }} \) slots due to overlapping in time with UE transmission on the target MCG in the slot, the UE counts the slot in the number of \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots.
9.3 UCI reporting in physical uplink shared channel

Offset values are defined for a UE to determine a number of resources for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and for multiplexing CSI reports in a PUSCH. Offset values are also defined for multiplexing CG-UCI [5, TS 38.212] in a CG-PUSCH. The offset values are signalled to a UE either by a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission or by higher layers.

If a DCI format that does not include a beta_offset indicator field schedules the PUSCH transmission from the UE and the UE is provided betaOffsets = 'semiStatic', the UE applies the \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }}, \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-1 }} \), and \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-2 }} \) values that are provided by betaOffsets = 'semiStatic' for the corresponding HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports. If the PUSCH transmission has priority 0 or priority 1 and the UE is configured by UCIMuxWithDifferentPriority to multiplex HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0 , respectively, and if the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0 , the UE applies corresponding \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK } 1} \) or \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }, 0} \) provided by betaOffset-CrossPril = 'semiStatic' for DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 0 \_1 \) and by betaOffsetsCrossPriIDCI-0-2 = 'semiStatic' for DCI format 0_2, or by betaOffset-CrossPri0 = 'semiStatic' for DCI format \( 0-1 \) and by betaOffsetsCrossPri0DCI-0-2 = 'semiStatic' for DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), respectively.

If the PUSCH transmission is with a configured grant and the UE is provided CG-UCI-OnPUSCH='semiStatic', the UE applies the \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARR-ACK }}, \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-1 }} \), and \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-2 }} \) values that are provided by CG-UCI-OnPUSCH = 'semiStatic' for the corresponding HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports. If the PUSCH transmission has priority 0 or priority 1 and the UE is configured by UCI-Mux WithDifferentPriority to multiplex HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0 , respectively, and if the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0 , the UE applies corresponding \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }, 1} \) or \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }, 0} \) provided by CG-betaOffsetsCrossPril \( = \) 'semiStatic' or CG-betaOffsetsCrossPri0 = 'semiStatic', respectively.

If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and the UE is provided betaOffsets = 'dynamic', the UE applies the \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }}, \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-1 }} \), and \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {CSI-2 }} \) values that are determined from the first value of betaOffsets \( = \) 'dynamic'. If the UE is configured by UCI-MuxWithDifferentPriority to multiplex HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 , the UE applies corresponding \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK } 1} \) provided by the first value of betaOffset-CrossPril = 'dynamic'.

If the PUSCH transmission is a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH and the UE is provided CG-UCI-OnPUSCH \( = \) 'dynamic', the UE applies the \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}}, \beta_{\mathrm{offset}}^{\mathrm{CSI}-1} \), and \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\mathrm{CSI}-2} \) values that are determined from the first value of \( C G \) -UCI-OnPUSCH = 'dynamic'. If the PUSCH transmission has priority 0 or priority 1 and the UE is configured by UCIMuxWithDifferentPriority to multiplex HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0, respectively, and if the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of priority 1 or priority 0 , the UE applies corresponding \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK } 1} \) or \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK, } 0} \) provided by the first value of CG-betaOffsetsCrossPril = 'dynamic' or CG-betaOffsetsCrossPrio = 'dynamic', respectively.

HARQ-ACK information offsets \( \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \) are configured to values according to Table 9.3-1. The betaOffsetACKIndex 1, betaOffsetACK-Index2, and betaOffsetACK-Index3 respectively provide indexes \( I_{\text {offset }, 0}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \), \( I_{\text {offset }, 1}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \), and \( I_{\text {offset } 2}^{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \) for the UE to use if the UE multiplexes up to 2 HARQ-ACK information bits, more than 2 and up to 11 HARQ-ACK information bits, and more than 11 bits in the PUSCH, respectively.
