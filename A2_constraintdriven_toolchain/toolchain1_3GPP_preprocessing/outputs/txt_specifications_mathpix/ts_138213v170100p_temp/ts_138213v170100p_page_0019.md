If a UE is provided TCI-State_r17 indicating a unified TCI state for the PCell or the PSCell [6, TS 38.214], after X symbols from a last symbol of a first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld where the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, the UE
- if AdditionalPCIInfo is not provided, monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs, and receives PDSCH and aperiodic CSI-RS in a resource from a CSI-RS resource set with same indicated TCI state as for the PDCCH and PDSCH, using the same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the ones associated with the corresponding index \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any
- transmits PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS that uses a same spatial domain filter with same indicated TCI state as for the PUCCH and the PUSCH, using a same spatial domain filter as for the last PRACH transmission

For the remaining of this clause, if a PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two linked search space sets based on searchSpaceLinking, as described in clause 10.1, the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is the last symbol of the PDCCH candidate that ends later. The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10, 11.1, and 11.1.1.

For the PCell or the PSCell, if BFR MAC CE [11, TS 38.321] is provided in Msg3 or MsgA of contention based random access procedure, and if a PUCCH resource is provided with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, after 28 symbols from the last symbol of the PDCCH reception that determines the completion of the contention based random access procedure as described in clause 5.1.4a or in clause 5.1.5 of [11, TS38.321], the UE transmits the PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using
- a same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission
- a power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with \( q_{u}=0, q_{d}=q_{\text {new }} \), and \( l=0 \), where \( q_{\text {new }} \) is the SS/PBCH block index selected for the last PRACH transmission.

If a UE is provided TCI-State_r17 indicating a unified TCI state for the PCell or the PSCell and the UE provides BFR MAC CE in Msg3 or MsgA of contention based random access procedure, after X symbols from the last symbol of the PDCCH reception that determines the completion of the contention based random access procedure as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE
- if AdditionalPCIInfo is not provided, monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs, and receives PDSCH and aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set with same indicated TCI state as for the PDCCH and PDSCH using the same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the ones associated with the corresponding index \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any
- transmits PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS that uses a same spatial domain filter with same indicated TCI state as for the PUCCH and PUSCH, using a same spatial domain filter as for the last PRACH transmission

A UE can be provided, by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.24 for the UE to transmit PUCCH [11, TS 38.321]. If the PCell or the PSCell is associated with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \), and with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \), the UE can be provided by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for PUCCH transmission with a LRR. If the UE is provided only the first configuration, the UE transmits a PUCCH with LRR for either set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \). If the UE is provided both the first and second configurations, the UE uses the first configuration to transmt a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and the second configuration to transmit a PUCCH with LRR associated with set \( \bar{q}_{0,1}[11 \), TS 38.321].

The UE can provide in a first PUSCH MAC CE index(es) for at least corresponding SCell(s) with radio link quality worse than \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }, \mathrm{LR}} \), indication(s) of presence of \( q_{\text {new }} \) for corresponding SCell(s), and index(es) \( q_{\text {new }} \) for a periodic CSIRS configuration or for a SS/PBCH block provided by higher layers, as described in [11, TS 38.321], if any, for corresponding SCell(s). After 28 symbols from a last symbol of a PDCCH reception with a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same HARQ process number as for the transmission of the first PUSCH and having a toggled NDI field value, the UE
- monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs on the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC CE using the same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the ones associated with the corresponding index(es) \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any
- transmits PUCCH on a PUCCH-SCell using a same spatial domain filter as the one corresponding to \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any, for periodic CSI-RS or SS/PBCH block reception, as described in clause 9.2.2, and using a power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with \( q_{\mathrm{u}}=0, q_{\mathrm{d}}=q_{\text {new }} \), and \( l=0 \), if
