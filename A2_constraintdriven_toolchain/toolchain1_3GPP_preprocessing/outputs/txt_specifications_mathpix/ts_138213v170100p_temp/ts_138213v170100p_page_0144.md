each with same activated tci-StatelD value, to CORESETs with a same index in all configured DL BWPs of all configured cells in a list determined from a serving cell index, where one or two tci-StateID, the CORESET index, and the serving cell index are provided by a MAC CE command.

For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE is provided by higher layers with \( S \leq 10 \) search space sets where, for each search space set from the \( S \) search space sets, the UE is provided the following by SearchSpace:
- a search space set index \( s, 0<s<40 \), by searchSpaceld
- an association between the search space set \( s \) and a CORESET \( p \) by controlResourceSetld or by controlResourceSetld-v1610
- a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of \( k_{s} \) slots and a PDCCH monitoring offset of \( o_{s} \) slots, by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset or by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17
- a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s) of the CORESET for PDCCH monitoring within each slot where the UE monitors PDCCH, by monitoringSymbols WithinSlot
- a duration of \( T_{s}<k_{s} \) indicating a number of slots that the search space set \( s \) exists by duration, or a number of slots in consecutive groups of slots where the search space set \( s \) can exist by duration-r 17
- a bitmap, by monitoringSlots WithinSlotGroup, that applies per group of slots and provides a PDCCH monitoring pattern indicating slots in a group of slots for PDCCH monitoring
- a size of the group of slots is same as a size of monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup
- for a Type1-PDCCH CSS set provided by ra-SearchSpace in dedicated RRC signaling, or for a Type3PDCCH CSS set, or for a USS set, the PDCCH monitoring pattern indicates only consecutive slots in the group of slots for PDCCH monitoring and, at least for one combination ( \( X_{s}, Y_{s} \) ) indicated by the UE as a capability, a number of the consecutive slots is not larger than \( Y_{s} \)
- a number of PDCCH candidates \( M_{s}^{(L)} \) per CCE aggregation level \( L \) by aggregationLevell, aggregationLevel2, aggregationLevel4, aggregationLevel8, and aggregationLevell6, for CCE aggregation level 1, CCE aggregation level 2, CCE aggregation level 4, CCE aggregation level 8, and CCE aggregation level 16, respectively
- an indication that search space set \( S \) is either a CSS set or a USS set by searchSpaceType
- if search space set \( s \) is a CSS set
- an indication by dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and DCI format 1_0
- an indication by dci-Format2-0 to monitor one or two PDCCH candidates, or to monitor one PDCCH candidate per RB set if the UE is provided freqMonitorLocations for the search space set, for DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) and a corresponding CCE aggregation level
- an indication by dci-Format2-1 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_1
- an indication by dci-Format2-2 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_2
- an indication by dci-Format2-3 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_3
- an indication by dci-Format2-4 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_4
- an indication by dci-Format2-6 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2 _6
- an indication by dci-Format4-0 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 4 \_0 \)
- an indication by dci-Format4-1, or dci-Format4-2, or dci-Format4-1-AndFormat4-2 to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 4 \_1 \), or DCI format \( 4 \_2 \), or for both DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 4 \_2 \), respectively
- a search space set index by searchSpaceLinking for another search space set that is linked to search space set \( s \)
- if search space set \( s \) is a USS set, an indication by dci-Formats to monitor PDCCH candidates either for DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), or for DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 1 \_1 \), or an indication by dci-FormatsExt
