- if, for a resource pool, typeAUEScheme 2 is disabled, the first UE has been indicated a first reserved resource and a second reserved resource as resources for PSSCH reception or, if for a resource pool typeAUEScheme 2 is enabled, has been indicated at least the first reserved resource or the second reserved resource for PSSCH reception,
- detects a first SCI format 1 - A that includes a first priority value, \( p_{1} \), and the first reserved resource for PSSCH transmission from a second UE,
- detects a second SCI format 1 -A that includes a second priority value, \( p_{2}<p_{1} \), and the second reserved resource for PSSCH transmission from a third UE, and
- determines that the first and second resources overlap in time and frequency
- the PSFCH occasions for resource conflict information of the second UE and the third UE are valid
- the indicationUEB flag in SCI Format 1-A from the second UE and the third UE is set to 1 , if indicationUEBScheme2 = 'enabled'
- determines the first SCI format 1 - A and the second SCI format 1 - A are not received later than \( s / \) MinTimeGapPSFCH before the PSFCH occasion for conflict information
- determines to transmit to the second UE the PSFCH with the conflict information
- determines to transmit to either the second UE or the third UE the PSFCH with the conflict information, if \( p_{2}= p_{1} \)

The first UE can be provided conditions by optionForCondition2A1Scheme2 to determine conflict of reserved resources in a resource pool
- if optionForCondition2A1Scheme2 = 'RSRP-ThresPerPriorities', the first UE can be provided by, ThresPSSCH-RSRP-List \( T h\left(p_{i}, p_{j}\right) \), a list of RSRP thresholds for each priority combination \( \left(p_{i}, p_{j}\right)[6 \), TS 38.214]
- if the first UE is an intended receiver for PSSCH in a reserved resource of the second UE, the first UE determines a resource conflict if the \( \operatorname{RSRP}[6, \operatorname{TS} 38.214] \) of the third UE is above a threshold \( \operatorname{Th}\left(p_{2}, p_{1}\right) \)
- if the first UE is an intended receiver for PSSCH in a reserved resource of the third UE, the first UE determines a resource conflict if the RSRP of the second UE is above a threshold \( \operatorname{Th}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}\right) \)
- if optionForCondition2A1Scheme2 = 'RSRP-ThresWithRsrpMeasurement', the first UE can be provided a value Delta_Th by deltaRSRPThresh
- if the first UE is an intended receiver for PSSCH in a reserved resource of the second UE, the first UE determines a resource conflict if \( R S R P_{2}>R S R P_{1}+ \) Delta_Th, where \( R S R P_{1} \) and \( R S R P_{2} \) are the RSRP measurements from the first UE for the second UE and the third UE, respectively
- if the first UE is an intended receiver for PSSCH in a reserved resource of the third UE, the first UE determines a resource conflict if \( R S R P_{1}>R S R P_{2}+ \) Delta_Th

If a UE transmits a PSFCH with conflict information corresponding to a reserved resource indicated in an SCI format 1A, the UE transmits the PSFCH in the resource pool in a slot determined based on PSFCHOccasionScheme 2
- If PSFCHOccasionScheme2 = 'followSCI', the UE transmits the PSFCH in a first slot that includes PSFCH resources and is at least a number of slots, provided by s/-MinTimeGapPSFCH, of the resource pool after a slot of a PSCCH reception that provides the SCI format 1-A. The PSFCH resource is in a slot that is at least \( T_{3} \) slots [6, TS 38.214] before the resource associated with the conflict information; otherwise, the UE does not transmit the PSFCH with conflict information.
- If PSFCHOccasionScheme2 = 'follow ReservedResource', the UE transmits the PSFCH in a latest slot that includes PSFCH resources and is at least \( T_{3} \) slots before a slot of the resource associated with conflict information. The PSFCH resource is in a slot that is at least s/-MinTimeGapPSFCH slots after a slot of a PSCCH reception that provides the SCI format 1-A; otherwise, the UE does not transmit the PSFCH with conflict information.
