A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH release after \( N \) symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release. If processingType2Enabled of PDSCH-ServingCellConfig is set to enable for the serving cell with the PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release, \( N=5 \) for \( \mu=0, N=5.5 \) for \( \mu=1 \), and \( N=11 \) for \( \mu=2 \), otherwise, \( N=10 \) for \( \mu=0, N=12 \) for \( \mu=1, N=22 \) for \( \mu=2, N=25 \) for \( \mu=3 \), \( N=100 \) for \( \mu=5 \), and \( N=200 \) for \( \mu=6 \), wherein \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH carrying the HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH release.
10.2A PDCCH validation for SL configured grant Type 2

A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a SL configured grant Type 2 PDCCH if
- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) is scrambled with a SL-CS-RNTI provided by sl-CS-RNTI, and
- the new data indicator field in the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for the enabled transport block is set to ' 0 '

Validation of the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) is achieved if all fields for the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) are set according to Table 10.2A-1 or Table 10.2A-2.

If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) as a valid activation or valid release of SL configured grant Type 2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the information in the DCI format 3_0.
