scheduling the PSSCH transmissions or on the value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format 3_0 activating a SL configured grant Type 2 transmission, or
- has not been provided PSSCH resources with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions that the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information based on the value of sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel for a SL configured grant Type 1, in any of the set \( M_{A} \) of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions, as described in clause 16.5.1.1,
the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission;
- else the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.1.1, unless the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for
- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions corresponding to a SL configured grant, or
- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that are scheduled by DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) with a counter SAI field value of 1 in the set \( M_{A} \) of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions,
in which case the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for the PSFCH reception occasions as described in clause 16.5.1.

A UE sets to NACK value in the HARQ-ACK codebook any HARQ-ACK information corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI format 3.0 that the UE detects in a PDCCH monitoring occasion that starts after a PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission.

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.1.1 when a value of the SAI field in the DCI format is \( V_{T-S A I}^{U L}=1 \). The UE does not generate a HARQ-ACK codebook for multiplexing in the PUSCH transmission when \( V_{T-\text { SAI }}^{\mathrm{UL}}=0 \) unless the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for
- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions corresponding to a SL configured grant, or
- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that are scheduled by a DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) with a counter SAI field value of 1 in the set \( M_{A} \) of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions as described in clause 16.5.1.
\( V_{T-\text { SAI }}^{\mathrm{UL}}=0 \) if the SAI field in the DCI format is set to ' 0 '; otherwise, \( V_{T-\text { SAI }}^{\mathrm{UL}}=1 \).
16.5.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination

This clause applies if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook \( = \) dynamic.
16.5.2.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions on an active DL BWP of a serving cell \( c \), as described in clause 10.1, and for which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in slot \( n \) based on
- PSFCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values, or a value provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CGTypel, for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) in response to PSFCH receptions;
- time gap field in DCI format 3_0 for scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions;
- time resource assignment in DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions;
- a configured sidelink resource pool bitmap;
- a value of a period of PSFCH resources provided in sl-PSFCH-Period;
- a value of a minimum time gap provided in sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH.
