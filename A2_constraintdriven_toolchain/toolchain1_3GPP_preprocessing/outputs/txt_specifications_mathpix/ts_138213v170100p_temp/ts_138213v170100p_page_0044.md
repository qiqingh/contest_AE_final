- if \( \hat{P}_{\mathrm{MCG}}\left(i_{1}\right)+\hat{P}_{\mathrm{SCG}}\left(i_{2}\right)>\hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {NE-DC }} \) in any portion of slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG,
the UE reduces transmission power in any portion of slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG so that \( \hat{P}_{\text {MCG }}\left(i_{1}\right)+\hat{P}_{\text {SCG }}\left(i_{2}\right) \leq \hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {NE-DC }} \) in all portions of slot \( i_{1} \), where \( \hat{P}_{\text {MCG }}\left(i_{1}\right) \) and \( \hat{P}_{\text {SCG }}\left(i_{2}\right) \) are the linear values of the total UE transmission powers in slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG in FR1 and in subframe \( i_{2} \) of the SCG, respectively.
- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC, the UE expects to be configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA (by tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r 15 in [13, TS 36.213]).
7.6.2 NR-DC

If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2 and with a SCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively, the UE performs transmission power control independently per cell group as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 .

If a UE is configured with an MCG and a SCG using NR radio access in FR1 and/or in FR2, the UE is configured a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{MCG}} \) for transmissions on the MCG by \( p-N R-F R 1 \) and/or by \( p-N R-F R 2 \) and a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{SCG}} \) for transmissions on the SCG by \( p-N R-F R I \) and/or by \( p-N R-F R 2 \) and with an inter-CG power sharing mode by nrdc-PCmode-FR1 for FR1 and/or by nrdc-PCmode-FR2 for FR2. The UE determines a transmission power on the MCG and a transmission power on the SCG per frequency range.

If a UE is provided semi-static-model for nrdc-PCmode-FRI or for nrdc-PCmode-FR2, or semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FRI or for nrdc-PCmode-FR2, the UE does not expect \( P_{\text {MCG }} \) and \( P_{\text {SCG }} \) to be configured such that \( \hat{P}_{\text {MCG }}+ \widehat{P}_{\text {SCG }}>\widehat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{N R-D C} \), where \( \widehat{P}_{\text {MCG }} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\text {MCG }}, \widehat{P}_{S C G} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\text {SCG }} \), and \( \widehat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{N R-D C} \) is the linear value of a configured maximum transmission power for NR-DC operation in FR1 or FR2 as defined in [8-3, TS 38.101-3].

If a UE is provided semi-static-model for nrdc-PCmode-FR1 or for nadc-PCmode-FR2, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG or for the SCG as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using \( P_{\text {MCG }} \) or \( P_{\text {SCG }} \) as the maximum transmission power, respectively.

If a UE is provided semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1 or for nrdc-PCmode-FR2
- if the UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the MCG or SCG, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG or for the SCG as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using \( P_{\text {MCG }} \) or \( P_{\text {SCG }} \) as the maximum transmission power, respectively
- if at least one symbol of slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG or of the SCG that is indicated as uplink or flexible to a UE by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, if provided, overlaps with a symbol for any ongoing transmission overlapping with slot \( i_{2} \) of the SCG or of the MCG, respectively, the UE determines a power for the transmission on the SCG or the MCG overlapping with slot \( i_{2} \) as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using \( P_{\text {SCG }} \) or \( P_{\text {MCG }} \), respectively, as the maximum transmission power
- otherwise, the UE determines a power for the transmission on SCG or the MCG overlapping with slot \( i_{2} \), as described in [8-3, TS 38.101-3] and in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 without considering \( P_{\text {SCG }} \) or \( P_{\text {MCG }} \) respectively

The UE expects to be provided semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FRI or for nadc-PCmode-FR2 only for synchronous NR-DC operation [10, TS 38.133].

If a UE
- is provided dynamic for nrdc-PCmode-FRI or for nrdc-PCmode-FR2, and
- indicates a capability to support dynamic power sharing for intra-FR NR DC,
the UE determines a maximum transmission power on the SCG at a first symbol of a transmission occasion on the SCG by determining transmissions on the MCG that
- are scheduled by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last symbol that is earlier by at least \( T_{\text {off set }} \) from the first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG, or are configured by higher layers, and
- overlap with the transmission occasion on the SCG
