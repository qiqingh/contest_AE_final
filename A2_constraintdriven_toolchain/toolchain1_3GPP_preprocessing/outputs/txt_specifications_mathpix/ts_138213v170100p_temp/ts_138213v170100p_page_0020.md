3GPP TS 38.213 version 17.1.0 Release 17
19
ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo for the PUCCH,
- a PUCCH with the LRR was either not transmitted or was transmitted on the PCell or the PSCell, and
- the PUCCH-SCell is included in the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC-CE
where the SCS configuration for the 28 symbols is the smallest of the SCS configurations of the active DL BWP for the PDCCH reception and of the active DL BWP(s) of the at least one SCell.

If a UE is provided TCI-State_r 17 indicating a unified TCI state, after X symbols from a last symbol of a PDCCH reception with a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same HARQ process number as for the transmission of the first PUSCH and having a toggled NDI field value, the UE
- monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs, and receives PDSCH and aperiodic CSI-RS in a resource from a CSI-RS resource set using the same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the ones associated with the corresponding index \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any
- transmits PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS that uses a same spatial domain filter with same indicated TCI state as for the PUCCH and PUSCH, using a same spatial domain filter as the one corresponding to \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any

For serving cells associated with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \), and with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \), the UE can provide in a second PUSCH MAC CE index(es) for cell(s) with \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and/or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) having radio link quality worse than \( \mathrm{Q}_{\text {out }, \mathrm{LR}} \), the index(es) of those \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and/or \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \), and indication(s) of presence of \( q_{\text {new }} \) and of index(es) \( q_{\text {new }} \), if any, from corresponding sets \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \) and/or \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \) for the serving cells.

For serving cells associated with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,0} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \), and with sets \( \bar{q}_{0,1} \) and \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \), and having radio link quality worse than Qout,LR, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of a first PDCCH reception with a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same HARQ process number as for transmission of the second PUSCH and having a toggled NDI field value, the UE assumes antenna port quasi-collocation parameters
- corresponding to \( q_{\text {new }} \) from \( \bar{q}_{1,0} \), if any, for the first CORESETs,
- corresponding to \( q_{\text {new }} \) from \( \bar{q}_{1,1} \), if any, for the second CORESETs
where the SCS configuration for the 28 symbols is the smallest of the SCS configurations of the active DL BWP for the PDCCH reception and of the active \( \mathrm{DL} \mathrm{BWP}(\mathrm{s}) \) of the serving cells.

7 Uplink Power control
Uplink power control determines a power for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH transmissions.
A UE does not expect to simultaneously maintain more than four pathloss estimates per serving cell for all PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions as described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1, except for SRS transmissions configured by SRS-PosResourceSet as described in clause 7.3.1. If the UE is provided a number of RS resources for pathloss estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions that is larger than 4, the UE maintains for pathloss estimation RS resources corresponding to RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \) as described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1. If an RS resource updated by MAC CE, as described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, is one from the RS resources the UE maintains for pathloss estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions, the UE applies the pathloss estimation based on the RS resources starting from the first slot that is after slot \( k+3 \cdot N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu}+2^{\mu} \cdot k_{\text {mac }} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH or PUSCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE, \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH or PUSCH, respectively, that is determined in the slot when the MAC CE command is applied and \( k_{\text {mac }} \) is a number of slots for SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \) provided by \( K \)-Mac or \( k_{\text {mac }}=0 \) if \( K \) Mac is not provided.

A PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS/PRACH transmission occasion \( i \) is defined by a slot index \( n_{s, f}^{\mu} \) within a frame with system frame number \( S F N \), a first symbol \( S \) within the slot, and a number of consecutive symbols \( L \). For a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type B, a PUSCH transmission occasion is a nominal repetition [6, TS 38.214].

In the remaining of this clause, if a UE is provided DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIstate and for an indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIstate as described in [6, TS 38.214]
