10.4A PDCCH monitoring for early indication of paging

A UE can be provided the following for detection of a DCI format 2_7 in RRC_IDLE state or in RRC_INACTIVE state [12, TS 38.331]
- a search space set, by peiSearchSpace, to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_7 according to a Type2A-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 10.1
- a number of frames, by \( P E I-F \) offset, from the start of a first paging frame of paging frames associated with a number of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI format 2 _ 7 [17, TS 38.304] to the start of a frame
- a number of symbols, by firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O, from the start of the frame to the start of the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2_7
- a size, by payloadSizeDCI_format2_7
- a number of subgroups per paging occasion, \( N_{\mathrm{SG}}^{\mathrm{PO}} \), by subgroupsNumPerPO
- a number of paging occasions associated with the number of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI format 2_7, \( N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}} \), by PONumPerPEI

A paging indication field of DCl format 2_7 includes \( N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}} \) segments of \( K \) bits, where \( K=N_{\mathrm{SG}}^{\mathrm{PO}} \) if \( N_{\mathrm{SG}}^{\mathrm{PO}}>0 \) and \( K=1 \) if \( N_{\mathrm{SG}}^{\mathrm{PO}} \) is not provided. For a subgroup index \( i_{S G}, 0 \leq i_{S G}<K \), a UE determines a value for the \( \left(i_{P O} \cdot K+i_{S G}\right) \) bit in the paging indication field, where \( i_{P O}=\left(\left(\mathrm{UE} \_\mathrm{ID} \bmod N\right) \cdot N_{S}+i_{S}\right) \bmod N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}} \) is a paging occasion index, and UE_ID, \( N, N_{S} \), \( i_{S G} \), and \( i_{S} \) are defined in [17, TS 38.304]. When the value is ' 1 ', the UE monitors a paging occasion determined according to [17, TS 38.304]; otherwise, the UE is not required to monitor the paging occasion.

If \( N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}}<N_{S} \), the number of symbols from the start of the frame to the start of the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format \( 2-7 \) that is associated with paging occasion index \( i_{P O} \) is the \( \left(\left\lfloor i_{S} / N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}}\right\rfloor+1\right) \)-th value from the \( N_{S} / N_{\mathrm{PO}}^{\mathrm{PEI}} \) values provided by firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O.
10.4B Indication of TRS resources

A UE in RRC_IDLE state or RRC_INACTIVE state can be provided by TRS-ResourceSetConfig a set of TRS occasions [6, TS 38.214]. If TRS-ResourceSetConfig is provided, a DCI format 2 _ 7 , if peiSearchSpace is provided, and a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by P-RNTI includes a TRS availability indication field [4, TS 38.212] that provides a bitmap to groups of TRS resource sets where the configuration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit of the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a multiple, by validityDuration, for a number of frames provided by defaultPagingCycle for TRS resource sets with indicated presence; if validityDuration is not provided, the multiple is equal to 2 .

A value of ' 1 ' for a bit of the bitmap indicates presence of associated TRS resource sets for the multiple of the number of frames, starting from a SFN determined from (SFN + PF_offset) \( \bmod T=0[17, \mathrm{TS} 38.304] \) that corresponds to the frame that includes a PDCCH providing the DCI format 2_7, or the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by P-RNTI, with the TRS availability indication field indicating the TRS resource sets, where \( T \) is provided by defaultPagingCycleA value of ' 0 ' for a bit of the bitmap indicates no change to a current assumption for the availability or unavailability of associated TRS resource sets.

A UE can receive first and second PDCCHs that provide DCI format 2_7 or DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by PRNTI that indicate presence of TRS resource sets for the multiple of the number of frames, where the second PDCCH reception after the first PDCCH reception by a time that is smaller than the multiple of the number of frames.
10.5 HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions

A UE can be configured a number of search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) with a DFI flag field and CRC scrambled with a CS-RNTI provided by \( c s-R N T I \). The UE determines that the DCI format provides HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions based on when a DFI flag field value is set to '1', if a PUSCH transmission is configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig.
