- is configured for operation with carrier aggregation, and
- indicates support of search space sharing through searchSpaceSharingCA-UL or through searchSpaceSharingCA-DL, and
- has a PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level \( L \) in CORESET \( p \) associated with search space set \( s_{i} \) for detection of a first DCI format, other than DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), having a first size and scheduling
- PUSCH transmission or configured grant Type 2 PUSCH release on serving cell \( n_{C I, 2} \), or
- PDSCH reception or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception on serving cell \( n_{C I, 2} \)
can receive a corresponding PDCCH through a PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level \( L \) in CORESET \( p \) associated with search space set \( s_{j} \) for detection of a second DCI format having a second size and associated with scheduling on serving cell \( n_{C I, 1} \) if the first size and the second size are same and if neither of search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) includes searchSpaceLinking.

A UE expects to monitor PDCCH candidates for up to 4 sizes of DCI formats that include up to 3 sizes of DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI per serving cell. The UE counts a number of sizes for DCI formats per serving cell based on a number of configured PDCCH candidates in respective search space sets for the corresponding active DL BWP.

A UE does not expect to detect, in a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SIRNTI, RA-RNTI, MsgB-RNTI, TC-RNTI, P-RNTI, C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI, G-RNTI, or G-CS-RNTI and a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SL-RNTI or a SL-CS-RNTI for scheduling respective PDSCH reception and PSSCH transmission on a same serving cell.

A PDCCH candidate with index \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) for a search space set \( s_{j} \) using a set of \( L \) CCEs in a CORESET \( p \) on the active DL BWP for serving cell \( n_{C I} \) is not counted for monitoring if there is a PDCCH candidate with index \( m_{s_{i,} n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) for a search space set \( s_{i}<s_{j} \), or if there is a PDCCH candidate with index \( n_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) and \( n_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)}<m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \), in the CORESET \( p \) on the active DL BWP for serving cell \( n_{C I} \) using a same set of \( L \) CCEs, the PDCCH candidates have identical scrambling, and the corresponding DCI formats for the PDCCH candidates have a same size; otherwise, the PDCCH candidate with index \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I}}^{(L)} \) is counted for monitoring.

For search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) that include searchSpaceLinking with values \( s_{j} \) and \( s_{i} \), and for search space set \( s_{k} \) that does not include searchSpaceLinking, when a UE
- monitors PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(L)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(L)} \) for detection of a first DCI format,
- monitors PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k} n C_{I, 2}}^{(L)} \) for detection of a second DCI format having a same size as the first DCI format,
- the PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{i} n_{C I, 1}}^{(L)} \), or the PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(L)} \), and the PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(L)} \) have identical scrambling and use a same set of CCEs over same symbols in a slot in a CORESET \( p \),
the PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(L)} \) is not counted for monitoring and the UE assumes that a detected DCI format is the first DCI format. A UE may monitor PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(L)} \) depending on a corresponding capability [16, TS 38.306].

For search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) that include searchSpaceLinking with values \( s_{j} \) and \( s_{i} \), and for search space set \( s_{k} \) that does not include searchSpaceLinking, when a UE
- monitors PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(8)} \) for detection of a first DCI format and monitors PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k} n_{C I, 2}}^{(16)} \) for detection of a second DCI format, or monitors PDCCH candidates \( m_{s_{i} n_{C I, 1}}^{(16)}=m_{s_{j}, n_{C I, 1}}^{(16)} \) for detection of the first DCI format and monitors PDCCH candidate \( m_{s_{k}, n_{C I, 2}}^{(8)} \) for detection of the second DCI format, and
