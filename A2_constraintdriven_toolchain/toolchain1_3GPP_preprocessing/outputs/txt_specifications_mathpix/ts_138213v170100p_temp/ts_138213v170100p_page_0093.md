9.1.3.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include a DAI field, then
- if the UE has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for DCI formats scheduling PDSCH receptions, or providing a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, on any serving cell \( c \) and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS
