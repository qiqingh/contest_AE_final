If a UE multiplexes aperiodic CSI in a PUSCH and the UE would multiplex UCI that includes HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH that overlaps with the PUSCH and the timing conditions for overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in clause 9.2.5 are fulfilled, the UE multiplexes only the HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH and does not transmit the PUCCH.

If a UE transmits multiple PUSCHs in a slot on respective serving cells that include first PUSCHs that are scheduled by DCI formats and second PUSCHs configured by respective ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, and the UE would multiplex UCI in one of the multiple PUSCHs, and the multiple PUSCHs fulfil the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing, the UE multiplexes the UCI in a PUSCH from the first PUSCHs.

If a UE transmits multiple PUSCHs in a slot on respective serving cells and the UE would multiplex UCI in one of the multiple PUSCHs and the UE does not multiplex aperiodic CSI in any of the multiple PUSCHs, the UE multiplexes the UCI in a PUSCH of the serving cell with the smallest ServCelllndex subject to the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing being fulfilled. If the UE transmits more than one PUSCHs in the slot on the serving cell with the smallest ServCellIndex that fulfil the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing, the UE multiplexes the UCI in the earliest PUSCH that the UE transmits in the slot.

If a UE transmits a PUSCH over multiple slots and the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information over a single slot that overlaps with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots of the multiple slots, and the PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots fulfills the conditions in clause 9.2 .5 for multiplexing the HARQACK and/or CSI information, the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots. The UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the PUSCH transmission in a slot from the multiple slots if the UE would not transmit a single-slot PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the slot in case the PUSCH transmission was absent.

If a UE transmits a PUSCH with repetition Type B and the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information over a single slot that overlaps with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots, the UE expects all actual repetitions of the PUSCH transmission [6, TS 38.214] that would overlap with the PUCCH transmission to fulfill the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information, and the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the earliest actual PUSCH repetition of the PUSCH transmission that would overlap with the PUCCH transmission and includes more than one symbol. The UE does not expect that all actual repetitions that would overlap with the PUCCH transmission do not include more than one symbol.

If the PUSCH transmission over the multiple slots is scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field, the value of the DAI field is applicable for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission in any slot from the multiple slots where the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information.

When a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is configured by a ConfiguredGrantConfig, and includes CG-UCI [5, TS 38.212], the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission if the UE is provided cg-UCI-Multiplexing; otherwise, if the HARQ-ACK information and the PUSCH have same priority index, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH and multiplexes the HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission or in another PUSCH transmission; if the HARQ-ACK information and the PUSCH have different priority indexes, the UE does not transmit the channel with the smaller priority index.

In the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats. Corresponding unicast DCI formats are DCI formats \( 0 \_0 / 0 \_1 / 0 \_2 / 1 \_0 / 1 \_1 / 1 \_2 \) and multicast DCI formats are DCI formats 4_1/4_2 [4, TS 38.212]. PDSCH receptions scheduled by unicast or multicast DCI formats or HARQACK information associated with unicast or multicast DCI formats are also respectively referred as unicast or multicast PDSCH receptions or unicast or multicast HARQ-ACK information.

For the remaining of this clause, if a UE is provided \( K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) by CellSpecific_Koffset or \( K_{\text {UE }, \text { offset }} \) by a MAC CE command, reference to a slot \( n+k \) for a PUCCH transmission or PUSCH transmission corresponds to a slot \( n+k+ 2^{\mu-\mu_{K_{0}}} \) ffset \( \cdot K_{\text {offset }} \) for the PUSCH or the PUCCH transmission, where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH transmission or PUSCH transmission, \( K_{\text {offset }} \) is defined in clause 4.2, and \( \mu_{K_{\text {offset }}}=0 \) in FR1. If Koffset or if the MAC CE command is not provided, \( K_{\text {cell, offset }}=0 \) or \( K_{\mathrm{UE}, \text { offset }}=0 \), respectively. If the PUCCH transmission or the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, \( K_{\mathrm{UE}, \text { offset }}=0 \). If the UE is provided a \( K_{\mathrm{UE}, \text { offset }} \) value by a MAC CE command, the UE applies the MAC command in the first slot that is after slot \( k+ 3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame }, \mu} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE command, \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH transmission that is determined in the slot when the MAC CE command is applied.
