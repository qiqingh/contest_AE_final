4.2 Transmission timing adjustments

A UE can be provided a value \( N_{\text {TA, offset }} \) of a timing advance offset for a serving cell by \( n \)-TimingAdvanceOffset for the serving cell. If the UE is not provided \( n \)-TimingAdvanceOffset for a serving cell, the UE determines a default value \( N_{\text {TA, offset }} \) of the timing advance offset for the serving cell as described in [10, TS 38.133].

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, a same timing advance offset value \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) offset applies to both carriers.

Upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG, the UE adjusts uplink timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all the serving cells in the TAG based on a value \( N_{\text {TA offset }} \) that the UE expects to be same for all the serving cells in the TAG and based on the received timing advance command where the uplink timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmissions is the same for all the serving cells in the TAG.

For a band with synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC in a band combination with non-applicable maximum transmit timing difference requirements as described in Note 1 of Table 7.5.3-1 of [10, TS 38.133], if the UE indicates ul-TimingAlignmentEUTRA-NR as 'required' and uplink transmission timing based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from MCG and a TAG from SCG are determined to be different by the UE, the UE adjusts the transmission timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all serving cells part of the band with the synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from a serving cell in MCG in the band. The UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH in one CG when the PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH is overlapping in time, even partially, with random access preamble transmitted in another CG.

For a SCS of \( 2^{\mu}+15 \mathrm{kHz} \), the timing advance command for a TAG indicates the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing for the TAG in multiples of \( 16 \cdot 64 \cdot T_{c} / 2^{\mu} \). The start timing of the random access preamble is described in [4, TS 38.211].

A timing advance command [11, TS 38.321 ] in case of random access response or in an absolute timing advance command MAC CE, \( T_{\mathrm{A}} \), for a TAG indicates \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) values by index values of \( T_{\mathrm{A}}=0,1,2, \ldots, 3846 \), where an amount of the time alignment for the TAG with SCS of \( 2^{\mu} \cdot 15 \mathrm{kHz} \) is \( N_{\mathrm{TA}}=T_{\mathrm{A}} \cdot 16 \cdot 64 / 2^{\mu} \). \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and is relative to the SCS of the first uplink transmission from the UE after the reception of the random access response or absolute timing advance command MAC CE.

In other cases, a timing advance command [11, TS 38.321], \( T_{\mathrm{A}} \), for a TAG indicates adjustment of a current \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) value, \( N_{\text {TA_old, to the new }} N_{\text {TA }} \) value, \( N_{\text {TA_new }} \), by index values of \( T_{\mathrm{A}}=0,1,2, \ldots, 63 \), where for a SCS of \( 2^{\mu} \cdot 15 \mathrm{kHz} \), \( N_{\text {TA_new }}=N_{\text {TA_old }}+\left(T_{\mathrm{A}}-31\right) \cdot 16 \cdot 64 / 2^{\mu} \).

If a UE has multiple active UL BWPs, as described in clause 12, in a same TAG, including UL BWPs in two UL carriers of a serving cell, the timing advance command value is relative to the largest SCS of the multiple active UL BWPs. The applicable \( N_{\text {TA_new }} \) value for an UL BWP with lower SCS may be rounded to align with the timing advance granularity for the UL BWP with the lower SCS while satisfying the timing advance accuracy requirements in [10, TS 38.133].

Adjustment of an \( N_{\text {TA }} \) value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing for the TAG by a corresponding amount, respectively.

For a timing advance command received on uplink slot \( n \) and for a transmission other than a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a fallbackRAR UL grant as described in clause 8.2A or 8.3, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to a successRAR as described in clause 8.2 A , the corresponding adjustment of the uplink transmission timing applies from the beginning of uplink slot \( n+k+1+2^{\mu} \cdot K_{\text {offset }} \) where \( k=\left\lceil N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame, } \mu}\right. \). \( \left.\left(N_{\mathrm{T}, 1}+N_{\mathrm{T}, 2}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \max }+0.5\right) / T_{\mathrm{sf}}\right], N_{\mathrm{T}, 1} \) is a time duration in msec of \( N_{1} \) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, \( N_{\mathrm{T}, 2} \) is a time duration in msec of \( \mathrm{N}_{2} \) symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214], \( N_{\text {TA, max }} \) is the maximum timing advance value in msec that can be provided by a TA command field of 12 bits, \( N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe, } \mu} \) is the number of slots per subframe, \( T_{\text {sf }} \) is the subframe duration of 1 msec , and \( K_{\text {offset }}=K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) \( K_{\text {UE } \text {, offset }} \), where \( K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) is provided by CellSpecific_Koffset and \( K_{\text {UE, offset }} \) is provided by a MAC CE command; otherwise, if not respectively provided, \( K_{\text {cell, offset }}=0 \) or \( K_{\text {UE, offset }}=0 . N_{1} \) and \( N_{2} \) are determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and of all configured DL BWPs for the corresponding downlink carriers. For \( \mu=0 \), the UE assumes \( N_{1,0}=14 \) [6, TS 38.214]. Slot \( n \) and \( N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu} \) are determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink
