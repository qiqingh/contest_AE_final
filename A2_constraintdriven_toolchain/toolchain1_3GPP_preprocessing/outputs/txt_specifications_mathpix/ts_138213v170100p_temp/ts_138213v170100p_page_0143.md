provided RB sets in the DL BWP, the UE expects that the RBs of the CORESET are within the union of the PRBs in the RB sets of the DL BWP.

For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 ,
- if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET, or has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI states for the CORESET by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure, or for a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19 for a same HARQ process;
- if a UE has been provided a configuration of more than one TCI states by tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList for the CORESET as part of Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] but has not received a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states as described in [11, TS 38.321], the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is quasi colocated with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331].

For a CORESET with index 0 ,
- if the UE is provided DLorJoint-TCIState and if followUnifiedTCIstate \( = \) 'enabled' for the CORESET, the UE assumes that a DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET and a DM-RS antenna port for PDSCH receptions scheduled by DCI formats provided by PDCCH receptions in the CORESET are quasi colocated with the reference signals provided by the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState[6, TS 38.214]
- else, the UE assumes that a DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with
- the one or more DL RS configured by a TCI state, where the TCI state is indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET, if any, or
- a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent random access procedure not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure, if no MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state for the CORESET is received after the most recent random access procedure, or a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent configured grant PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19.

For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0 , if a UE is provided a single TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one or two of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the one or more DL RS configured by the TCI states. For a CORESET with index 0 , the UE expects that a CSI-RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in a TCI state indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET is provided by a SS/PBCH block
- if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI states, the UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot \( k+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame }, \mu}+2^{\mu} \cdot k_{\text {mac }} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command, \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH in the slot when the activation command is applied, and \( k_{\text {mac }} \) is a number of slots for SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \) provided by \( K-M a c \) or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K-M a c \) is not provided.

If a UE is provided DLorJoint-TCIState, a DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH receptions in a CORESET, other than a CORESET with index 0 , associated only with USS sets and/or Type3-PDCCH CSS sets, and a DM-RS antenna port for PDSCH receptions scheduled by DCI formats provided by PDCCH receptions in the CORESET are quasi co-located with reference signals provided by the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState [6, TS 38.214].

If a UE is provided follow UnifiedTCIstate for a CORESET, other than a CORESET with index 0 , associated at least with CSS sets other than Type3-PDCCH CSS sets, and if followUnifiedTCIstate is set as enabled, a DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET and a DM-RS antenna port for PDSCH receptions scheduled by DCI formats provided by PDCCH receptions in the CORESET are quasi co-located with reference signals provided by the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState.

If the UE is provided by simultaneousTCI-UpdateListl or simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 up to two lists of cells for simultaneous TCI state activation, the UE applies the antenna port quasi co-location provided by one or two TCI-State
