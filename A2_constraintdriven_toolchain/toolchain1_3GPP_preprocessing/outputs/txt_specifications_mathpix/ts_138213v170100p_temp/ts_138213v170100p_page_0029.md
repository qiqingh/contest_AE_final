If the UE is not configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided by \( s s-P B C H \) BlockPower. If the UE is configured periodic CSI-RS reception, referenceSignalPower is provided either by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or by powerControlOffsetSS providing an offset of the CSI-RS transmission power relative to the SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. [f powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB .
- \( \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=10 \log _{10}\left(\left(2^{\mathrm{BPRE} \cdot K_{S}}-1\right) \cdot \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}\right) \) for \( K_{s}=1.25 \) and \( \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=0 \) for \( K_{s}=0 \) where \( K_{s} \) is provided by deltaMCS for each UL BWP \( b \) of each carrier \( f \) and serving cell \( c \). If the PUSCH transmission is over more than one layer \( [6, \mathrm{TS} 38.214], \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)=0 \). BPRE and \( \beta_{\mathrm{offset}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}} \), for active UL BWP \( b \) of each carrier \( f \) and each serving cell \( c \), are computed as below
- BPRE \( =\sum_{r=0}^{C-1} K_{r} / N_{R E} \) for PUSCH with UL-SCH data and BPRE \( =Q_{m} \cdot R / \beta_{\text {offset }}^{\text {PUSCH }} \) for CSI transmission in a PUSCH without UL-SCH data, where
- \( C \) is a number of transmitted code blocks, \( K_{r} \) is a size for code block \( r \), and \( N_{\mathrm{RE}} \) is a number of resource elements determined as \( N_{\mathrm{RE}}=N \cdot M_{\mathrm{RB}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(i) \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{N_{\mathrm{Symb}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(i)-1} N_{\mathrm{Sc}, \text { data }}^{\mathrm{RB}}(i, j) \), where \( N \geq 1 \) is provided by numberOfSlotsTBoMS as described in [6, TS 38.214] and \( N=1 \) if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is not provided, \( N_{\text {symb, } b, f, c}^{\text {PUSCH }}(i) \) is a number of symbols for PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c, N_{\mathrm{sc}, \text { data }}^{\mathrm{RB}}(i, j) \) is a number of subcarriers excluding DM-RS subcarriers and phasetracking RS samples [4, TS 38.211] in PUSCH symbol \( j \) and assuming no segmentation for a nominal repetition in case the PUSCH transmission is with repetition Type \( \mathrm{B}, 0 \leq j<N_{\mathrm{symb}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(i) \), and \( c, K_{r} \) are defined in [5, TS 38.212]
- \( \quad \beta_{\mathrm{offset}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}=1 \) when the PUSCH includes UL-SCH data and \( \beta_{\mathrm{offset}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}=\beta_{\mathrm{offset}}^{\mathrm{CSI}_{1}} \), as described in clause 9.3, when the PUSCH includes CSI and does not include UL-SCH data
- \( Q_{m} \) is the modulation order and \( R \) is the target code rate, as described in [6, TS 38.214], provided by the DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission that includes CSI and does not include UL-SCH data
- For the PUSCH power control adjustment state \( f_{b, f, c}(i, l) \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) in PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \)
- \( \quad \delta_{\mathrm{PUSCH}, b_{1} f_{1} c}(i, l) \) is a TPC command value included in a DCI format that schedules the PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) or jointly coded with other TPC commands in a DCI format 2_2 with CRC scrambled by TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, as described in clause 11.3
- \( l \in\{0,1\} \) if the UE is configured with twoPUSCH-PC-AdjustmentStates and \( l=0 \) if the UE is not configured with twoPUSCH-PC-AdjustmentStates or if the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a RAR UL grant as described in clause 8.3
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and is provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SRS resource set indicator field, and for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell

- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 10 or 11 , a first \( l \) and a second \( l \) are respectively equal to powerControlloopTo Use and powerControlLoopTo Use 2 in ConfiguredGrantConfig-
- else, for a PUSCH (re)transmission configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig, the value of \( l \in\{0,1\} \) is provided to the UE by powerControlLoopTo Use in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook', is provided SRI-PUSCHPowerControl, and a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of
