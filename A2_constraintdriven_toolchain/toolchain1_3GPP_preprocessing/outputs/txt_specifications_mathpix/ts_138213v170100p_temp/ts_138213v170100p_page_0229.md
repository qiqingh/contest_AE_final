If \( O_{\mathrm{ACK}} \leq 11 \), the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \( n_{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}} \) for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH , as described in clause 7.2.1, as
\[
\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}}=\left(V_{\mathrm{SAI}, \mathrm{~m}_{\text {last }}}^{\mathrm{SL}}-U_{\mathrm{SAJ}}\right) \bmod 4+\sum_{\mathrm{m}=0}^{\mathrm{M}-1} N_{\mathrm{m}}^{\text {received }}+N_{\mathrm{CG}}
\]
where
- \( \quad V_{\mathrm{SAl}, m_{\text {last }}}^{\mathrm{SL}} \) is a value of a counter SAI field in a last DCI format 30 scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated with PSFCH reception occasions that the UE detects within the \( M \) PDCCH monitoring occasions
- \( V_{\mathrm{SAl}, m_{\text {last }}}^{\mathrm{SL}}=0 \) if the UE does not detect any DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated with PSFCH reception occasions in any of the \( M \) PDCCH monitoring occasions
- \( U_{\text {SAI }} \) is a total number of DCI format \( 3 \_0 \), scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated with PSFCH reception occasions, that the UE detects within the \( M \) PDCCH monitoring occasions. \( U_{\text {SAI }}=0 \) if the UE does not detect any DCI format \( 3-0 \) scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions in any of the \( M \) PDCCH monitoring occasions
- \( \quad N_{m}^{\text {received }} \) is a number of DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions that the UE detects in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \)
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{CG}} \) is a number of SL configured grants for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH as for HARQ-ACK information corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions within the \( M \) PDCCH monitoring occasions

16.5.2.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format without an SAI field, then
- if the UE
- has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions on any serving cell, and
- does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a PSSCH transmission with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions associated with a SL configured grant to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause 16.5.2.1,
the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission;
- else, the UE generates and multiplexes in the PUSCH transmission the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1.
