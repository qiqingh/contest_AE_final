If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability or larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability or for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoring capability and with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per span or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells or to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells, respectively, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }, r 16 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr16
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr16, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 / r 17}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr16
- else, \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr16 from a combination of (pdcchBlindDetectionCAr16, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-Comblndicator-r17
and
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr 17
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr16, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 16}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17
- else, \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17 from a combination of (pdcchBlindDetectionCAr16, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-Comblndicator-r17

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability, or larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability, or larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability, or for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability, or for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than three downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability, at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl 6monitoringcapability and at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r17monitoringcapability. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of nonoverlapped CCEs per slot or per span or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells or to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 /\{r 15, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells or to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 /\{r 15, r 16\}}^{\text {capp }-r 17} \) downlink cells, respectively, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcchBlindDetectionCAr15
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr 16, pdcchBlindDetectionCAr17), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15
