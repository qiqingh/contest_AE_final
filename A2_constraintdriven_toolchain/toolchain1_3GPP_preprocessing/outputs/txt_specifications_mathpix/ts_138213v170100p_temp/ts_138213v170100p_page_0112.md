HARQ-ACK information and CSI report(s), the UE expects to be provided a same configuration for simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI each of PUCCH formats 2, 3, and 4.

If a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a PUCCH resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each of the CSI reports indicates rank 1 .

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, the UE is configured to multiplex different UCI types in one PUCCH, and at least one of the multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all corresponding UCI types if the following conditions are met. If one of the PUCCH transmissions or PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE expects that the first symbol \( S_{0} \) of the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH, among a group overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in the slot, satisfies the following timeline conditions
- \( S_{0} \) is not before a symbol with CP starting after \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{\text {mux }} \) after a last symbol of any corresponding PDSCH, \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{\text {mux }} \) is given by maximum of \( \left\{T_{p r o c, 1}^{m u x, 1}, \cdots, T_{p r o c, 1}^{m u x, i}, \cdots\right\} \) where for the \( i \)-th PDSCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( T_{p r o c, 1}^{m u x, i}= \left(N_{1}+d_{1,1}+1\right) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C}, d_{1,1} \) is selected for the \( i \)-th PDSCH following [6, TS 38.214], \( N_{1} \) is selected based on the UE PDSCH processing capability of the \( i \)-th PDSCH and SCS configuration \( \mu \), where \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH scheduling the \( i \)-th PDSCH, the \( i \)-th PDSCH, the PUCCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission for the \( i \)-th PDSCH, and all PUSCHs in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.
- \( S_{0} \) is not before a symbol with CP starting after \( T_{\text {proc, release }}^{\text {mux }} \) after a last symbol of a PDCCH reception providing a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception. \( T_{p r o c, r e l e a s e}^{m u x} \) is given by maximum of \( \left\{T_{\text {proc,release }}^{\text {mux } 1}, \cdots, T_{\text {proc,release }}^{\text {mux, } 1} \cdots\right\} \) where for the \( i \)-th PDCCH providing the DCI format with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( T_{\text {proc,release }}^{\text {mux, }}=(N+1) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C}, N \) as described in clause 10.2, where \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH, the PUCCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK information, and all PUSCHs in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.
- if there is no aperiodic CSI report multiplexed in a PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( S_{0} \) is not before a symbol with CP starting after \( T_{p r o c, 2}^{\operatorname{mux}} \) after a last symbol of
- any PDCCH with the DCI format scheduling an overlapping PUSCH, and
- any PDCCH providing a DCI format with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in an overlapping PUCCH in the slot

If there is at least one PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\text {mux }} \) is given by maximum of \( \left\{T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\text {mux }, 1}, \cdots, T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\text {mux },} \cdots\right\} \) where for the i -th PUSCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( T_{p r o c, 2}^{m u x, i}=\max \left(\left(N_{2}+d_{2,1}+1\right) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C}+T_{\text {switch }}, d_{2,2}\right), d_{2,1}, d_{2,2} \) and \( T_{\text {switch }} \) are selected for the \( i \)-th PUSCH following [6, TS 38.214], \( N_{2} \) is selected based on the UE PUSCH processing capability of the \( i \)-th PUSCH and SCS configuration \( \mu \), where \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH scheduling the \( i \)-th PUSCH, the PDCCHs scheduling the PDSCHs, or providing the DCI formats without scheduling PDSCHs, with corresponding HARQ-ACK information on a PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs/PUSCHs, and all PUSCHs in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.

If there is no PUSCH in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\text {mux }} \) is given by maximum of \( \left\{T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{m u x, 1}, \cdots, T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{m u x, i}, \cdots\right\} \) where for the \( i \)-th PDSCH, or the \( i \)-th PDCCH providing a DCI format without scheduling PDSCH, with corresponding HARQ-ACK information on a PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs, \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{\text {mux }, i}=\left(N_{2}+1\right) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C}, N_{2} \) is selected based on the UE PUSCH processing capability of the PUCCH serving cell if configured. \( N_{2} \) is selected based on the UE PUSCH processing capability 1, if PUSCH processing capability is not configured for the PUCCH serving cell. \( \mu \) is selected based on the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration used for the PDCCH
