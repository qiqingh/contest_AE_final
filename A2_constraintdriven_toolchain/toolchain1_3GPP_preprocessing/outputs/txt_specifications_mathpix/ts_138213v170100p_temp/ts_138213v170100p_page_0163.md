- a current active DL BWP, for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP is not the dormant DL BWP
- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 1_1, and if
- the CRC of DCI format 1_1 is scrambled by a C-RNTI or a MCS-C-RNTI, and if
- a one-shot HARQ-ACK request field is not present or has a ' 0 ' value, and if
- the UE detects a DCI format 1 _ 1 on the primary cell that does not include a carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format 1_1 on the primary cell that includes a carrier indicator field with value equal to 0 , and if
- resourceAllocation \( = \) resourceAllocationType0 and all bits of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 0 , or
- resourceAllocation \( = \) resourceAllocationTypel and all bits of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 1 , or
- resourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch and all bits of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 0 or 1
the UE considers the DCI format 1_1 as indicating SCell dormancy, not scheduling a PDSCH reception, and for transport block 1 interprets the sequence of fields of
- modulation and coding scheme
- new data indicator
- redundancy version
and of
- HARQ process number
- antenna port(s)
- DMRS sequence initialization
as providing a bitmap to each configured SCell, in an ascending order of the SCell index, where
- a ' 0 ' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided by dormantBWP-Id, for the UE for a corresponding activated SCell
- a '1' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
- an active DL BWP, provided by firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id, for the UE for a corresponding activated SCell, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP
- a current active DL BWP, for the UE for a corresponding activated SCell, if the current active DL BWP is not the dormant DL BWP
- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP

If an active DL BWP provided by dormantBWP-Id for a UE on an activated SCell is not a default DL BWP for the UE on the activated SCell, as described in clause 12, the BWP inactivity timer is not used for transitioning from the active DL BWP provided by dormantBWP-Id to the default DL BWP on the activated SCell.

A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a detection of a DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) indicating SCell dormancy after \( N \) symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the DCI format 1_1. If processingType2Enabled of PDSCH-ServingCellConfig is set to enable for the serving cell with the PDCCH providing the DCI format 1_1, \( N=7 \) for \( \mu=0, N=7.5 \) for \( \mu=1 \), and \( N=15 \) for \( \mu=2 \); otherwise, \( N=14 \) for \( \mu=0, N= \) 16 for \( \mu=1, N=27 \) for \( \mu=2, N=31 \) for \( \mu=3, N=124 \) for \( \mu=5 \), and \( =248 \) for \( \mu=6 \), where \( \mu \) is the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH providing the DCI format 1 _ 1 and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information in response to the detection of the DCI format 1 _
