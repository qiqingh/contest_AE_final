- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE of a candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI, the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE
- has received ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for a serving cell, and
- does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE of a candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon,
the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE
- has received ssb-PositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI for a serving cell, and
- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE of a candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI with same physical cell identity as the one associated with a RS having same quasi-collocation properties as a CORESET for the PDCCH candidate,
the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
A UE is not required to monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0/0A/1/2-PDCCH CSS set when the active TCI state for a corresponding CORESET is not associated with physCellld in ServingCellConfigCommon.

If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.

If at least one RE of a PDCCH candidate for a UE on the serving cell overlaps with at least one RE of lte-CRSToMatchAround, or of LTE-CRS-PatternList, the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

If a UE is provided availableRB-SetsPerCell, the UE is not required to monitor PDCCH candidates that overlap with any RB from RB sets that are indicated as unavailable for receptions by an available RB set indicator field in DCI format 2_0 as described in clause 11.1.1. If the UE does not obtain the available RB set indicator for a symbol, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates on all RB sets in the symbol.

If a UE can support
- a first set of \( N_{\text {cell }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) serving cells where the UE is either not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with a single value for all CORESETs on all DL BWPs of each scheduling cell from the first set of serving cells, and
- a second set of \( N_{\text {cell }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) serving cells where the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with a value 0 for a first CORESET, and with a value 1 for a second CORESET on any DL BWP of each scheduling cell from the second set of serving cells
the UE determines, for the purpose of reporting pdcch-BlindDetectionCA, a number of serving cells as \( N_{\text {cell }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}}+R \). \( N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) where \( R \) is a value reported by the UE.

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than 4 serving cells and the UE is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig for any downlink cell or if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability for all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and for a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor per slot when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) downlink cells, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) is \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}}+R \cdot N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCA where \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}}+N_{\text {cells }, 1}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) is the number of configured downlink serving cells
