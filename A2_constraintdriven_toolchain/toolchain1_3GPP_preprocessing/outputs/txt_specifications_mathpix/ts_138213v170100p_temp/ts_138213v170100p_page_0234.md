For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, when a number of HARQ-ACK information bits is one, a UE transmits a PUCCH only when the HARQ-ACK information bit has NACK value. For a PUCCH resource associated with PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining \( m_{0} \) as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting \( m_{\mathrm{cs}}=0 \). For a PUCCH resource associated with PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting \( b(0)=0 \).

For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, when a number of HARQ-ACK information bits is 2,3 , or 4 , the UE can be indicated by moreThanOneNackOnly-Mode to provide the HARQ-ACK information bits in a PUCCH either according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode or by selecting a resource from a set of resources for the PUCCH transmission based on the values of the HARQ-ACK information bits as described in Table 18-1.

If a UE is provided pucch-Config-Multicastl or pucch-Config-Multicast2 for PUCCH transmissions with a priority value, the UE transmits a PUCCH with the priority value according to pucch-Config-Multicastl or pucch-ConfigMulticast2 for each G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI that the UE provides associated HARQ-ACK information according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode or the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode.

A PDSCH reception providing an initial transmission of a transport block is scheduled only by a multicast DCI format. For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, a PDSCH reception providing a retransmission of the transport block can be scheduled either by a multicast DCI format using a same G-RNTI as the G-RNTI of the initial transmission of the transport block, or by a unicast DCI format using a C-RNTI [6, TS 38.214].

An activation for SPS PDSCH receptions using a G-CS-RNTI for a corresponding SPS PDSCH configuration is provided only by a multicast DCI format as described in clause 10.2 by replacing CS-RNTI with the G-CS-RNTI. A release for SPS PDSCH receptions using a G-CS-RNTI for a corresponding SPS PDSCH configuration is provided by a multicast DCI format as described in clause 10.2 by replacing CS-RNTI with the G-CS-RNTI, or by a DCI format with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI. For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode and for a transport block that a UE received in a SPS PDSCH, a PDSCH reception providing a retransmission of the transport block can be scheduled either by a unicast DCI format using a CS-RNTI or by a multicast DCI format using a same G-CS-RNTI as the G-CS-RNTI of the initial transmission of the transport block [6, TS 38.214].

A UE can be configured per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI, by harq-FeedbackEnabler-Multicast with value set to 'enabled', to provide HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH receptions. When the UE is not provided harq-FeedbackEnabler-Multicast for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or when the UE is provided harq-FeedbackEnablerMulticast with value set to 'disabled', the UE does not provide HARQ-ACK information for respective PDSCH receptions. If a UE is provided harq-FeedbackEnabler-Multicast with value set to 'dci-enabler' for a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI, the UE determines whether or not to provide the HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH receptions based on an indication by the multicast DCI format associated with the G-RNTI or the G-CS-RNTI [4, TS 38.212].

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information that the UE would provide according to the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode with other UCI in a first PUCCH, or in a PUSCH, as described in clauses 9 and \( 9.2-5 \), the UE provides the HARQ-ACK information according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode. For resolving an overlapping among a second PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information according to the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode and other PUCCHs or PUSCHs prior to multiplexing the HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH, the UE considers that the UE would transmit the second PUCCH when all values of the HARQ-ACK information are 'ACK'.

If a UE is provided multiple G-RNTIs or G-CS-RNTIs, a configuration for a HARQ-ACK codebook type applies to all G-RNTIs or G-CS-RNTIs.

If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-Multicast \( = \) semi-static, the UE generates a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.2.1, and 9.1.2.2.

If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-Multicast \( = \) dynamic, the UE generates a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.3.1.

If, for unicast and multicast HARQ-ACK information of same priority value, a UE
- is provided
- either pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16 and pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-Multicast \( = \) semi-static,
- or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static and pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-Multicast = dynamic, and
- would multiplex the unicast and multicast HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH or PUSCH
