A UE expects that \( P+P_{2} \) divides 20 msec.
The first symbol every \( 20 /\left(P+P_{2}\right) \) periods is a first symbol in an even frame.

A UE expects that the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{re} \Gamma} \) is smaller than or equal to a SCS configuration \( \mu \) for any configured DL BWP or UL BWP. Each slot provided by pattern \( l \) or pattern 2 is applicable to \( 2^{\left(\mu-\mu_{\mathrm{er}}\right)} \) consecutive slots in the active DL BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{re} \Gamma} \) and each downlink or flexible or uplink symbol for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{re} \Gamma} \) corresponds to \( 2^{\left(\mu-\mu_{\mathrm{rer}}\right)} \) consecutive downlink or flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration \( \mu \).

If the UE is additionally provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the parameter tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated overrides only flexible symbols per slot over the number of slots as provided by \( t d d-U L-D L- \) ConfigurationCommon.

The tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated provides
- a set of slot configurations by slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList
- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations
- a slot index for a slot provided by slotIndex
- a set of symbols for a slot by symbols where
- if symbols = allDownink, all symbols in the slot are downlink
- if symbols = allUplink, all symbols in the slot are uplink
- if symbols = explicit, nrofDownlinkSymbols provides a number of downlink first symbols in the slot and nrofUplinkSymbols provides a number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If nrofDownlinkSymbols is not provided, there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if noofUplinkSymbols is not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible

For each slot having a corresponding index provided by slotIndex, the UE applies a format provided by a corresponding symbols. The UE does not expect tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to indicate as uplink or as downlink a symbol that tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon indicates as a downlink or as an uplink symbol, respectively.

For each slot configuration provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, a reference SCS configuration is the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {re } 5} \) provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon.

A slot configuration period and a number of downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols in each slot of the slot configuration period are determined from \( t d d-U L-D L \)-ConfigurationCommon and \( t d d-U L-D L- \) ConfigurationDedicated and are common to each configured BWP.

A UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated to be available for receptions and considers symbols in a slot indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-Configuration Common, or by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to be available for transmissions.

If a UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format \( 2-0 \), for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or when tdd-UL-DL-Configuration Common and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated are not provided to the UE
- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format
- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS, or a DL PRS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE receives the PDCCH, the PDSCH, the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS if the UE does not detect a DCI format that indicates to the UE to transmit a PUSCH, a PUCCH, a PRACH, or a SRS in at least one symbol of the set of symbols of the slot; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PDCCH, or the PDSCH, or the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot.
