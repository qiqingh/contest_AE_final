- with respect to all serving cells, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell is not changed due to a use of the symbol by the [AB-DU, or
- the \( [A B-M T \) detects a \( D C I \) format \( 2-5 \) with an \( A I \) index field value indicating the soft symbol as available if the [AB-MT is not configured with an SCG, or
- the IAB-MT detects two DCI formats 2_5 with an AI index field indicating the soft symbol as available from the MCG and SCG, respectively, or
- the [AB-MT detects a DCI format 25 with an AI index field value indicating the soft symbol as available from one cell group and with respect to all serving cells of the other cell group, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell does not change due to a use of the symbol by the [AB-DU.

When the \( [A B-M T \) receives a DCI format \( 2-5 \) from a serving cell in a cell group, the \( [A B-M T \) applies the information of the DCI format 2_5 to all serving cells of the cell group.

When a symbol is configured as unavailable, the [AB-DU neither transmits nor receives in the symbol.
A symbol of a slot is equivalent to being configured as hard if an [AB-DU would transmit a SS/PBCH block, PDCCH for Type0-PDCCH CSS sets configured by pdcchConfigSIB1, or a periodic CSI-RS in the symbol of the slot, or would receive a PRACH or a SR in the symbol of the slot.

With reference to slots of an [AB-DU cell, the [AB-DU can be provided an indication of hard, soft or unavailable type per RB set for symbols configured as downlink, uplink or flexible in a slot by Rel-17 frequency-domain IAB-DU-Resource-Configuration-H/S/NA-Config [16, TS 38.473]. The RB set size and the number of RB sets are configured by RB-Set-Configuration [16, TS 38-473]. If an indication of hard, soft or unavailable type is not provided for an RB set of a symbol in a slot, the [AB-DU applies the configuration of hard, soft or unavailable type provided by HSNA Slot Configuration List in gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration [16, TS 38-473] for the RB set of the symbol in the slot. If an indication of hard, soft, or unavailable type is provided for an RB set in a symbol of a slot, the [AB-DU applies the configuration of hard, soft, or unavailable type provided by Rel-17 frequency-domain IAB-DU-Resource-Configuration-H/S/NA-Config [16, TS 38-473] when the [AB-node uses simultaneous transmission and reception in the slot.

When an RB set of a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as hard, the [AB-DU cell can respectively transmit, receive, or either transmit or receive on the RB set in the symbol.

When an RB set of a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as soft, the [AB-DU cell can respectively transmit, receive or either transmit or receive on the RB set in the symbol only if
- the [AB-MT does not transmit or receive on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, or
- with respect to all serving cells, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception on the RB set or any RB set that is configured as unavailable or configured as soft and not indicated as available during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell is not changed due to a use of the RB set in the symbol by the [AB-DU, or
- the [AB-MT detects a DCI format 2 with an AI index field value indicating the soft RB set as available if the [AB-MT is not configured with an SCG, or
- the [AB-MT detects two DCI formats 2_5 with an AI index field value indicating the soft RB set as available from the MCG and SCG, respectively, or
- the [AB-MT detects a DCI format 2_5 with an AI index field value indicating the soft \( R B \) set as available from one cell group and with respect to all serving cells of the other cell group, the [AB-MT would transmit or receive on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell, and the transmission or reception on the RB set during the symbol of the [AB-DU cell does not change due to a use of the RB set in the symbol by the [AB-DU.

When an RB set of a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as unavailable, the [AB-DU neither transmits nor receives in the RB set in the symbol.

If an [AB-node is provided an Availabilitylndicator, the [AB-node is provided an AI-RNTI by ai-RNTI and a payload size of a DCI format 2_5 by dci-PayloadSizeAI. The [AB-node is also provided a search space set configuration, by SearchSpace, for monitoring PDCCH.
