- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band,
- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in multiple CORESETs that have been configured with same or different qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties on active DL BWP(s) of one or more cells,
- one or more CORESETs have two activated TCI states, and
- reports twoTypeDcapabilityname
the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a CORESET with a first qcl-Type set to first 'typeD' properties and, if any, a second qcl-Type set to second 'typeD' properties that are different than the first 'typeD' properties, and in any other CORESET from the multiple CORESETs with corresponding qcl-Type set to the first 'typeD' properties or to the second 'typeD' properties
- the CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell with the lowest index containing CSS, if any; otherwise, to the USS set with the lowest index in the cell with lowest index
- the lowest USS set index is determined over all USS sets with at least one PDCCH candidate in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions

For the purpose of determining the CORESET, a SS/PBCH block is considered to have different QCL 'typeD' properties than a CSI-RS.

For the purpose of determining the CORESET, a first CSI-RS associated with a SS/PBCH block in a first cell and a second CSI-RS in a second cell that is also associated with the SS/PBCH block are assumed to have same QCL 'typeD' properties.

The allocation of non-overlapping CCEs and of PDCCH candidates for PDCCH monitoring is according to all search space sets associated with the multiple CORESETs on the active DL BWP(s) of the one or more cells.

The number of active TCI states is determined from the multiple CORESETs.
If a UE
- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, and
- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in multiple CORESETs where none of the CORESETs has TCI-states configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD',
the UE is required to monitor PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions for search space sets associated with different CORESETs.

For a scheduled cell and at any time, if a UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE expects to have received at most 16 PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, G-RNTI for multicast, or G-CSRNTI scheduling 16 PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any corresponding PDSCH symbol and at most 16 PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling 16 PUSCH transmissions for which the UE has not transmitted any corresponding PUSCH symbol.

If a UE is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r16monitoringcapability for any serving cell, and
- is not configured for NR-DC operation and indicates through pdcch-BlindDetectionCA a capability to monitor PDCCH candidates for \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \geq 4 \) downlink cells and the UE is configured with \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}}>4 \) downlink cells or \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{UL}}>4 \) uplink cells, or
- is configured with NR-DC operation and for a cell group with \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {DL }} \) downlink cells or \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {UL }} \) uplink cells the UE expects to have respectively received at most \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) PDCCHs for
- DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a MCS-C-RNTI scheduling \( 16 \cdot N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }} \) PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any corresponding PDSCH symbol over all \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) downlink cells
