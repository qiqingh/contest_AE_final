If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions and provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission with PUSCH repetition Type B having a nominal repetition that spans multiple slots on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) and overlaps with one or more slots on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \), the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the first slot of the one or more slots on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) that overlaps with the multiple slots of the nominal repetition on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \).

For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered, the UE provides power headroom of the first PUSCH, if any, on the determined NR slot as described in clause 7.7.

If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, the UE does not consider for computation of a Type 1 power headroom report in a first PUSCH transmission that includes an initial transmission of transport block on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) of carrier \( f_{1} \) of serving cell \( c_{1} \), a second PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) of carrier \( f_{2} \) of serving cell \( c_{2} \) that overlaps with the first PUSCH transmission if
- the second PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format in a PDCCH received in a second PDCCH monitoring occasion, and
- the second PDCCH monitoring occasion is after a first PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the earliest DCI format scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block after a power headroom report was triggered
or
- the second PUSCH transmission is after the first uplink symbol of the first PUSCH transmission minus \( T_{\text {proc. } 2}^{\prime}=T_{\text {proc. } 2} \) where \( T_{\text {proc. } 2} \) is determined according to \( \left[6\right. \), TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=1, d_{2,2}=0 \), and with \( \mu_{D L} \) corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the first PUSCH transmission is on a configured grant after a power headroom report was triggered.

If the UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated serving cell is based on a reference PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), the UE computes the Type 1 power headroom report as
\[
P H_{\text {type } 1 b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right)=\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f, c}(i)-\left\{P_{\mathrm{O} \geq \mathrm{PUSCH} b, f, c}(j)+\alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \cdot P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+f_{b, f, c}(i, l)\right\}
\]
where \( \tilde{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f_{,} c}(i) \) is computed assuming \( \mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB}, \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB}, \mathrm{P}-\mathrm{MPR}=0 \mathrm{~dB} . \triangle \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}=0 \mathrm{~dB} \). MPR, A-MPR, PMPR and \( \Delta \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}} \) are defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3]. The remaining parameters are defined in clause 7.1.1 where \( P_{0 \_ \text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) and \( \alpha_{b_{1}, c, c}(j) \) are obtained using \( P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL }, \text { PUSCH }, f, c}(0) \) and \( p 0 \) -PUSCH-AlphaSetld \( =0, P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) is obtained using pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id \( =0 \), and \( l=0 \).

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided pusch-Config for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by pucch-Config. If pucch-Config is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.

If a UE transmits a PUSCH associated with a RS resource index \( q_{d} \), as described in clause 7.1.1, on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) in slot \( n \) and provides a Type 1 power headroom report for an actual PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index \( q_{d} \), the Type 1 power headroom report is for the first PUSCH repetition associated with the RS resource index \( q_{d} \) that overlaps with slot \( n \).

If a UE transmits a PUSCH associated with a first RS resource index \( q_{d} \), as described in clause 7.1.1, on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) in slot \( n \) and is provided twoPHRMode, the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for PUSCH repetition associated with a second RS resource index \( q_{d} \), as described in clause 7.1.1, where
- if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for an actual PUSCH repetition associated with the first RS resource index \( q_{d} \),
- if the UE transmits PUSCH repetitions associated with the second RS resource index \( q_{d} \) in slot \( n \), the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for a first actual PUSCH repetition associated with the second RS resource index \( q_{d} \) that overlaps with slot \( n \)
