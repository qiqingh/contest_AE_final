ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

A UE configured with a bandwidth part indicator in a DCI format determines, in case of an active DL BWP or of an active UL BWP change, that the information in the DCI format is applicable to the new active DL BWP or UL BWP, respectively, as described in clause 12 .

For unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on serving cell \( c_{2} \), the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH on serving cell \( c_{1} \) if the PDCCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [ 10 , TS 38.133]) on serving cell \( c_{2} \) and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on serving cell \( c_{1} \) and serving cell \( c_{2} \).

If a UE is provided resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config, or if the UE is additionally provided periodicityAndPattern in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config, the UE can determine a set of RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception scheduled by a unicast DCI format as described in [6, TS 38.214]. If a PDCCH candidate that provides a unicast DCI format is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

If a UE is provided resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config-Multicast, or if the UE is additionally provided periodicityAndPattern in RateMatchPattern of PDSCH-Config-Multicast, the UE can determine a set of RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception scheduled by a multicast DCI format. If a PDCCH candidate that provides a multicast DCI format is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

A UE does not expect to be configured with dci-FormatsSL and dci-FormatsExt in a same USS.
10.1.1 Self-carrier and cross-carrier scheduling on the primary cell

A UE can be configured for scheduling on the primary cell from the primary cell and from a secondary cell [ 12 , TS 38.331]. The UE is either not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig or the UE is provided only monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability for the primary cell and for the secondary cell. The UE is not provided coresetPoollndex on the primary cell or on the secondary cell.

The SCS configuration \( \mu_{P} \) for the active DL BWP on the primary cell is smaller than or equal to the SCS configuration \( \mu_{S} \) for the active DL BWP on the secondary cell.

For the remaining of this clause, either the secondary cell is activated and the active DL BWP is not a dormant DL BWP for a UE, or the UE does not indicate a capability [16, TS 36.306] for disabling \( \alpha \) that is provided by ccsBlindDetectionSplit; otherwise, procedures described in the remaining of this clause are not applicable for the UE and the procedures are as described in clause 10.1.

If \( \mu_{P}<\mu_{S} \), the UE determines \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{P}} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{P}} \), and determines \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{S}} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{S}} \), by including the primary cell only in the \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu_{P}} \) downlink cells in \( \sum_{j=0}^{3}\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{I}}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}\right) \), as described in clause 10.1. If \( \mu_{P}=\mu_{S}= \mu \), the UE determines \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu} \) by including the primary cell once in the \( N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells in \( \sum_{j=0}^{3}\left(N_{\text {cells }, 0}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}+\gamma \cdot N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{I}}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}\right) \), as described in clause 10.1.

For scheduling on the primary cell from the primary cell, the UE is not required to monitor more than \( \left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , \text { slot }, \mu_{P}}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, \text { slot }, \mu_{P}}\right)\right\rfloor \) PDCCH candidates per slot or more than \( \left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu_{P}}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu_{P}}\right)\right\rfloor \) nonoverlapping CCEs per slot on the active DL BWP of the primary cell, where \( \alpha \) is provided by ccs-BlindDetectionSplit.

For scheduling on the primary cell from the secondary cell, the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL BWP of the secondary cell more than
- \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s l o t, \mu S} \) PDCCH candidates per slot or more than \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s l o t, \mu_{S}} \) non-overlapping CCEs per slot of the active DL BWP of the secondary cell
- \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max }, \text { slot }, \mu_{P}}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{P}}\right)-\left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } \text { slot, } \mu_{P}}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu_{P}}\right)\right\rfloor \) PDCCH candidates per slot or more than \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu_{P}}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }}, \mu_{P}\right)-\left\lfloor\alpha \cdot \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu_{P}}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu_{P}}\right)\right\rfloor \) non-overlapping CCEs per slot of the active DL BWP of the primary cell

If \( \mu_{P}<\mu_{S} \), the UE does not count PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs that the UE monitors for scheduling on the primary cell from the secondary cell towards \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, } \text { slot }, \mu_{S}} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu_{S}} \), respectively.
