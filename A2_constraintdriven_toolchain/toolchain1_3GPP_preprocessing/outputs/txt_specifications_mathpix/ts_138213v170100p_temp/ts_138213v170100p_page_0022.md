- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpower, \( s=1 \)
- else, if each SRS resource in the SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, the UE scales the linear value by the ratio of the number of antenna ports with a non-zero PUSCH transmission power to the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource.

The UE splits the power equally across the antenna ports on which the UE transmits the PUSCH with non-zero power.
7.1.1 UE behaviour

If a UE transmits a PUSCH on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) using parameter set configuration with index \( j \) and PUSCH power control adjustment state with index \( l \), the UE determines the PUSCH transmission power \( P_{\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \) in PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) as
\[
\begin{array}{c}
P_{\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right)=\min \left\{\begin{array}{l}
P_{\mathrm{CMAX}_{1}, f, c}(i), \\
P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{PUSCH}_{1}, f, c}(j)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{RE}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PuSCH}}(i)\right)+\alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \cdot P L_{b_{1}, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+\Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)+f_{b, f, c}(i, l)
\end{array}\right\} \\
\quad[\mathrm{dBm}]
\end{array}
\]
where,
- \( P_{\text {CMAX }} f_{, c}(i) \) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS38.101-3] for carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) in PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \).
- \( \quad P_{0 \_ \text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) is a parameter composed of the sum of a component \( P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL }, \mathrm{PUSCH}, f, c}(j) \) and a component \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) where \( j \in\{0,1, \ldots, J-1\} \).
- If a UE established dedicated RRC connection using a Type-1 random access procedure, as described in clause 8, and is not provided P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet or for a PUSCH (re)transmission corresponding to a RAR UL grant as described in clause 8.3,
\[
j=0, P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUSCH }, b, f, c}(0)=0, \text { and } P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL,PUSCH }, f, c}(0)=P_{0 \_ \text {PRE }}+\Delta_{\text {PREAMBLE, Msg3 }},
\]
where \( P_{0 \_ \text {PRE }} \) is provided by preambleReceivedTargetPower [11, TS 38.321] and \( \triangle_{\text {PREAMBLE_Msg }} \) is provided by \( m s g 3 \)-DeltaPreamble, or \( \Delta_{\text {PREAMBLE,Msg3 }}=0 \mathrm{~dB} \) if \( m s g 3 \)-DeltaPreamble is not provided, for carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- If a UE established dedicated RRC connection using a Type-2 random access procedure, as described in clause 8, and is not provided P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet, or for a PUSCH transmission for Type-2 random access procedure as described in clause 8.1A,
\[
j=0, P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{UE} \_\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f_{1}, c}(0)=0, \text { and } P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{NOMINAL} \mathrm{PUSCH}, f_{1} c}(0)=P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \mathrm{PRE}}+\Delta_{\mathrm{MsgA}_{-} P U S C H},
\]
where \( P_{0 \_ \text {PRE }} \) is provided by msgA-preambleReceivedTargetPower, or by preambleReceivedTargetPower if msgA-preambleReceivedTargetPower is not provided and \( \Delta_{\text {Msga_PUSCH }} \) is provided by msgA-DeltaPreamble, or \( \Delta_{\text {Msga_PUSCH }}=\Delta_{\text {PREAMBLE_Msg3 }} \mathrm{dB} \) if msgA-DeltaPreamble is not provided, for carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- For a PUSCH (re)transmission configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig, \( j=1, P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL,PUSCH, } f, c}(1) \) is provided by \( p 0 \)-NominalWithoutGrant, or \( P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL }} \) PUSCH \( _{1} f_{1} c ~(1)=P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL PUSCH } f_{1} c}(0) \) if \( p 0 \) NominalWithoutGrant is not provided.
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and is provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SRS resource set indicator field, and for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell
- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 00 , first \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE } \_ \text {PUSCH }, b_{1}, c, c}(1) \) value is provided by the value of p0-PUSCH-Alpha in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 01 , second \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE PUSCH }, b, f, c}(1) \) value is provided by the value of p0-PUSCH-Alpha 2 in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
