For each UL BWP in a set of UL BWPs of the PCell or of the PUCCH-SCell, the UE is configured resource sets for PUCCH transmissions as described in clause 9.2.1.

A UE receives PDCCH and PDSCH in a DL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP length for the DL BWP. A UE transmits PUCCH and PUSCH in an UL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP length for the UL BWP.

If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active DL BWP, from the configured DL BWP set, for DL receptions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active UL BWP, from the configured UL BWP set, for UL transmissions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a band width part indicator field is configured in a DCI format and indicates an UL BWP or a DL BWP different from the active UL BWP or DL BWP, respectively, the UE shall
- for each information field in the DCI format
- if the size of the information field is smaller than the one required for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE prepends zeros to the information field until its size is the one required for the interpretation of the information field for the UL BWP or DL BWP prior to interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively
- if the size of the information field is larger than the one required for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE uses a number of least significant bits of the DCI format equal to the one required for the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by bandwidth part indicator prior to interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively
- set the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by the bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format

If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and indicates an active UL BWP with different SCS configuration \( \mu \), or with different number \( N_{\text {RB-set, UL }}^{\text {BWP }} \) of RB sets, than a current active UL BWP, the UE determines an uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 based on \( X^{\prime} \) bits and \( Y^{\prime} \) bits that are generated by independently truncating or padding the \( X \) MSBs and the \( Y \) LSBs [6, TS 38.214] of the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), where truncation starts from the MSBs of the X bits or the Y bits, zero-padding prepends zeros to the X bits or the Y bits, and
- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration \( \mu=1 \) and the current active BWP has SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \), the \( X \) MSBs are truncated to \( X^{\prime}=X-1 \) bits, or
- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \) and the current active BWP has SCS configuration \( \mu=1 \), the \( X \) MSBs are zero-padded to \( X^{\prime}=X+1 \) bits
- otherwise, the \( X \) MSBs are unchanged
and
- the \( Y \) LSBs are truncated or zero-padded to \( Y^{\prime}=\left\lceil\log _{2}\left(\frac{N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set, UL }}^{\mathrm{BWP}}\left(N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set, UL }}^{\mathrm{BWP}}+1\right)}{2}\right)\right\rceil \) bits where \( N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set, UL }}^{\mathrm{BWP}} \) is a number of RB sets configured for the indicated active UL BWP

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP change with the corresponding time domain resource assignment field providing a slot offset value for a PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission that is smaller than a delay required by the UE for an active DL BWP change or UL BWP change, respectively [10, TS 38.133].

If a UE detects a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active DL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in a scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.

If a UE detects a DCI format with SCell dormancy indication that indicates an active DL BWP change for an Scell in slot \( n \) of primary cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the SCell during a time duration specified in [10, TS 38.133].
