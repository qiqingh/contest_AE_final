If the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1,
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UEl or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UEl is \( [0,1, \ldots, p d c c h \) BlindDetectionCAl], and
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UEl + pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UEl>=pdcch-BlindDetectionCAl.

Otherwise, if \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC} \text { max, } \mathrm{r} 15}^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { is a maximum total number of downlink cells for which the UE is provided }} \) monitoringCapabilityConfig = r15monitoringcapability and the UE is configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in UE-NR-Capability
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UEl or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UEl is \( [0,1,2] \),

If the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE2 or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE2 is \( [0,1, \ldots, p d c c h \) BlindDetectionCA2], and
- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE2 + pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE2>= pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2.

Otherwise, if \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC} \text { max, } \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL}, \text { is a maximum total number of downlink cells for which the } \mathrm{UE} \text { is provided }} \) monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability and the UE is configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in UE-NR-Capability
- the value range of pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE2 or of pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE2 is \( [0,1] \),

10.1 UE procedure for determining physical downlink control channel assignment

A set of PDCCH candidates for a UE to monitor is defined in terms of PDCCH search space sets. A search space set can be a CSS set or a USS set. A UE monitors PDCCH candidates in one or more of the following search spaces sets
- a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell of the MCG configured by
- pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or by searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon or by searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI, or
- searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigCommon when pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH are not provided, for a DCI format \( 4 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI
- a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format 1 _ 0 with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG
- a Type0B-PDCCH CSS set configured by searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config\( M T C H \) for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI, on the primary cell of the MCG
- a Type1-PDCCH CSS set configured by ra-SearchSpace in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format 10 with CRC scrambled by a RA-RNTI, a MsgB-RNTI, or a TC-RNTI on the primary cell
- a Type1A-PDCCH CSS set configured by sdt-SearchSpace in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI or a CS-RNTI on the primary cell as described in clause 19.1
- a Type2-PDCCH CSS set configured by pagingSearchSpace in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a P-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG
- a Type2A-PDCCH CSS set configured by peiSearchSpace in DownlinkConfigCommonSIB for a DCI format 2_7 with CRC scrambled by a PEI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG
- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by
