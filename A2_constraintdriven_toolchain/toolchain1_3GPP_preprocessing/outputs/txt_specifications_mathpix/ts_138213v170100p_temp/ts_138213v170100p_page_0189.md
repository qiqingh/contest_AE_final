index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block. The SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon for FR1 and FR2-1 and same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH block for FR2-2. In Tables 13-7, 13-8, and 13-10, \( k_{\text {SSB }} \) is defined in \( [4 \), TS 38.211].

For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE determines an offset from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block
- according to the offset in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and
- according to a sum of a first offset and a second offset if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block is provided by ssbFrequency in a measurement configuration associated with a reporting configuration providing reportCGI and does not correspond to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.1011], where
- the first offset is provided in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, and
- the second offset is determined as the offset from a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the SS/PBCH block indicated in the measurement configuration to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of a SS/PBCH block hypothetically located at the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry, where the single synchronization raster entry is located in the same channel as the SS/PBCH block used for the shared spectrum channel access procedure, as described in [15, TS 37.213]
where the offsets are defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set that is same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH block.

For operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over two slots. For SS/PBCH block with index \( i \), the UE determines an index of slot \( n_{0} \) as \( n_{0}=\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor i \cdot M\rfloor\right) \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame } \mu} \) that is in a frame with system frame number (SFN) SFN \( { }_{\mathrm{C}} \) satisfying \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\mathrm{c}} \bmod 2=0 \) if \( \left\lfloor\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor i \cdot M\rfloor\right) / N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {fram }{ }^{\mu}, \mu}\right\rfloor \bmod 2=0 \), or in a frame with SFN satisfying \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\mathrm{c}} \bmod 2=1 \) if \( \left\lfloor\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor i \cdot M\rfloor\right) / N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}\right\rfloor \bmod 2=1 \) where \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3,5,6\} \) based on the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211].
- For \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \) and for a SS/PBCH block index \( i \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 \) are provided by Table 13-11 and Table 13-12.
- For \( \mu=5 \) and for a SS/PBCH block index \( i \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+4 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+ \) 4 are provided by Table 13-12A, where \( X=1.25 \).
- For \( \mu=6 \) and for a SS/PBCH block index \( i \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+8 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+ \) 8 are provided by Table 13-12A, where \( X=0.625 \).

For operation with shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214]. For a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{\imath} \), where \( 0 \leq \bar{\imath} \leq \bar{L}_{\text {max }}-1 \), two slots include the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions. The UE determines an index of slot \( n_{0} \) as \( n_{0}=\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor\bar{\imath} \cdot M\rfloor\right) \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame } \mu} \) that is in a frame with system frame number (SFN) \( \mathrm{SFN}_{C} \) satisfying \( \mathrm{SFN}_{C} \bmod 2=0 \) if \( \left\lfloor\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor\bar{\imath} \cdot M\rfloor\right) /\right. \left.N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}\right] \bmod 2=0 \), or in a frame with SFN satisfying SFN \( { }_{C} \bmod 2=1 \) if \( \left\lfloor\left(O \cdot 2^{\mu}+\lfloor\bar{l} \cdot M\rfloor\right) / N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}\right\rfloor \bmod 2=1 \) where \( \mu \in\{0,1,3,5,6\} \) based on the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211].
- For \( \mu \in\{0,1\} \) and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index \( \bar{l} \), the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 . M, O \), and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots \( n_{0} \) and \( n_{0}+1 \) are provided by Table 13-11. The UE does not expect to be configured with \( M=1 / 2 \), or with \( M=2 \), when \( N_{S S B}^{Q C L}=1 \).
