- When the procedures are applied for the primary PUCCH group, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the primary PUCCH group.
- When the procedures are applied for the secondary PUCCH group, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the secondary PUCCH group. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group. If pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup-r16 is provided, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is replaced by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgrouprl6.

For unpaired spectrum operation, if the UE is provided a PUCCH-sSCell by pucch-sSCell as described in clause 9.A, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both the primary cell and the PUCCH-sSCell.
7.2.1 UE behaviour

If a UE transmits a PUCCH on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) in the primary cell \( c \) using PUCCH power control adjustment state with index \( l \), the UE determines the PUCCH transmission power \( P_{\text {PUCCH }, b, f, c}\left(i, q_{u}, q_{d}, l\right) \) in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \) as
\[
\begin{aligned}
P_{\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c}\left(i, q_{u}, q_{d}, /\right)=\min \{ & \left.\begin{array}{l}
P_{\mathrm{CMAX}, f, c}(i), \\
P_{\mathrm{O} \_\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c}\left(q_{u}\right)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu}, M_{\mathrm{RE}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}}(i)\right)+P L_{b_{1}, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+\Delta_{\mathrm{F} \_\mathrm{PUCCH}}(F)+\Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i)+g_{b_{1}, f, c}(i, /)
\end{array}\right\} \\
& \quad[\mathrm{dBm}]
\end{aligned}
\]
where
- \( P_{\text {CMAX }_{1} f, c}(i) \) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS38.101-2] and [8-3, TS38.101-3] for carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \)
- \( P_{0 \_ \text {PUCCH }, b, f, c}\left(q_{u}\right) \) is a parameter composed of the sum of a component \( P_{0 \_N O M I N A L, P U C C H} \), provided by p 0 -nominal, or \( P_{0 \_N O M I N A L} \) PUCCH \( =0 \mathrm{dBm} \) if \( p 0 \)-nominal is not provided, for carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) and, if provided, a component \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUCCH }}\left(q_{u}\right) \) provided by p0-PUCCH-Value in P0-PUCCH for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \), where \( 0 \leq q_{u}<Q_{u}-Q_{u} \) is a size for a set of \( P_{O_{-} U E \_P U C C H} \) values provided by maxNrofPUCCH\( P 0 \)-PerSet. The set of \( P_{\mathrm{O} \_ \text {UE_PUCCH }} \) values is provided by p0-Set. If \( p 0 \)-Set is not provided to the UE, \( P_{0 \_ \text {РШССН }, b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{u}\right)=0,0 \leq q_{u}<Q_{u} \)
- If the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE obtains a mapping, by an index provided by p0-PUCCH-Id, between a set of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold values and set of p0-PUCCH-Value values. If the UE is provided more than one values for pucch-SpatialRelationInfold and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of pucch-SpatialRelationInfold, the UE determines the p0-PUCCH-Value value through the link to a corresponding \( p 0-P U C C H-I d \) index. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot \( k+3 \cdot N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame }, \mu} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH
- If the UE is provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and the UE receives an activation command [11, TS 38.321 ] indicating one or two of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines p0-PUCCH-Value value according to the corresponding one or two sets of power control parameters. The UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot \( k+ 3 \cdot N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame, } \mu} \) where \( k \) is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.
- If the UE is not provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo and is not provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, the UE obtains the \( p 0-P U C C H-V a l u e \) value from the PO-PUCCH with \( p 0-P U C C H-I d \) value equal to the minimum \( p 0-P U C C H-I d \) value in \( p 0-S e t \)
- \( \quad M_{\mathrm{RB}, b_{1} f, c}^{\mathrm{PUCC}}(i) \) is a bandwidth of the PUCCH resource assignment expressed in number of resource blocks for PUCCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) and \( \mu \) is a SCS configuration defined in [4, TS 38.211]
- \( P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB calculated by the UE using RS resource index \( q_{d} \) as described in clause 7.1.1 for the active DL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of the primary cell \( c \) as described in clause 12
