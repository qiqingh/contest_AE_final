- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms 'secondary cell', 'secondary cells', 'serving cell', 'serving cells' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.
- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms 'secondary cell', 'secondary cells', 'serving cell', 'serving cells' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

A UE configured for operation in bandwidth parts (BWPs) of a serving cell, is configured by higher layers for the serving cell a set of at most four bandwidth parts (BWPs) for receptions by the UE (DL BWP set) in a DL bandwidth by parameter BWP-Downlink or by parameter mitialDownlinkBWP with a set of parameters configured by BWPDownlinkCommon and BWP-DownlinkDedicated, and a set of at most four BWPs for transmissions by the UE (UL BWP set) in an UL bandwidth by parameter BWP-Uplink or by parameter initialUplinkBWP with a set of parameters configured by BWP-UplinkCommon and BWP-UplinkDedicated.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE expects that the BWP configured by the parameter initialUplinkBWP provided in UplinkConfigCommonSIB is mapped to only a single RB set.

If a UE is not provided initialDownlinkBWP, an initial DL BWP is defined by a location and number of contiguous PRBs, starting from a PRB with the lowest index and ending at a PRB with the highest index among PRBs of a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and a SCS and a cyclic prefix for PDCCH reception in the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set; otherwise, the initial DL BWP is provided by initialDownlinkBWP. For operation on the primary cell or on a secondary cell, a UE is provided an initial UL BWP by initialUplinkBWP. If the UE is configured with a supplementary UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial UL BWP on the supplementary UL carrier by initialUplinkBWP.

If a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP for receptions and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a carrier of the primary cell.

For each DL BWP or UL BWP in a set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs, respectively, the UE is provided the following parameters for the serving cell as defined in [4, TS 38.211] or [6, TS 38.214]:
- a SCS by subcarrierSpacing
- a cyclic prefix by cyclicPrefix
- a common RB \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {start }}=O_{\text {carrier }}+R B_{\text {start }} \) and a number of contiguous RBs \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }}=L_{\mathrm{RB}} \) provided by locationAndBandwidth that indicates an offset \( R B_{\text {start }} \) and a length \( L_{\mathrm{RB}} \) as RIV according to [6, TS 38.214], setting \( N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }}=275 \), and a value \( O_{\text {carrier }} \) provided by offsetToCarrier for the subcarrierSpacing
- an index in the set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs by respective BWP-Id
- a set of BWP-common and a set of BWP-dedicated parameters by BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWPDownlinkDedicated for the DL BWP, or BWP-UplinkCommon and BWP-UplinkDedicated for the UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]

For unpaired spectrum operation, a DL BWP from the set of configured DL BWPs with index provided by BWP-Id is linked with an UL BWP from the set of configured UL BWPs with index provided by BWP-Id when the DL BWP index and the UL BWP index are same. For unpaired spectrum operation, a UE does not expect to receive a configuration where the center frequency for a DL BWP is different than the center frequency for an UL BWP when the BWP-Id of the DL BWP is same as the BWP-Id of the UL BWP.

For each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in clause 10.1. The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the PCell in the active DL BWP.

If a UE is provided controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigSIBl or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a search space set from controlResourcesetZero as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions for the search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP.
