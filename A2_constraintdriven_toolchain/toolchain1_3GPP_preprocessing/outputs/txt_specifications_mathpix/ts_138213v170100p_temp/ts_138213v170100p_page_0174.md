And if another cell among the cells configured with directionalCollisionHandling-r 16 operates in the same frequency band as the reference cell, the UE does not expect
- a symbol to be indicated as downlink or uplink on the reference cell and as uplink or downlink on another cell, respectively, by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated,
- tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to indicate a symbol as downlink on the reference cell and to detect a DCI format scheduling a transmission on the symbol on another cell, and
- to be configured by higher layers to receive \( \mathrm{PDCCH}, \mathrm{PDSCH} \), or CSI-RS on a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to detect a DCI format scheduling a transmission on the symbol on another cell,
if the reference cell and another cell among the cells configured with directionalCollisionHanding-r 16 operate in different frequency bands,
the UE
- assumes symbol as flexible, is not required to receive higher layer configured PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS and not expected to transmit higher layer configured SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH, when tdd-UL-DLConfiguration Common or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated indicates symbol as downlink or uplink on another cell and as uplink or downlink for the reference cell, respectively,
- transmits a signal/channel scheduled by a DCI format on a symbol of another cell when the symbol is indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated for the reference cell,
- is not required to receive a higher layer configured \( \mathrm{PDCCH}, \mathrm{PDSCH} \), or CSI-RS on flexible symbols on the reference cell in a set of symbols, if the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a transmission on one or more symbols in the set of symbols on another cell,
and regardless of whether the reference cell and another cell operate in same or different frequency bands,
the UE
- does not expect tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated for the reference cell to indicate a symbol as uplink and to detect a DCI format scheduling a reception on the symbol on another cell
- does not expect to be configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH on a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to detect a DCI format scheduling a reception on the symbol on another cell
- does not transmit a PUCCH, PUSCH or PRACH that is configured by higher layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol from the set of symbols is indicated as downlink by \( t d d-U L-D L- \) Configuration Common or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated or is a symbol corresponding to a PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS reception that is configured by higher layers on the reference cell
- does not transmit a SRS that is configured by higher layers on a set of symbols on another cell if the set of symbols is indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated or corresponds to a PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS reception that is configured by higher layers on the reference cell
- does not receive a PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS that is configured by higher layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol from the set of symbols is indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated or is a symbol corresponding to a SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH transmission that is configured by higher layers on the reference cell
- assumes a symbol indicated as downlink or uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated on another cell to be flexible, if the UE is respectively configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH or to receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS on the reference cell
- does not expect to detect a first DCI format scheduling a transmission or reception on a symbol on a first cell and a second DCI format scheduling a reception or transmission on the symbol on a second cell, respectively.

After the UE applies the procedures described above for directional collision handling within the set of cells that have been configured with directionalCollisionHanding-r16, the UE does not expect any directional collision among the serving cells that the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission and reception.
