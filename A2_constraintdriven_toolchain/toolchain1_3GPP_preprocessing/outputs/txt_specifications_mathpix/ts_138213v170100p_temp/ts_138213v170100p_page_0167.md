- a '01' value for the bits indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 , if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r17
- a '10' value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the first value in the set of durations
- a '11' value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the second value in the set of durations

When the PDCCH monitoring adaptation field indicates to a UE to start PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a first group index and stop PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a second group index, the UE applies the indication
- at the beginning of a first slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format with the PDCCH monitoring adaptation field when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \),
- at the beginning of a first slot, of a slot group of \( X_{s} \) slots, that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format with the PDCCH monitoring adaptation field when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \)

When the PDCCH monitoring adaptation field indicates to a UE to skip PDCCH monitoring for a duration on the active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE starts skipping of PDCCH monitoring at the beginning of a first slot that is after the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format with the PDCCH monitoring adaptation field.

If a UE is provided group indexes for a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or a USS set by searchSpaceGroupldList-r17 and a timer value by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17 for PDCCH monitoring an active DL BWP of on a serving cell and the timer is running, the UE
- resets the timer after a slot of the active DL BWP of the serving cell if the UE detects a DCI format in a PDCCH reception in the slot for with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI
- otherwise, decrements the timer value by one after a slot of the active DL BWP of the serving cell

When the timer expires in a first slot, the UE monitors PDCCH on the serving cell according to search space sets with group index 0 starting in a second slot that
- is not earlier than \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the first slot when \( \mu \in\{0,1,2,3\} \),
- is a first slot in a slot group of \( X_{s} \) slots that is not earlier than \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the first slot when \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \),
- is not earlier than a slot where a PDCCH skipping duration expires, if applicable

When a UE receives
- a first PDCCH in a first slot that provides a DCI format with a PDCCH monitoring adaptation field having a first value indicating skipping PDCCH monitoring, or indicating start of PDCCH monitoring according to a search space sets with a first group index and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a second group index, for an active DL BWP and
- a second PDCCH that provides a DCI format with a PDCCH monitoring adaptation field having a second value indicating skipping PDCCH monitoring, or indicating start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a first group index and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a second group index different than the first group index, for the active DL BWP where the second PDCCH is received
- in the first slot if the first value indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring
- before a slot that is at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after the first slot if the first value indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with a first group index
the UE does not expect the second value to be different than the first value.
A UE does not expect to receive in a second slot a PDCCH on an active DL BWP that provides a DCI format indicating skipping PDCCH monitoring, or start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 or 2 for the active DL BWP, if the second slot is not at least \( P_{\text {switch }} \) symbols after a first slot where the timer expires.
