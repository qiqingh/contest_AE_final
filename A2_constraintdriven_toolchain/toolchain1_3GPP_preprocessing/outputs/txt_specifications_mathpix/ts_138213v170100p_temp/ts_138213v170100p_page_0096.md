The UE appends the HARQ-ACK information corresponding to SPS PDSCH receptions, if any, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, after the first and second, if any, HARQ-ACK information.

If the HARQ-ACK information is multiplexed in a PUSCH transmission, the HARQ-ACK information is determined as
- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \), if the PUSCH transmission is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include a DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \)
- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \), if the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without ul-TotalDAI-Included configured except that for PDSCH group \( g \), the DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) in the DCI format is used after the completion of the \( c \) and \( m \) loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \) does not include HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH group \( (g+1) \bmod 2 \)
- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \), if the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without \( u \)-TotalDAI-Included configured except that for PDSCH group \( g=0 \), the DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) in the DCI format is used after the completion of the \( c \) and \( m \) loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \) includes HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH groups \( g \) and \( (g+1) \bmod 2 \)
- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \), if the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without \( u \)-TotalDAI-Included configured except that for PDSCH group \( g=0 \), the DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DA}}^{\mathrm{LL}} \) in the DCI format is used after the completion of the \( c \) and \( m \) loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions, and the UE has not detected any DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK information for any PDSCH group
- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion \( i(g) \), if the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format with \( u \) l-TotalDAI-Included configured except that MSBs of the DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) in the DCI format are used for PDSCH group \( g=0 \), and LSBs of DCI field with value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}} \) in the DCI format are used for PDSCH group \( g=1 \), after the completion of the \( c \) and \( m \) loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1.

If a UE is scheduled a PUSCH transmission by DCI format 01 having a DAI field value \( V_{\mathrm{DAI}}^{\mathrm{UL}}=4 \) for a PDSCH group index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions for the PDSCH group index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH group index, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission for the PDSCH group index.

If a UE detects DCI formats with respective PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing field values indicating a same PUCCH transmission occasion and none of the DCI formats that the UE detects after a last PUCCH transmission occasion for \( g=0 \) includes a New feedback indicator field for \( g=0 \), and at least one of the DCI formats is DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for PDSCH receptions scheduled by detections of DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) and SPS PDSCH releases indicated by detections of DCI format 1.0 , as described in clause 9.1.3.1 or 9.1.3.2 for multiplexing in the PUCCH transmission occasion.

If a DCI format indicating a slot for a PUCCH transmission occasion does not include a New feedback indicator field, a PDSCH reception scheduled by the DCI format or a SPS PDSCH release indicated by the DCI format is associated with
