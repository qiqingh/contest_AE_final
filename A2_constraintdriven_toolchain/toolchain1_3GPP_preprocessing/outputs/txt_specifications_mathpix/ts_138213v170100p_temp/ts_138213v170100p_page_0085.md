- slot offsets \( K_{0} \) [6, TS 38.214] provided by time domain resource assignment field in a DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions and by pdsch-AggregationFactor, or pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16, or repetitionNumber, when provided.

The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI formats scheduling PDSCH receptions, or having associated HARQACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, is defined as the union of PDCCH monitoring occasions across active DL BWPs of configured serving cells. PDCCH monitoring occasions are indexed in an ascending order of their start times. The cardinality of the set of PDCCH monitoring occasions defines a total number \( M \) of PDCCH monitoring occasions.

A value of the counter downlink assignment indicator (DAI) field in DCI formats denotes the accumulative number of \{serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion\}-pairs in which PDSCH receptions, or HARQ-ACK information bits that are not in response for PDSCH receptions, associated with the DCI formats, excluding the SPS activation DCI, is present up to the current serving cell and current PDCCH monitoring occasion,
- first, if the UE indicates by type2-HARQ-ACK-Codebook support for more than one PDSCH reception on a serving cell that are scheduled from a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, in increasing order of the PDSCH reception starting time for the same \{serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion) pair,
- second in ascending order of serving cell index, and
- third in ascending order of PDCCH monitoring occasion index \( m \), where \( 0 \leq m<M \).

If, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided ackNackFeedbackMode \( = \) joint, the value of the counter DAI is in the order of the first CORESETs and then the second CORESETs for a same serving cell index and a same PDCCH monitoring occasion index.

The value of the total DAI, when present [5, TS 38.212], in a DCI format denotes the total number of serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion\}-pair(s) in which PDSCH reception(s), or HARQ-ACK information that does not correspond to PDSCH receptions, associated with DCI formats, excluding the SPS activation DCI, is present, up to the current PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) and is updated from PDCCH monitoring occasion to PDCCH monitoring occasion. If, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided ackNackFeedbackMode = joint, the total DAI value counts the \{serving cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion\}-pair(s) for both the first CORESETs and the second CORESETs.

Denote by \( N_{C-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) the number of bits for the counter DAl and set \( T_{D}=2^{N_{C-\mathrm{DAl}}^{\mathrm{DL}}} \). Denote by \( V_{\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{DAl}, c, m}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) the value of the counter DAI in a DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, on serving cell \( c \) in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) according to Table 9.1.3-1 or Table 9.1.3-1A. Denote by \( V_{\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DAl}, m}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) the value of the total DAI in a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \) according to Table 9.1.3-1. The UE assumes a same value of total DAI in all DCI formats that include a total DAI field in PDCCH monitoring occasion \( m \). A UE does not expect to multiplex, in a same Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook, HARQ-ACK information that is in response to detection of DCI formats with different number of bits for the counter DAI field.

If the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot \( n \) and for any PUCCH format, the UE determines the \( \tilde{o}_{0}^{A C K}, \tilde{o}_{1}^{A C K}, \cdots, \tilde{o}_{O_{\mathrm{ACK}}-1}^{A C K} \), for a total number of \( O_{\mathrm{ACK}} \) HARQ-ACK information bits, according to the following pseudocode:

Set \( m=0-\mathrm{PDCCH} \), with DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception, monitoring occasion index: lower index corresponds to earlier PDCCH monitoring occasion

Set \( j=0 \)
Set \( V_{\text {temp }}=0 \)
Set \( V_{\text {temp } 2}=0 \)
Set \( V_{s}=\emptyset \)
Set \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) to the number of serving cells configured by higher layers for the UE
