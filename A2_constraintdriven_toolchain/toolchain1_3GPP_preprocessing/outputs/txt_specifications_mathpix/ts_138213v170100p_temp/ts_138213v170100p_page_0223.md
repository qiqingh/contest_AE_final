- for one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of "01"
- generate ACK if the UE determines ACK from at least one PSFCH reception occasion, from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions, in PSFCH resources corresponding to every identity \( M_{\text {ID }} \) of the UEs that the UE expects to receive the PSSCH, as described in clause 16.3; otherwise, generate NACK
- for one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-B or SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of " 11 "
- generate ACK when the UE determines absence of PSFCH reception for the last PSFCH reception occasion from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions; otherwise, generate NACK

After a UE transmits PSSCHs and receives PSFCHs in corresponding PSFCH resource occasions, the priority value of HARQ-ACK information is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmissions that is associated with the PSFCH reception occasions providing the HARQ-ACK information.

The UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization, as described in clause 16.2.4, the UE does not receive PSFCH in any PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission in a resource provided by a DCI format \( 3-0 \) or, for a configured grant, in a resource provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission.

The UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization as described in clause 16.2.4, the UE does not transmit a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format 3.0 or, for a configured grant, in any of the resources provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH that was not transmitted due to prioritization.

The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a configured grant in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the configured grant.

The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the dynamic grant.

For reporting HARQ-ACK information on uplink corresponding to one or multiple PSSCH transmissions with a corresponding SCI format with the field 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' set to disabled, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with the contents instructed by higher layer. The priority value of the HARQ-ACK information is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission.

A UE does not expect to be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources to report HARQ-ACK information that start earlier than \( T_{\text {prep }}=(N+1) \cdot(2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{c} \) after the end of a last symbol of a last PSFCH reception occasion, from a number of PSFCH reception occasions that the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission, where
- \( \kappa \) and \( T_{c} \) are defined in [4, TS 38.211]
- \( \mu=\min \left(\mu_{S L}, \mu_{U L}\right) \), where \( \mu_{S L} \) is the SCS configuration of the SLBWP and \( \mu_{U L} \) is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP on the primary cell
- \( N \) is determined from \( \mu \) according to Table 16.5-1
