associated with the next overlapping slot with subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols for PUCCH transmissions with the larger priority index
- the UE does not expect a PUCCH transmission that includes UCI of different priority indexes to overlap with a PUCCH transmission with \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) repetitions after resolving the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions without repetitions within a slot
- the UE does not expect a PUCCH transmission with UCI of first and second priority indexes to overlap with a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information of the first priority index, or with a PUCCH transmission or with a PUSCH transmission of the second priority index when the second priority index is larger than the first priority index
- the UE does not expect a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information of larger priority index to overlap with more than one PUCCH transmissions with HARQ-ACK information of smaller priority index
- third, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions of different priority indexes
- the UE drops PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority index that overlap with a PUCCH transmission with positive SR of larger priority index prior to multiplexing UCI in a PUSCH transmission of smaller priority index, if any
- the UE drops PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority index that overlap with a PUCCH transmission with \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) repetitions of larger priority index prior to multiplexing UCI in a PUSCH transmission of smaller priority index, if any
- the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission, as is subsequently described in this clause for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information from a PUCCH transmission in a PUSCH transmission of a same priority index, if a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information of a first priority index overlaps with one or more PUSCH transmissions of a second priority index that is different than the first priority index
- if \( / / \) this is for cases the UE supports multiplexing information of different priorities in a PUCCH/PUSCH transmission
- a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, without repetitions, with smaller priority index overlaps with a PUCCH transmission only with HARQ-ACK information, without repetitions, with larger priority index, or
- a PUCCH transmission without repetitions that includes HARQ-ACK information of smaller priority index overlaps with a PUCCH transmission without repetitions using a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 2/3/4 with HARQ-ACK information and SR of larger priority index, or
- a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, without repetitions, with smaller or larger priority index overlaps, respectively, with a PUSCH transmission with larger or smaller priority index
the UE
- multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of different priority indexes and SR information of larger priority index, if any, in a same PUCCH transmission of larger priority index, or multiplexes HARQ-ACK information the UE would provide in a PUCCH transmission of smaller or larger priority index in a PUSCH transmission of larger or smaller priority index, respectively, and applies the procedures in clause 9.2.5.3 or 9.3 , respectively, and
- drops CSI and/or SR carried in the PUCCH of smaller priority index, if any
- drops HARQ-ACK information of smaller priority index if the UE would multiplex the HARQ-ACK information of smaller priority index in a PUSCH where the UE multiplexes Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports of larger priority index
- drops Part 2 CSI reports of smaller priority index if the UE would multiplex the HARQ-ACK information of smaller and larger priority indexes in a PUSCH where the UE multiplexes Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports of smaller priority index
- else
