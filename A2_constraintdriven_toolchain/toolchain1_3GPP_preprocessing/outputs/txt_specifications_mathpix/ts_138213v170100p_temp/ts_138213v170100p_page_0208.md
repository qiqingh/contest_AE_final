- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source and target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode,
the UE does not expect transmissions on the target and source cell in overlapping time resources.
For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if
- the UE indicates support of interFreqUL-TransCancellationDAPS-r16, and
- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source and target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode, and
- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in overlapping time resources,
the UE transmits only on the target cell, and cancels the transmission to source cell.
For intra-frequency DAPS handover, if
- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in overlapping time resources,
the UE transmits only on the target cell and cancels the transmission on the source cell.
The UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if a first symbol of the transmission on the source cell is less than \( T_{\text {proc, } 2}+d \) after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE receives a PDCCH providing a DCI format scheduling a transmission on the target cell. \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding PUSCH processing capability [ 6 , TS 38.214] assuming \( d_{2,1}=1, d \) is a time duration corresponding to 2 symbols for SCS configuration \( \mu \), and \( \mu \) is the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH providing the DCI format and the SCS configuration for the transmission on the source cell. If the UE transmits PRACH using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS on the source cell, the UE determines \( T_{\text {proc, } 2} \) assuming SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \).

A UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if the first symbol of the source cell transmission occurs, relative to a last symbol of a PDSCH reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant on the target cell, after a number of symbols that is smaller than \( N_{\mathrm{T}, 1}+N_{\mathrm{T}, 2}+0.5 \mathrm{msec} \), where \( N_{\mathrm{T}, 1} \) is a time duration of \( N_{1} \) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, \( N_{T, 2} \) is a time duration of \( N_{2} \) symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] and the UE considers that \( N_{1} \) and \( N_{2} \) correspond to the smaller of the SCS configurations for the PDSCH on the target cell and the transmission on the source cell. For \( \mu=0 \), the UE assumes \( N_{1,0}=14[6 \), TS 38.214].

For intra-frequency DAPS handover operation, the UE expects that an active DL BWP and an active UL BWP on the target cell are within an active DL BWP and an active UL BWP on the source cell, respectively.

If a UE is provided search space sets on both the target MCG and the source MCG, in any slot the UE does not expect to have USS sets on both the target MCG and the source MCG that result in the number of monitored PDCCH candidates and the total number of non-overlapped CCEs in both cells that each exceed the corresponding maximum numbers per slot defined in Table 10.1-2 and Table 10.1-3.

For DAPS operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS to the source MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a PRACH transmission to the target MCG or when a gap between a first or last symbol of a PRACH transmission to the target MCG in a first slot would be separated by less than \( N \) symbols from a last or first symbol, respectively, of the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission to the source MCG in a second slot. For DAPS operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit PRACH on the source MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission on the target MCG or when a gap between the first or last symbol of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission on the target MCG is separated by less than \( N \) symbols from a last or a first symbol, respectively, of a PRACH transmission on the source MCG. \( N=2 \) for \( \mu=0 \) or \( \mu=1, N=4 \) for \( \mu=2 \) or \( \mu=3 \), and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP for the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission. The PUSCH processing capability is the processing capability of source cell.

A UE is provided by SL-BWP-Config a BWP for SL transmissions (SL BWP) with numerology and resource grid determined as described in [4, TS 38.211]. For a resource pool within the SLBWP, the UE is provided by sl-
