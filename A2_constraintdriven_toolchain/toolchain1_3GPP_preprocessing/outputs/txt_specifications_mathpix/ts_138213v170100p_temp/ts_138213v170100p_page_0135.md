PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot or per span that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 16} \) downlink cells or to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 16} \) downlink cells, respectively, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells } r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 16} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCAI
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1,pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 16} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAI
- else, \( N_{\text {cells, } r 15}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAl from a combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAl, pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-Comblndicator
and
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells } r 16}^{\text {cap-r } 16} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1, pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 16} \) is the value of \( p d c c h \)-BlindDetectionCA2
- else, \( N_{\text {cells, r16 }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 from a combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAl, pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-Comblndicator

If a UE indicates in UE-NR-Capability a carrier aggregation capability larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability or larger than one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r17monitoringcapability, the UE includes in UE-NR-Capability an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability or for downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r 17 monitoringcapability when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability and at least one downlink cell has SCS configuration \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \). When a UE is not configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots that corresponds to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells or to \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) downlink cells, respectively, where
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }, r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17), \( N_{\text {cells } r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap } r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15
- else, \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15 from a combination of (pdcchBlindDetectionCAr15, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-CombIndicator-r17
and
- \( \quad N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the number of configured downlink cells if the UE does not provide pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17
- otherwise,
- if the UE reports only one combination of (pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr15, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17), \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17
- else, \( N_{\text {cells }, r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \) is the value of pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17 from a combination of (pdcchBlindDetectionCAr15, pdcch-BlindDetectionCAr17) that is provided by pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-CombIndicator-r17
