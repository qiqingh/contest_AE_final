If a UE detects a DCI format indicating an active UL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in the scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format indicating an active DL BWP change or an active UL BWP change for a scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2) in a slot other than the first slot of a set of slots for the DL SCS of the scheduling cell that overlaps with a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit, respectively, for an active BWP change in a different cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2).

A UE expects to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active UL BWP change or an active DL BWP change only if a corresponding PDCCH is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot. If the UE detects the DCI format from two PDCCH receptions in search space sets \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) that include searchSpaceLinking with value \( s_{j} \) and \( s_{i} \), respectively, as described in clause 10.1 , the UE considers the PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format to be the one from the two PDCCH receptions that ends later.

For a serving cell, a UE can be provided by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id a default DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a default DL BWP by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id, the default DL BWP is the initial DL BWP.

If a UE is provided by bwp-InactivityTimer a timer value for the serving cell [11, TS 38.321] and the timer is running, the UE decrements the timer at the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a half subframe for FR2 if the restarting conditions in [11, TS 38.321] are not met during the interval of the subframe for FR1 or of the half subframe for FR2.

For a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity timer expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP change or the active UL BWP change required by the UE [10, TS 38.133], the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a subframe for FR2, that is immediately after the BWP inactivity timer expires until the beginning of a slot where the UE can receive or transmit.

When a UE's BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit for an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different cell within FR1 (or FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change triggered by the BWP inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for FR1 or half a subframe for FR2 that is immediately after the UE completes the active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in the different cell within FR1 (or FR2).

If a UE is provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP on the carrier of the secondary cell.

A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH when the UE performs RRM measurements [10, TS 38.133] over a bandwidth that is not within the active DL BWP for the UE.

13 UE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets

If during cell search a UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE determines a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from controlResourceSetZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1, as described in Tables 13-1 through 13-10, for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, or as described in Tables 13-1A and 13-4A for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or as described in Table 13-10A for FR22, and determines PDCCH monitoring occasions from searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIBI, included in MIB, as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. SFN \( { }_{\mathrm{c}} \) and \( n_{\mathrm{c}} \) are the SFN and slot index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and SFN \( \mathrm{SSB}_{i} \) and \( n_{\mathrm{SSB}, i} \) are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively, where the \( \mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH} \) block with index \( i \) overlaps in time with system frame \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\mathrm{SSB}, i} \) and slot \( n_{\mathrm{SSB}, i} \). The symbols of the CORESET associated with pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or with searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCHConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and for operation without shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that the offset in Tables 13-1 through 13-10A is defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set from the smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the smallest RB
