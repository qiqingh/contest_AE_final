10.3 PDCCH monitoring indication and dormancy/non-dormancy behaviour for SCells

A UE configured with DRX mode operation [11, TS 38.321] can be provided the following for detection of a DCI format 2_6 in a PDCCH reception on the PCell or on the SpCell [12, TS 38.331]
- a PS-RNTI for DCI format 2_6 by ps-RNTI
- a number of search space sets, by dci-Format2-6, to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2 _6 on the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell according to a common search space as described in clause 10.1
- a payload size for DCI format 2_6 by sizeDCI-2-6
- a location in DCI format 2_6 of a Wake-up indication bit by ps-PositionDCI-2-6
- a ' 0 ' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher layers, indicates to not start the \( d r x \) onDurationTimer for the next long DRX cycle [11, TS 38.321]
- a ' 1 ' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher layers, indicates to start the \( d r x \) onDurationTimer for the next long DRX cycle [11, TS 38.321]
- a bitmap, when the UE is provided a number of groups of configured SCells by dormancyGroupOutsideActiveTime, where
- the bitmap location is immediately after the Wake-up indication bit location
- the bitmap size is equal to the number of groups of configured SCells where each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells from the number of groups of configured SCells
- a ' 0 ' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided by dormantBWP-Id, for the UE [11, TS38.321] for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells
- a '1' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
- an active DL BWP, provided by firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id, for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP
- a current active DL BWP, for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP is not the dormant DL BWP
- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP
- an offset by \( p s \)-Offset indicating a time, where the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for detection of DCI format 26 according to the number of search space sets, prior to a slot where the drx-onDurationTimer would start on the PCell or on the SpCell [11, TS 38.321]
- for each search space set, the PDCCH monitoring occasions are the ones in the first \( T_{\mathrm{s}} \) slots indicated by duration, or \( T_{\mathrm{s}}=1 \) slot if duration is not provided, starting from the first slot of the first \( T_{\mathrm{s}} \) slots and ending prior to the start of drx-onDurationTimer.
