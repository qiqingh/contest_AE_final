the UE determines a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) providing a periodic RS resource configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in
- the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL BWP, if CORESETs are provided in the active DL BWP of serving cell \( c \). If the CORESET has two activated TCI states, as described in clause 10.1 , the UE determines the RS resource index \( q_{d} \) based on the first TCI state.
- the active PDSCH TCI state with lowest ID [6, TS 38.214] in the active DL BWP, if CORESETs are not provided in the active DL BWP of serving cell \( c \)
- For the SRS power control adjustment state for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and SRS transmission occasion \( i \)
- \( \quad h_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(i, l)=f_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(i, l) \), where \( f_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(i, l) \) is the current PUSCH power control adjustment state as described in clause 7.1.1, if srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates indicates a same power control adjustment state for SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions; or
- \( \quad h_{b, f, c}(i)=h_{b, f, c}\left(i-i_{0}\right)+\sum_{m=0}^{c\left(S_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\text {SRS }, b, f, c}(m) \) if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on active UL

BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), or if srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates indicates separate power control adjustment states between SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, and if tpc-Accumulation is not provided, where
- The \( \delta_{\mathrm{SRS}, b, f, c} \) values are given in Table 7.1.1-1
- \( \quad \delta_{\mathrm{SRS}, b_{1} f, c}(m) \) is jointly coded with other TPC commands in a PDCCH with DCI format 2_3, as described in clause 11.4
- \( \quad \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(S_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\text {SRS }, b_{1}, c_{1} c}(m) \) is a sum of TPC command values in a set \( S_{i} \) of TPC command values with cardinality \( C\left(S_{i}\right) \) that the UE receives between \( K_{S R S}\left(i-i_{0}\right)-1 \) symbols before SRS transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( K_{\text {SRS }}(i) \) symbols before SRS transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) for SRS power control adjustment state, where \( i_{0}>0 \) is the smallest integer for which \( K_{\text {SRS }}(i) \) symbols before SRS transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) is earlier than \( K_{\text {SRS }}\left(i-i_{0}\right) \) symbols before SRS transmission occasion \( i \)
- if the SRS transmission is aperiodic, \( K_{\text {SRS }}(i) \) is a number of symbols for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) after a last symbol of a corresponding PDCCH triggering the SRS transmission and before a first symbol of the SRS transmission
- if the SRS transmission is semi-persistent or periodic, \( K_{S R S}(i) \) is a number of \( K_{S R S, \text { min }} \) symbols equal to the product of a number of symbols per slot, \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \), and the minimum of the values provided by \( k 2 \) in PUSCH-ConfigCommon for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- If the UE has reached maximum power for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) at SRS transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(S_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\mathrm{SRS}, b_{1}, f_{1} c}(m) \geq 0 \), then \( h_{b_{1}, f_{1} c}(i)=h_{b_{1}, c}\left(i-i_{0}\right) \)
- If UE has reached minimum power for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) at SRS transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(S_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\mathrm{SRS}, b_{1} f_{1} c}(m) \leq 0 \), then \( h_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(i)=h_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(i-i_{0}\right) \)
- If a configuration for a \( P_{0 \_ \text {SRS }, b_{1} f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \) value or for a \( \alpha_{\text {SRS }, b_{1} f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \) value for a corresponding SRS power control adjustment state \( l \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) is provided by higher layers - \( \quad h_{b, f, c}(k)=0, k=0,1, \ldots, i \)
- Else - \( h_{b, f, c}(0)=\Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b, f, c}+\delta_{\text {msg } 2, b, f, c} \)
