If an IAB-node is provided an index \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {delta }} \) in a Timing Delta MAC CE [11, TS 38.321] from a serving cell, the IAB-node may assume that \( T_{\mathrm{TA}} / 2+\left(N_{\text {delta }}+T_{\text {delta }} \cdot \mathrm{G}_{\text {step }}-N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { Offset }} / 2\right) \cdot \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}} \) is a time difference between a DU transmission of a signal from the serving cell and a reception of the signal by the [AB-MT when \( T_{\mathrm{TA}} / 2+\left(N_{\text {delta }}+T_{\text {delta }}\right. \). \( \left.\mathrm{G}_{\text {step }}-N_{\mathrm{TA}_{\mathrm{A}}, \text { Offset }} / 2\right) \cdot \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}}>0 \), where
- \( T_{\mathrm{TA}} \) is the difference between the IAB-MT reception time and the IAB-MT transmission time for IAB-MT transmission timing mode 'Case6', and is defined in clause 4.3 .1 of [4, TS 38.211] for IAB-MT transmission timing mode 'Casel' and parent node reception mode 'Case7'
- \( \quad N_{\text {delta }} \) and \( \mathrm{G}_{\text {step }} \) are determined as
- \( N_{\text {deta }}=-70528 \) and \( G_{\text {step }}=64 \), if the serving cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR1
- \( \quad N_{\text {deta }}=-17664 \) and \( G_{\text {step }}=32 \), if the serving cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR2

The IAB node may assume that a same value of index \( T_{\text {delta }} \) is provided from a serving cell for the IAB-MT transmission timing modes 'Case7' and 'Case1'

The IAB-node may use the time difference to determine a DU transmission time.
For a serving cell of an IAB-MT, the IAB-MT can be provided by Timing Case Indication MAC CE [11, TS 38.321] an indication of the [AB-MT transmission timing mode in a slot. Upon reception of the Timing Case Indication for a serving cell in a TAG, the [AB-MT applies a same [AB-MT transmission timing mode in a slot on all serving cells in the TAG.

If the indicated IAB-MT transmission timing mode in a slot is set to 'Casel', the IAB-MT transmission time is determined as for a "UE" in clause 4.2.

If the indicated IAB-MT transmission timing mode in a slot is set to 'Case6', the IAB-node sets the IAB-MT transmission time to the transmission time of the IAB-DU.

If the indicated IAB-MT transmission timing mode in a slot is set to 'Case 7', the IAB-MT is provided a timing advance offset value \( N_{\text {TA, offset, } 2} \) for a serving cell by 'Case7' Timing Advance Offset MAC CE [11, TS 38.321]. The [AB-MT determines its uplink transmission timing as ( \( N_{\mathrm{TA}}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }, 2} \) ) \( \cdot \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}} \) where \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) and \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }} \) are obtained as for a "UE" in clause 4.2 and \( N_{\text {TA,offset, } 2}=T_{\text {offset, } 2} \cdot 16 \cdot 64 / 2^{\mu} \) where \( T_{\text {offset, } 2} \) is provided by the 'Case7' Timing Advance Offset MAC CE [11, TS 38.321].

A slot format for an [AB-DU or an [AB-MT includes downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols.
For each cell of an IAB-DU, the IAB-DU can be provided an indication for a slot format over a number of slots by gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration [16, TS 38.473].

For each serving cell, an IAB-MT can be provided an indication for a slot format over a number of slots by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT. If the [AB-MT is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT, the statements in clause 11.1 that include "tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated" apply to the IAB-MT of an IAB node by replacing "tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated" with "tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT" for the IAB-MT, except that the tdd-UL-DL-Configuration Dedicated-IAB-MT provides
- a set of slot configurations by slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList-IAB-MT
- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations
