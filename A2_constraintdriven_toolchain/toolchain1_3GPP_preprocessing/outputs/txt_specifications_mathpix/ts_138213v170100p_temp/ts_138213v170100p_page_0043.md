- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE expects to be configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA by tdm-PatternConfig in [13, TS 36.213].
7.6.1A NE-DC

If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access and with a SCG using E-UTRA radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{NR}} \) for transmissions in FR1 on the MCG by \( p-N R-F R I \) and a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{LTE}} \) for transmissions on the SCG by p-MaxEUTRA.

The UE determines transmission power for the MCG in FR1 as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using \( P_{\mathrm{NR}} \) as the maximum transmission power for \( P_{\mathrm{CMAX}} \leq P_{\mathrm{NR}} \). The UE determines transmission power for the MCG in FR2 as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

If the UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the MCG, the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in [13, TS 36.213] using \( P_{\text {LTE }} \) as the maximum transmission power.

If at least one symbol of slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG that is indicated as uplink or flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated overlaps with subframe \( i_{2} \) of the SCG
- for subframe \( i_{2} \), the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in [13, TS 36.213] using \( P_{\text {LTE }} \) as the maximum transmission power
otherwise
- the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in [13, TS 36.213] without considering \( P_{\text {LTE }} \) as the maximum transmission power

If a UE is configured with \( \hat{P}_{\text {LTE }}+\hat{P}_{\text {NR }}>\hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {NE-DC }} \), where \( \hat{P}_{\text {LTE }} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\text {LTE }}, \hat{P}_{\text {NR }} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\mathrm{NR}} \), and \( \hat{P}_{\mathrm{Tolal}}^{\mathrm{NE}-\mathrm{DC}} \) is the linear value of a configured maximum transmission power for NE-DC operation as defined in [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for FR1, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG as follows
- If the UE is configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA (by tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r 15 in [13, TS 36.213])
- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC, the UE does not expect to transmit in a slot on the MCG in FR1 when a corresponding subframe on the SCG is an UL subframe in the reference TDD configuration.
- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC and
- if the UE transmission(s) in slot \( i_{1} \) of the MCG in FR1 overlap in time with UE transmission(s) in subframe \( i_{2} \) of the SCG, and
