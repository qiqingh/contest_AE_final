11.1.1 UE procedure for determining slot format

This clause applies for a serving cell that is included in a set of serving cells configured to a UE by slotFormatCombToAddModList and slotFormatCombToReleaseList, availableRB-SetsToAddModList and availableRBSetsToReleaseList, switchTriggerToAddModList and switchTriggerToReleaseList, or coDurationsPerCellToAddModList and co-DurationsPerCellToReleaseList.

If a UE is configured by higher layers with parameter SlotFormatIndicator, the UE is provided an SF[-RNTI by sfiRNTI and with a payload size of DCI format \( 2-0 \) by dci-PayloadSize.

The UE is also provided in one or more serving cells with a configuration for a search space set \( s \) and a corresponding CORESET \( p \) for monitoring \( M_{p, s}^{\left(L_{\mathrm{SFI}}\right)} \) PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) with a CCE aggregation level of \( L_{\mathrm{SFI}} \) CCEs as described in clause 10.1. The \( M_{p, s}^{\left(L_{\mathrm{SFI}}\right)} \) PDCCH candidates are the first \( M_{p, s}^{\left(L_{\mathrm{SFI}}\right)} \) PDCCH candidates for CCE aggregation level \( L_{\text {SFI }} \) for search space set \( s \) in CORESET \( p \).

For each serving cell in the set of serving cells, the UE can be provided:
- an identity of the serving cell by servingCellld
- a location of a SFI-index field in DCI format 2 _ 0 by positionInDCI
- a set of slot format combinations by slotFormatCombinations, where each slot format combination in the set of slot format combinations includes
- one or more slot formats indicated by a respective slotFormats for the slot format combination, and
- a mapping for the slot format combination provided by slotFormats to a corresponding SF[-index field value in DCI format 2 _ 0 provided by slotFormatCombinationId
- for unpaired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}} \) by subcarrierSpacing and, when a supplementary UL carrier is configured for the serving cell, a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI,SUL }} \) by subcarrierSpacing2 for the supplementary UL carrier
- for paired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFIDL }} \) for a DL BWP by subcarrierSpacing and a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \) for an UL BWP by subcarrierSpacing 2
- a location of an available RB set indicator field in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) that is
- one bit, if intraCellGuardBandsDL-List for the serving cell indicates no intra-cell guard-bands are configured, where a value of ' 1 ' indicates that the serving cell is available for receptions, a value of ' 0 ' indicates that the serving cell is not available for receptions, by availableRB-SetsPerCell, and the serving cell remains available or unavailable for reception until the end of the remaining channel occupancy duration
- a bitmap having a one-to-one mapping with the \( \operatorname{RB} \) sets \( [6, T S 38.214] \) of the serving cell, if intraCellGuardBandsDL-List for the serving cell indicates intra-cell guard-bands are configured, where the bitmap includes \( N_{\mathrm{RB}, \text { set, DL }} \) bits and \( N_{\mathrm{RB}, \text { set, DL }} \) is the number of RB sets in the serving cell, a value of ' 1 ' indicates that an RB set is available for receptions, a value of ' 0 ' indicates that an RB set is not available for receptions, by availableRB-SetsPerCell and a RB set remains available or unavailable for receptions until the end of the remaining channel occupancy duration
- a location of a channel occupancy duration field in DCI format 2 _0, by CO-DurationsPerCell, that indicates a remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell starting from a first symbol of a slot where the UE detects the DCI format \( 2-0 \) by providing a value from co-DurationList. The channel occupancy duration field includes \( \max \left\{\left[\log _{2}(\operatorname{COdurationListSize})\right], 1\right\} \) bits, where COdurationListSize is the number of values provided by co-DurationList. If CO-DurationsPerCell is not provided, the remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell is a number of slots, starting from the slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2 , 0 , that the SFIindex field value provides corresponding slot formats
- a reference SCS configuration for co-DurationList, by subcarrierSpacing-r16
- a location of a search space set group switching flag field in DCI format 2 _ 0 , by SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger, that indicates a group from two groups of search space sets for PDCCH monitoring for scheduling for the serving cell or the set of serving cells, provided by CellGroupsForSwitching, as described in clause 10.4.
