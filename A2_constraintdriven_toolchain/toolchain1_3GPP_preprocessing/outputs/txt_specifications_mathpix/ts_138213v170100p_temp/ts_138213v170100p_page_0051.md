- Third, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots

For a PRACH transmission triggered upon request by higher layers, a value of ra-OccasionList [12, TS 38.331], if csirs-ResourceList is provided, indicates a list of PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the selected CSI-RS index indicated by csi-RS. The indexing of the PRACH occasions indicated by ra-OccasionList is reset per association pattern period.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.1-1: Mapping between PRACH configuration period and SS/PBCH block to PRACH occasion association period}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline PRACH configuration period (msec) & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Association period (number of PRACH \\
configuration periods)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline 10 & \( \{1,2,4,8,16\} \) \\
\hline 20 & \( \{1,2,4,8\} \) \\
\hline 40 & \( \{1,2,4\} \) \\
\hline 80 & \( \{1,2\} \) \\
\hline 160 & \( \{1\} \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band all PRACH occasions are valid.
For unpaired spectrum,
- if a UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PRACH occasion in a PRACH slot is valid if it does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PRACH slot and starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block reception symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if channelAccessMode = "semiStatic" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit [15, TS 37.213].
- the candidate SS/PBCH block index of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon, as described in clause 4.1
- If a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PRACH occasion in a PRACH slot is valid if
- it is within UL symbols, or
- it does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PRACH slot and starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last downlink symbol and at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2, and if channelAccessMode = "semiStatic" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where there shall not be any transmissions, as described in [15, TS 37.213]
- the candidate SS/PBCH block index of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon, as described in clause 4.1.

For preamble format B4 [4, TS 38.211], \( N_{\text {gap }}=0 \).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.1-2: \( N_{\text {gap }} \) values for different preamble SCS \( \mu \)}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Preamble SCS & \( \boldsymbol{N}_{\text {gap }} \) \\
\hline 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz & 0 \\
\hline 15 kHz or 30 kHz or 60 kHz or 120 kHz & 2 \\
\hline 480 kHz & 8 \\
\hline 960 kHz & 16 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order, the UE, if requested by higher layers, transmits a PRACH in the selected PRACH occasion, as described in [11, TS 38.321], for which a time between the last symbol of the PDCCH order reception and the first symbol of the PRACH transmission is larger than or equal to \( N_{T, 2}+ \Delta_{\text {BWPSwitching }}+\Delta_{\text {Delay }}+T_{\text {switch }} \mathrm{msec} \), where
- \( N_{T, 2} \) is a time duration of \( N_{2} \) symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] assuming \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH order and the SCS configuration of the corresponding PRACH transmission
