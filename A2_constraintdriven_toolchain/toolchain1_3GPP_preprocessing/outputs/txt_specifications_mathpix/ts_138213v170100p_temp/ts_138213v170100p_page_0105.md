- a first set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \( =0 \) if \( O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq 2 \) including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or
- a second set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \( =1 \), if provided by higher layers, if \( 2<O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq N_{2} \) where \( \mathrm{N}_{2} \) is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId \( =1 \); otherwise \( N_{2} \) is equal to 1706 , or
- a third set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \( =2 \), if provided by higher layers, if \( N_{2}<O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq N_{3} \) where \( \mathrm{N}_{3} \) is equal to maxPayloadSize if maxPayloadSize is provided for the PUCCH resource set with pucchResourceSetId \( =2 \); otherwise \( N_{3} \) is equal to 1706 , or
- a fourth set of PUCCH resources with pucch-ResourceSetld \( =3 \), if provided by higher layers, if \( N_{3}<O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq \) 1706.

If the UE is provided SPS-PUCCH-AN-List and transmits \( O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \mathrm{UCI} \) information bits that include only HARQ-ACK information bits in response to one or more SPS PDSCH receptions and SR, if any, the UE determines a PUCCH resource to be
- a PUCCH resource provided by sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID obtained from the first entry in sps-PUCCH-ANList if \( O_{\text {UCI }} \leq 2 \) including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or
- a PUCCH resource provided by sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID obtained from the second entry in sps-PUCCH\( A N \)-List, if provided, if \( 2<O_{\text {UCI }} \leq N_{1, S P S} \) where \( N_{1, S P S} \) is either provided by maxPayloadSize obtained from the second entry in sps-PUCCH-AN-List or is otherwise equal to 1706 , or
- a PUCCH resource provided by sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID obtained from the third entry in sps-PUCCH-ANList, if provided, if \( N_{1, S P S}<O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq N_{2, S P S} \) where \( N_{2, S P S} \) is either provided by maxPayloadSize obtained from the third entry in sps-PUCCH-AN-List or is otherwise equal to 1706, or
- a PUCCH resource provided by sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID obtained from the fourth entry in sps-PUCCH-ANList, if provided, if \( N_{2, S P S}<O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \leq N_{3, S P S} \) where \( N_{3, S P S} \) is equal to 1706 .
9.2.2 PUCCH Formats for UCI transmission

If a UE is not transmitting PUSCH, and the UE is transmitting UCI, the UE transmits UCI in a PUCCH using
- PUCCH format 0 if
- the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols,
- the number of HARQ-ACK information bits with positive or negative SR (HARQ-ACK/SR bits) is 1 or 2
- PUCCH format 1 if
- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
- the number of HARQ-ACK/SR bits is 1 or 2
- PUCCH format 2 if
- the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols,
- the number of UCI bits is more than 2
- PUCCH format 3 if
- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,
- the PUCCH resource does not include an orthogonal cover code, or the UE is provided useInterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated
