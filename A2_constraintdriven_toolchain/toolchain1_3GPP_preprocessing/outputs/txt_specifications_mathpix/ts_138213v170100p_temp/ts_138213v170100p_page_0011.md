4 Synchronization procedures
4.1 Cell search

Cell search is the procedure for a UE to acquire time and frequency synchronization with a cell and to detect the physical layer Cell ID of the cell.

A UE receives the following synchronization signals (SS) in order to perform cell search: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS) as defined in [4, TS 38.211].

A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical broadcast channel (PBCH), PSS, and SSS are in consecutive symbols, as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and form a SS/PBCH block. The UE assumes that SSS, PBCH DM-RS, and PBCH data have same EPRE. The UE may assume that the ratio of PSS EPRE to SSS EPRE in a SS/PBCH block is either 0 dB or 3 dB . If the UE has not been provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE may assume that the ratio of PDCCH DMRS EPRE to SSS EPRE is within -8 dB and 8 dB when the UE monitors PDCCHs for a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI, or for a DCI format 2 -

For a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks, the first symbol indexes for candidate SS/PBCH blocks are determined according to the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks as follows, where index 0 corresponds to the first symbol of the first slot in a half-frame.
- Case A - 15 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes of \( \{2,8\}+14 \cdot n \).
- For operation without shared spectrum channel access:
- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to \( 3 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1 \).
- For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than \( 3 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1,2,3 \).
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, as described in [15, TS 37.213], \( n=0,1,2,3,4 \).
- Case B - 30 kHz SCS : the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{4,8,16,20\}+28 \cdot n \). For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to \( 3 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0 \). For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 \( \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1 \).
- Case C - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{2,8\}+14 \cdot n \).
- For operation without shared spectrum channel access
- For paired spectrum operation
- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to \( 3 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1 \). For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than \( 3 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1,2,3 \).
- For unpaired spectrum operation
- For carrier frequencies smaller than \( 1.88 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1 \). For carrier frequencies within FR1 equal to or larger than \( 1.88 \mathrm{GHz}, n=0,1,2,3 \).
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, \( n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \).
- Case D - 120 kHz SCS : the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{4,8,16,20\}+28 \cdot n \). For carrier frequencies within \( \mathrm{FR} 2, n=0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,15,16,17 \), 18 .
- Case E - 240 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{8,12,16,20,32,36,40,44\}+56 \cdot n \). For carrier frequencies within \( \mathrm{FR} 2-1, n=0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8 \).
- Case F -480 kHz SCS : the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes \( \{2,9\}+14 \cdot n \). For carrier frequencies within FR2-2, \( n= 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 \).
