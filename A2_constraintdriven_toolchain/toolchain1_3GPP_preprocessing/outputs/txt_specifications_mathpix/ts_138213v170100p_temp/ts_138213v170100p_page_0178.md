For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the UE is provided by subcarrierSpacing a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI }} \) for each slot format in a combination of slot formats indicated by an SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2-0 \). The UE expects that for a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}} \) and for an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \), it is \( \mu \geq \mu_{\text {SFI }} \). Each slot format in the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFIindex field value in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) is applicable to \( 2^{\left(\mu-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}\right)} \) consecutive slots in the active DL BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI }} \) and each downlink or flexible or uplink symbol for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI }} \) corresponds to \( 2^{\left(\mu-\mu_{\text {SFI }}\right)} \) consecutive downlink or flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration \( \mu \).

For paired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the SFI-index field in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) indicates a combination of slot formats that includes a combination of slot formats for a reference DL BWP and a combination of slot formats for a reference UL BWP of the serving cell. The UE is provided by subcarrierSpacing a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI,DL }} \) for the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) for the reference DL BWP of the serving cell. The UE is provided by subcarrierSpacing2 a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \) for the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) for the reference UL BWP of the serving cell. If \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}} \geq \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \) and for each \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}}\right)}+1 \) values provided by a value of slotFormats, where the value of slotFormats is determined by a value of slotFormatCombinationId in slotFormatCombination and the value of slotFormatCombinationId is set by the value of the SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2-0 \), the first \( 2{ }^{\left(\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}}\right)} \) values for the combination of slot formats are applicable to the reference DL BWP and the next value is applicable to the reference UL BWP. If \( \mu_{\text {SFI,DL }}<\mu_{\text {SFI,UL }} \) and for each \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\text {SFI,UL }}-\mu_{\text {SFI,DL }}\right)}+1 \) values provided by slotFormats, the first value for the combination of slot formats is applicable to the reference DL BWP and the next \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\text {SFI,UL }}-\mu_{\text {SFI,DL }}\right)} \) values are applicable to the reference UL BWP.

The UE is provided a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI,DL }} \) so that for an active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {DL }} \), it is \( \mu_{\mathrm{DL}} \geq \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}} \). The UE is provided a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \) so that for an active UL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{UL}} \), it is \( \mu_{\mathrm{UL}} \geq \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \). Each slot format for a combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2-0 \) for the reference DL BWP, by indicating a value for slotFormatCombinationId that is mapped to a value of slotFormats in slotFormatCombination, is applicable to \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\mathrm{DL}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}}\right)} \) consecutive slots for the active DL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference DL BWP and each downlink or flexible symbol for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI DL }} \) corresponds to \( 2{ }^{\left(\mu_{\text {DL }}-\mu_{\text {SFI DL }}\right)} \) consecutive downlink or flexible symbols for the SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{DL}} \). Each slot format for the combination of slot formats for the reference UL BWP is applicable to \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\mathrm{UL}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}}\right)} \) consecutive slots for the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference UL BWP and each uplink or flexible symbol for the reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI, UL }} \) corresponds to \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\text {UL }}-\mu_{\text {SFI,UL }}\right)} \) consecutive uplink or flexible symbols for the SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {UL }} \).

For unpaired spectrum operation with a second UL carrier for a UE on a serving cell, the SFI-index field value in DCI format 20 indicates a combination of slot formats that includes a combination of slot formats for a reference first UL carrier of the serving cell and a combination of slot formats for a reference second UL carrier of the serving cell. The UE is provided by subcarrierSpacing a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI }} \) for the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field in DCI format \( 2-0 \) for the reference first UL carrier of the serving cell. The UE is provided by subcarrierSpacing2 a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFISUL }} \) for the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFIindex field value in DCI format \( 2-0 \) for the reference second UL carrier of the serving cell. For each \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{SUL}}\right)}+1 \) values of slotFormats, the first \( 2^{\left(\mu_{\text {SFI }}-\mu_{\text {SFI,SUL }}\right)} \) values for the combination of slot formats are applicable to the reference first UL carrier and the next value is applicable to the reference second UL carrier.

The UE expects to be provided a reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SFI,SUL }} \) so that for an active UL BWP in the second UL carrier with SCS configuration \( \mu_{\text {SUL }} \), it is \( \mu_{\text {SUL }} \geq \mu_{\text {SFISUL }} \). Each slot format for a combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field in DCI format 2_0 for the reference first UL carrier is applicable to \( 2^{\left(\mu-\mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}\right)} \) consecutive slots for the active DL BWP and the active UL BWP in the first UL carrier where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference first UL carrier. Each slot format for the combination of slot formats for the reference second UL carrier is applicable to \( 2{ }^{\left(\mu_{\text {SUL }}-\mu_{\text {SFI SUL }}\right)} \) consecutive slots for the active UL BWP in the second UL carrier where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference second UL carrier.

If a BWP in the serving cell is configured with \( \mu=2 \) and with extended CP , the UE expects \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}=0, \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}=1 \), or \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}}=2 \). A format for a slot with extended CP is determined from a format for a slot with normal CP. A UE determines an extended CP symbol to be a downlink/uplink/flexible symbol if the overlapping normal CP symbols that are downlink/uplink/flexible symbols, respectively. A UE determines an extended CP symbol to be a flexible symbol if one of the overlapping normal CP symbols is flexible. A UE determines an extended CP symbol to be a flexible symbol if the pair of the overlapping normal CP symbols includes a downlink and an uplink symbol.
