- the second value, associated with the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.228/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value, and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines the second value of \( \alpha_{b_{1}, c}(j) \) from the \( p 0 \)-PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the second SRI field value
- if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes one SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for the SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values and determines the values of \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \) from the \( p 0 \) -PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the SRI field value
- If the UE is not provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and if the PUSCH transmission except for the PUSCH retransmission corresponding to a RAR UL grant is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field, or if SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl is not provided to the UE, \( j=2 \), and the UE determines \( \alpha_{b_{1}, c}(j) \) from the value of the first P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' and the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI field and includes an SRS resource set indicator field with value 10 or 11 , the UE determines \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \) from first and second \( P 0 \) -PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets
- \( M_{\mathrm{RB}, b_{1}, c_{c}}^{\mathrm{PUSC}}(i) \) is the bandwidth of the PUSCH resource assignment expressed in number of resource blocks for PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and \( \mu \) is a SCS configuration defined in [4, TS 38.211]
- \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB calculated by the UE using reference signal (RS) index \( q_{d} \) for the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12 , of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- If the UE is not provided PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS and enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS, or before the UE is provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE calculates \( P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block with same SS/PBCH block index as the one the UE uses to obtain MIB
- If the UE is configured with a number of RS resource indexes, up to the value of maxNrofPUSCHPathlossReferenceRSs, and a respective set of RS configurations for the number of RS resource indexes by PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS, the set of RS resource indexes can include one or both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by ssb-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by csi-RS-Index when a value of a corresponding pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id maps to a CSI-RS resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource index \( q_{d} \) in the set of RS resource indexes to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS resource index as provided by pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id in PUSCHPathlossReferenceRS
- If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a RAR UL grant as described in clause 8.3, or for a PUSCH transmission for Type-2 random access procedure as described in clause 8.1A, the UE uses the same RS resource index \( q_{d} \) as for a corresponding PRACH transmission
- If the UE is provided SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl and more than one values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCHPowerControl between a set of values for the SRI field, or for first and second SRI fields if the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook', or values for a first SRI field and values associated with a second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212] for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field value if the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook', in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission and a set of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id values and determines the RS resource index \( q_{d} \), or respective first and second RS resource indexes \( q_{d} \), from the value of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that is mapped to the SRI field value, or from the values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that are mapped to respective first and second SRI field values if the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook', or from the values of PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id that are mapped to respective
