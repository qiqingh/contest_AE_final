- \( P_{\text {MAX, CBR }} \) is determined by a value of \( s l \)-MaxTxPower based on a priority level of the PSSCH transmission and a CBR range that includes a CBR measured in slot \( i-N[6 \), TS 38.214]; if sl-MaxTxPower is not provided, then \( P_{\text {MAX }, \mathrm{CBR}}=P_{\text {CMAX }} \);
- if dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH is provided
- \( P_{\mathrm{PSSCH}, D}(i)=P_{\mathrm{O}, D}+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PSSCH}}(i)\right)+\alpha_{D} \cdot P L_{D}[\mathrm{dBm}] \)
- else
- \( P_{\mathrm{PSSCH}, D}(i)=\min \left(P_{\mathrm{CMAX}}, P_{\mathrm{MAX}, \mathrm{CBR}}\right)[\mathrm{dBm}] \)
where
- \( \quad P_{0, D} \) is a value of \( d l-P 0-P S S C H-P S C C H \) if provided
- \( \alpha_{D} \) is a value of dl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH, if provided; else, \( \alpha_{D}=1 \)
- \( P L_{D}=P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right) \) when the active SL BWP is on a serving cell \( c \), as described in clause 7.1.1 except that
- the RS resource is the one the UE uses for determining a power of a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) in serving cell \( c \) when the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) in serving cell \( c \)
- the RS resource is the one corresponding to the \( \mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH} \) block the UE uses to obtain MIB when the UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) in serving cell \( c \)
- \( \quad M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PSSCH}}(i) \) is a number of resource blocks for the PSSCH transmission occasion \( i \) and \( \mu \) is a SCS configuration
- if \( s i-P 0-P S S C H-P S C C H \) is provided and if a SCI format scheduling the PSSCH transmission includes a cast type indicator field indicating unicast or is SCI format 2-C
- \( P_{\mathrm{PSSCH}, S L}(i)=P_{\mathrm{O}, S L}+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PSSCH}}(i)\right)+\alpha_{S L} \cdot P L_{S L}[\mathrm{dBm}] \)
- else
- \( P_{\text {PSSCH }, \text { SL }}(i)=\min \left(P_{\text {CMAX }}, P_{\text {PSSCH }, D}(i)\right)[\mathrm{dBm}] \)
where
- \( P_{0, S L} \) is a value of \( s l-P 0-P S S C H-P S C C H \), if provided
- \( \alpha_{S L} \) is a value of sl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH, if provided; else, \( \alpha_{S L}=1 \)
- \( P L_{S L}= \) referenceSignalPower - higher layer filtered RSRP, where
- referenceSignalPower is obtained from a PSSCH transmit power per RE summed over the antenna ports of the UE, higher layer filtered across PSSCH transmission occasions using a filter configuration provided by sl-FilterCoefficient, and
- higher layer filtered RSRP is a RSRP, as defined in [7, TS 38.215], that is reported to the UE from a UE receiving the PSCCH-PSSCH transmission and is obtained from a PSSCH DM-RS using a filter configuration provided by sl-FilterCoefficient
- \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PSSCH}}(i) \) is a number of resource blocks for PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion \( i \) and \( \mu \) is a SCS configuration

The UE splits the power \( P_{\mathrm{PSSCH}}(i) \) equally across the antenna ports on which the UE transmits the PSSCH with nonzero power.

A UE determines a power \( P_{\mathrm{PSSCH} 2}(i) \) for a PSSCH transmission on a resource pool in the symbols where a corresponding PSCCH is transmitted in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active SL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) as
