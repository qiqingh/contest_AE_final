17.1 RedCap UE procedures

Procedures for a RedCap UE are same as described for a UE in all other clauses of this document unless stated otherwise. In this clause, the term 'UE' refers to a RedCap UE.

A UE expects the initial DL BWP and the active DL BWP after the UE (re)establishes dedicated RRC connection to be smaller than or equal to the maximum DL bandwidth that the UE supports. A UE can be provided a DL BWP by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, and an UL BWP by intitalUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB. If mitialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonSIB indicates an UL BWP that is larger than a maximum UL BWP that a UE supports, the UE expects to be provided an UL BWP by intialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB.

A UE can be provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated a DL BWP, other than the initial DL BWP. A UE can be provided by BWP-UplinkDedicated an UL BWP, other than the initial UL BWP, that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL band width that the UE supports.

If a UE is provided RACH-ConfigCommon-RedCap or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA-RedCap, the UE uses corresponding parameters to perform the procedures in clauses 8.1, 8.1A, and 8.3; otherwise, the UE uses corresponding parameters from RACH-ConfigCommon or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA.

If a UE is provided initialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB and does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE transmits PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.1 using a PUCCH resource set provided by pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap, except that frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission is disabled if disable-FH-PUCCH is provided in PUCCH-ConfigCommonRedCap. If frequency hopping of the PUCCH transmission is disabled then, for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial cyclic shift indexes as \( r_{\mathrm{PUCCH}} \bmod N_{\mathrm{CS}} \) and determines the PRB index as
- \( R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset }}+R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset-add }}+\left\lfloor r_{\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\mathrm{CS}}\right\rfloor \), if BWP-part \( = \) 'FromLowerEdge'
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\mathrm{size}}-R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset }}-R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset-add }}-1-\left\lfloor r_{\mathrm{PUCCH}} / N_{\mathrm{CS}}\right\rfloor \), otherwise
where \( R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\mathrm{offset}-\mathrm{add}} \) is provided by additional- \( R B \)-Offset, if provided; otherwise, \( R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset-add }}=0 \).
For an initial DL BWP provided by initialDownlinkBWP in DownlinkConfigCommonRedCapSIB, if a UE monitors PDCCH according to a Type1-PDCCH CSS set and does not monitor PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE assumes that the initial DL BWP does not include SS/PBCH blocks or the CORESET with index 0 . If the UE monitors PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE assumes that the initial DL BWP
- includes a SS/PBCH block and the CORESET with index 0 if the UE used the SS/PBCH block to obtain SIB1
- includes a SS/PBCH block and does not include the CORESET with index 0 if the initial DL BWP does not include the SS/PBCH block the UE used to obtain SIB1

For an active DL BWP provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated, a UE assumes that the active DL BWP includes a SS/PBCH block, unless the UE indicates a capability to operate in the DL BWP without receiving an SS/PBCH block, and does not include the CORESET with index 0 .
17.2 Half-Duplex UE in paired spectrum

A half-duplex UE (HD-UE) in paired spectrum is not capable of simultaneous transmissions and receptions on a serving cell with paired spectrum. This clause is applicable for communication of a HD-UE on a serving cell with paired spectrum.

A HD-UE does not expect to detect a DCI format scheduling a reception in a set of symbols and detect a DCI format scheduling a transmission in any symbol from the set of symbols.

If a HD-UE is configured by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or PDSCH, or CSI-RS, or DL PRS in a set of symbols, the HD-UE receives the PDCCH, or PDSCH, or CSI-RS, or DL PRS if the HD-UE does not detect a DCI format that indicates to the HD-UE to transmit a PUSCH, or PUCCH, or PRACH, or SRS in at least one symbol of the set of symbols; otherwise, the HD-UE does not receive the PDCCH, or PDSCH, or CSI-RS, or DL PRS in the set of symbols.
