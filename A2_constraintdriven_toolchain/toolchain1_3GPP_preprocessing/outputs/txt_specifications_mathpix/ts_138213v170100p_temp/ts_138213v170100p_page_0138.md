monitoringCapabilityConfig \( =r 17 \) monitoringcapability, and no downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability, the UE does not expect to
- monitor per slot a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells } r 15 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \), and
- monitor per group of \( X_{s} \) slots a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells } r 17 / r 15}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \)

When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability, at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability, and no downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl5monitoringcapability, the UE does not expect to
- monitor per span a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells } r 16 / r 17}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \), and
- monitor per group of \( X_{s} \) slots a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells } r 17 / r 16}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \)

When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than three downlink cells with at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability, at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability, and at least one downlink cell with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r17monitoringcapability, the UE does not expect to
- monitor per slot a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells }, r 15 /\{r 16, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \), and
- monitor per span a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16 /\{r 15, r 17\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \), and
- monitor per group of \( X_{s} \) slots a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17 /\{r 15, r 16\}}^{\text {cap }-r 17} \)

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG and the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability for \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \mathrm{r} 15}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) downlink cells and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for \( N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE expects to be provided pdcch-BlindDetection 3 and pdcch-BlindDetection 2 for the MCG, and pdcchBlindDetection3 and pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG with values that satisfy
- pdcch-BlindDetection3 for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection3 for the SCG <= pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1, if the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1, or
- pdcch-BlindDetection3 for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection3 for the SCG \( <=N_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \mathrm{r} 15}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), if the UE does not report pdcch-BlindDetectionCAI
and
- pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG + pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG <= pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2, if the UE reports pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2, or
- pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the \( \mathrm{MCG}+ \) pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the \( \mathrm{SCG}<=\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC}, \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL}} \), if the UE does not report pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation and is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability for at least one downlink cell and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for at least one downlink cell where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE may indicate, through pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UEI and pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE1, respective maximum values for pdcch-BlindDetection 3 for the MCG and pdcchBlindDetection3 for the SCG, and through pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE2 and pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE2 respective maximum values for pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the MCG and pdcch-BlindDetection2 for the SCG.
