the UE
- appends the HARQ-ACK codebooks for the multicast HARQ-ACK information to the HARQ-ACK codebooks for the unicast HARQ-ACK information
- if \( O_{\mathrm{ACK}}+O_{\mathrm{SR}}+O_{\mathrm{CSI}} \leq 11 \), the UE determines \( n_{\mathrm{HARQ}-\mathrm{ACK}} \) for obtaining a power of a PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information, as described in clause 7.2.1, as a sum of the \( n_{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \) value from clause 9.1.2.1 or clause 9.1.3.3 and the \( n_{\text {HARQ-ACK }} \) value from clause 9.1.3.1.

A UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information as described in clauses 9.2 and 9.2.1 through 9.2.5.

If the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information of same priority associated with unicast DCI formats and with multicast DCI formats in a same PUCCH, the last DCI format that the UE uses to determine the PUCCH resource, as described in clause 9.2.3, is a last unicast DCI format.

If a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH first HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions and second HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast DCI formats and having same priority value as the first HARQ-ACK information, and both the first and second HARQ-ACK information are according to the first HARQACK reporting mode, the UE determines the PUCCH resource based on the last multicast DCI format, as described in clause 9.2.3.

If a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH first HARQ-ACK information associated with unicast SPS PDSCH receptions and second HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast DCI formats and having same priority value as the first HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH, the UE determines the PUCCH resource from SPS-PUCCH-AN-List for unicast SPS PDSCH receptions as described in clause 9.2.1.

If a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH first HARQ-ACK information associated with unicast SPS PDSCH receptions and second HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions and having same priority value as the first HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH, the UE determines the PUCCH resource from SPS-PUCCH-ANList for unicast SPS PDSCH receptions as described in clause 9.2.1.

A UE is not required to multiplex in a PUCCH multicast HARQ-ACK information of a priority and unicast UCI of the priority if the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH for PUCCH transmissions with unicast UCI of the priority.

19 PUSCH transmission in RRC_INACTIVE state
19.1 Configured-grant based PUSCH transmission

A UE indicated to release a dedicated RRC connection can be provided one or more configurations by respective one or more ConfiguredGrantConfig, for configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmissions on the initial UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining of this clause, PUSCH transmissions refer to configured grant Type-1 PUSCH transmissions for a configuration provided by ConfiguredGrantConfig.

A UE can be provided by sdt-SSB-Subset a number of SS/PBCH block indexes \( N_{\mathrm{PUSCH}}^{\mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH}} \) to map to a number of valid PUSCH occasions for PUSCH transmissions over an association period. If the UE is not provided sdt-SSB-Subset, the UE determines \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {SS/PBCH }} \) from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or by ServingCellConfigCommon. A PUSCH occasion for a PUSCH transmission is defined by a time resource and a frequency resource and is associated with a DM-RS provided by cg-DMRS-Configuration for the configuration of PUSCH transmissions.

An association period, starting from frame with SFN 0, for mapping \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {SS/PBCH }} \) SS/PBCH block indexes, from the number of SS/PBCH block indexes, to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources is the smallest value in the set determined by the PUSCH configuration period provided by periodicity in ConfiguredGrantConfig according to Table 19.1-1 such that \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {SS/PBCH }} \) SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources within the association period. A UE is provided a number of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with a PUSCH occasion and a DM-RS resource by sdt-SSB-perCG-PUSCH. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources that are not mapped to \( N_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {SS/PBCH }} \) SS/PBCH block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources.
