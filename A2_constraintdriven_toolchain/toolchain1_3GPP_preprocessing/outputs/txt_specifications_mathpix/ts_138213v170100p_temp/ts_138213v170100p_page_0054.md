A PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap in time and frequency with any valid PRACH occasion associated with either a Type-1 random access procedure or a Type-2 random access procedure. Additionally, for unpaired spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or by ServingCellConfigCommon
- if a UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion
- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and
- starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if channelAccessMode = "semiStatic" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit [15, TS 37.213].
- if a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion
- is within UL symbols, or
- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and
- starts at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last downlink symbol and at least \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where \( N_{\text {gap }} \) is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if channelAccessMode = "semiStatic" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit [15, TS 37.213].
8.2 Random access response - Type-1 random access procedure

In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\mathrm{UE}} \) or \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\text {common }} \), as defined in [4, TS 38.211], is not zero, the window starts after an additional \( T_{\mathrm{TA}}+k_{\text {mac }} \) msec where \( T_{\mathrm{TA}} \) is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and \( k_{\mathrm{mac}} \) is provided by \( K \)-Mac or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K \)-Mac is not provided. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Typel-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by raResponseWindow.

If the UE detects the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers parse the transport block for a random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission. If the higher layers identify the RAPID in RAR message(s) of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an uplink grant to the physical layer. This is referred to as random access response (RAR) UL grant in the physical layer.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \( N_{T, 1}+0.75 \mathrm{msec} \) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \( N_{T, 1} \) is a time duration of \( N_{1} \) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 assuming \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), the corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DMRS is configured, and the corresponding PRACH. For \( \mu=0 \), the UE assumes \( N_{1,0}=14 \) [6, TS 38.214]. For a PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines \( N_{1} \) assuming SCS configuration \( \mu=0 \).

If the UE detects a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), if included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block or a CSI-RS resource
