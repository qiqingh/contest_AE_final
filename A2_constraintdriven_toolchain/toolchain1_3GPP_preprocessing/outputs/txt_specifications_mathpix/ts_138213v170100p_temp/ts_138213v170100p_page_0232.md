If a HD-UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH in a set of symbols and the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the HD-UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols, then
- the HD-UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the HD-UE detects the DCI format; otherwise, the HD-UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS38.214], determined from clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS38.214].
- the HD-UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from the subset of symbols that occur within \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the HD-UE detects the DCI format. The HD-UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
\( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability \( 1[6, \mathrm{TS} 38.214] \) assuming \( d_{2,1}=1 \) and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH.

A HD-UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher layer parameters configuring transmission in a set of symbols and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring reception in the set of symbols. A HD-UE does not expect to receive both a Type-0/0A/1/2-PDCCH CSS set configuration for PDCCH reception in a set of symbols and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring transmission in the set of symbols.

If a HD-UE would transmit a PUSCH, or PUCCH, or SRS based on a configuration by higher layers and the HD-UE is indicated presence of SS/PBCH blocks by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon, the HD-UE does not transmit
- PUSCH or PUCCH if a last symbol of the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission would not be at least \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}[4 \), TS 38.211] prior to a first symbol of the next earliest SS/PBCH block
- PUSCH or PUCCH if a first symbol of the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission would not be at least \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) [4, TS 38.211] after a last symbol of the previous latest SS/PBCH block
- SRS in symbols that would not be at least \( N_{\mathrm{T} x-\mathrm{Rx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) prior to a first symbol of the next earliest SS/PBCH block
- SRS in symbols that would not be at least \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after a last symbol of the previous latest SS/PBCH block

If a HD-UE would transmit a PRACH based on a detected DCI format, or PUSCH, or PUCCH, or SRS and the HD-UE is indicated presence of SS/PBCH blocks by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon in a set of symbols, the HD-UE does not transmit PUSCH or PUCCH or PRACH if a transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols and the HD-UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols.

If a HD-UE would transmit a PRACH or MsgA PUSCH triggered by higher layers in a set of symbols and would receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS, or a DL PRS, or is indicated presence of SS/PBCH blocks by ssbPositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon in symbols that include any symbol from the set of symbols, the HD-UE can select based on its implementation whether to either transmit the PRACH or the MsgA PUSCH or receive the PDSCH , or the \( \mathrm{CSI}-\mathrm{RS} \), or the PL RS , or the PDCCH , or the \( \mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH} \) blocks.

If a HD-UE would receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS, or a DL PRS based on a configuration by higher layers or is indicated presence of SS/PBCH blocks by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon in a set of symbols, and the HD-UE would transmit PRACH or MsgA PUSCH triggered by higher layers starting or ending at a symbol that is earlier or later than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) or \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \), respectively, from the last or first symbol in the set of symbols, the HD-UE can select based on its implementation whether to either transmit the PRACH or the MsgA PUSCH or receive the PDSCH, or the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS, or the PDCCH, or the SS/PBCH blocks.

18 Multicast Broadcast Services
This clause is applicable only for PDCCH receptions, PDSCH receptions, and PUCCH transmissions for MBS on a serving cell. DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI scheduling PDSCH receptions are referred to as multicast DCI formats and the PDSCH receptions are referred to as multicast PDSCH receptions. DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are referred to as broadcast DCI formats and the PDSCH receptions are referred to as broadcast PDSCH receptions.
