- if the overlapping group includes the first PUSCH
- if processingType2Enabled of PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is set to enable for the serving cells with the first PUSCH and the second PUSCHs and if processingType2Enabled of PDSCHServingCellConfig is set to enable for all serving cells where the UE receives the PDSCHs corresponding to the second PUCCHs, \( N_{2} \) is 5 for \( \mu=0,5.5 \) for \( \mu=1 \) and 11 for \( \mu=2 \)
- else, \( N_{2} \) is 10 for \( \mu=0,12 \) for \( \mu=1,23 \) for \( \mu=2,36 \) for \( \mu=3,144 \) for \( \mu=5 \), and 288 for \( \mu=6 \);

If a UE would transmit the following channels, including repetitions if any, that would overlap in time
- a first PUCCH of larger priority index with SR and a second PUCCH or PUSCH of smaller priority index, or
- a configured grant PUSCH of larger priority index and a PUCCH of smaller priority index, or
- a first PUCCH of larger priority index with HARQ-ACK information only in response to PDSCH(s) reception without corresponding PDCCH(s) and a second PUCCH of smaller priority index with HARQACK information only in response to PDSCH(s) reception without corresponding PDCCH(s), or a second PUCCH of smaller priority index with SR and/or CSI, or a configured grant PUSCH with smaller priority index, or a PUSCH of smaller priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH, or
- a PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI reports(s) without a corresponding PDCCH and a PUCCH of smaller priority index with SR, or CSI, or HARQ-ACK information only in response to PDSCH(s) reception without corresponding PDCCH(s), or
- a configured grant PUSCH of larger priority index and a configured grant PUSCH of smaller priority index on a same serving cell
- a PUSCH of smaller priority index scheduled by a DCI format and a configured grant PUSCH of larger priority index on a same serving cell if the UE is provided prioritizationBetweenLP-DG-PUSCHandHP-CGPUSCH
the UE is expected to cancel a repetition of the PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority index before the first symbol overlapping with the PUCCH/PUSCH transmission of larger priority index if the repetition of the PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority index overlaps in time with the PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions of larger priority index. In case of a PUSCH of larger priority index scheduled by a DCI format in a PDCCH reception and a configured grant PUSCH of smaller priority index on a same serving cell and the UE is provided prioritizationBetweenHP-DG-PUSCHandLP-CG-PUSCH
- the UE expects that the transmission of the PUSCH of larger priority index would not start before \( T_{p r o c, 2} \) after a last symbol of the corresponding PDCCH reception
- \( T_{\text {proc, } 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for a corresponding UE processing capability assuming \( d_{2,1}=d_{1}+ d_{3}\left[6\right. \), TS 38.214], based on \( \mu \) and \( N_{2} \) as subsequently defined in this clause, and \( d_{1} \) and \( d_{3} \) are determined by a reported UE capability

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of smaller priority index, including repetitions if any, after resolving the overlapping PUCCH other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and/or PUSCH transmissions, if the PUSCH includes no UCI, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of smaller priority index as described in clauses 9.2.5 and 9.2.6.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of larger priority index only, including repetitions if any, after resolving the overlapping PUCCH other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and/or PUSCH transmissions, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH with SL HARQ-ACK reports
where
- the UE expects that the transmission of the PUSCH would not start before \( T_{p r o c, 2}+d_{1} \) after a last symbol of the corresponding PDCCH reception;
- \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is the PUSCH preparation time for a corresponding UE processing capability assuming \( d_{2,1}=0[6 \), TS 38.214], based on \( \mu \) and \( N_{2} \) as subsequently defined in this clause, and \( d_{1} \) is determined by a reported UE capability.
