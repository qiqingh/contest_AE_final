ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

The UE expects the PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions to fulfill the conditions in clause 9 and clause 9.2 .5 for UCI multiplexing replacing the reference time of "end of PDSCH" with "end of the last symbol of a last PSFCH reception occasion" as described in 16.5 and \( T_{p r o c .1} \) with \( T_{p r e p} \) -

A UE does not expect that a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK reports overlaps with PUSCH with aperiodic or semipersistent CSI reports.

A UE does not expect to be scheduled to transmit a PUCCH or a PUSCH with smaller priority index that would overlap in time with a PUCCH of larger priority index with HARQ-ACK information only in response to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH unless the UE is provided UCI-MuxWithDifferentPriority. A UE does not expect to be scheduled to transmit a PUCCH of smaller priority index that would overlap in time with a PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH unless the UE is provided UCI-
MuxWithDifferentPriority.
In the remaining of this clause, a UE multiplexes UCIs with same priority index in a PUCCH or a PUSCH before considering limitations for UE transmission as described in clause 11.1, clause 11.1.1, and clause 17.2. A PUCCH or a PUSCH is assumed to have a same priority index as a priority index of UCIs a UE multiplexes in the PUCCH or the PUSCH.

In the remaining of this clause, the multiplexing or prioritization for overlapping channels are for overlapping channels with same priority index or for overlapping channels with a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK information.

In the remaining of this clause, if a UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH, a slot for an associated PUCCH resource of a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information includes a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH, unless stated otherwise.

If a UE would transmit on a serving cell a PUSCH without UL-SCH that overlaps with a PUCCH transmission on a serving cell that includes positive SR information, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH.

If a UE would transmit CSI reports on overlapping physical channels, the UE applies the priority rules described in [6, TS 38.214] for the multiplexing of CSI reports.

If a UE has overlapping resources for PUCCH transmissions in a slot and at least one of the PUCCH transmissions is with repetitions over multiple slots, the UE first follows the procedures described in clause 9.2.6 for resolving the overlapping among the resources for the PUCCH transmissions.

If a UE
- would multiplex UCI in a PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a PUSCH transmission, and
- the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions fulfill the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing,
the UE
- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information, if any, from the UCI in the PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE multiplexes aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH;
- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information and CSI reports, if any, from the UCI in the PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE does not multiplex aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH.

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission in one slot with SCS configuration \( \mu_{1} \) UCI of same type that the UE would transmit in PUCCHs in different slots with SCS configuration \( \mu_{2} \) if \( \mu_{1}<\mu_{2} \).

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission or in a PUCCH transmission HARQ-ACK information that the UE would transmit in different PUCCHs of a same priority index.

A UE does not expect a PUCCH resource that results from multiplexing overlapped PUCCH resources, if applicable, to overlap with more than one PUSCHs if each of the more than one PUSCHs includes aperiodic CSI reports.

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or having associated HARQ-ACK information report without scheduling a PDSCH reception, and indicating a resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a slot if the UE previously detects a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission in the slot and if the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.
