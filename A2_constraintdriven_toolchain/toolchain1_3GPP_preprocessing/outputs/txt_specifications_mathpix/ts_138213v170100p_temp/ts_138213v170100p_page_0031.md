- The \( \delta_{\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c} \) values are given in Table 7.1.1-1
- \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(D_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\text {PUSCH, } b_{1}, f_{1} c}(m, l) \) is a sum of TPC command values in a set \( D_{i} \) of TPC command values with cardinality \( C\left(D_{i}\right) \) that the UE receives between \( K_{\text {PUSCH }}\left(i-i_{0}\right)-1 \) symbols before PUSCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( K_{\text {PUSCH }}(i) \) symbols before PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) for PUSCH power control adjustment state \( l \), where \( i_{0}>0 \) is the smallest integer for which \( K_{\text {PUSCH }}\left(i-i_{0}\right) \) symbols before PUSCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) is earlier than \( K_{\text {PUSCH }}(i) \) symbols before PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \)

If the UE transmits a PUSCH associated with the first RS resource index \( q_{d} \), the UE applies the first \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) value, the first \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \) value, and \( f_{b, f, c}(i, l) \) for determining \( P_{\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \). If the UE transmits a PUSCH associated with the second RS resource index \( q_{d} \), the UE applies the second \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE } \_ \text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) value, the second \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \) value, and \( f_{b, f, c}(i, l) \) or \( f_{b, f, c}(i, 0) \) if twoPUSCH-PC-AdjustmentStates is provided or not provided, respectively, for determining \( P_{\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \).
