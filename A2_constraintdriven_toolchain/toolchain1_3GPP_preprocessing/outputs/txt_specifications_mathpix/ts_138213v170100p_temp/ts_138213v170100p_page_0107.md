PDSCH reception provides a transport block for a HARQ process with disabled HARQ-ACK information as indicated by HARQ-feedbackEnabling-disablingperHARQprocess, if provided. The UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits \( O_{\mathrm{ACK}} \) as described in clauses 9.1 through 9.1.5 and a corresponding set of PUCCH resources as described in clause 9.2.1.

A UE does not expect to transmit more than one PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in a slot per priority index, if the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate.

For DCI format 1_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values map to \( \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} \) for SCS configuration of PUCCH transmission \( \mu \leq 3 \), to \( \{7,8,12,16,20,24,28,32\} \) for \( \mu=5 \), and to \( \{13,16,24,32,40 \), 48, 56, 64\} for \( \mu=6 \). For a unicast DCI format, other than DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) or requesting Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report without scheduling a PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.1.4, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values, if present, map to values for a set of number of slots provided by \( d l \)-DataToUL-ACK, \( d l \) -DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17 as defined in Table 9.2.3-1. If the DCI format indicates a cell for the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 9-A, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field value maps to slots of the active UL BWP of the cell; otherwise, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field value maps to slots of the active UL BWP of the PCell. For DCI format 4_1, the PDSCH-toHARQ_feedback timing indicator field values are provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_l or, if dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_ 1 is not provided, by \( \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} \). For DCI format \( 4 \_2 \), the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values are provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK from pucchConfigurationListMulticast I or pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast2.

If the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH, \( n \) is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a PDSCH reception or with a PDCCH reception providing a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception; otherwise, \( n \) is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with the DL slot \( n_{D} \) for the PDSCH reception or with the DL slot \( n_{D} \) for the PDCCH reception in case of a DCI format that triggers a HARQ-ACK information report and does not schedule a PDSCH reception.

For a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot \( n_{D} \), the UE transmits the PUCCH in UL slot \( n+k \) where \( n \) is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with slot \( n_{D} \) and \( k \) is provided by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format activating the SPS PDSCH reception.

If the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field and schedules a PDSCH reception or activates a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot \( n_{D} \), the UE provides corresponding HARQACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot \( n+k \) where \( n \) is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with slot \( n_{D} \) and \( k \) is provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-rl6, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1.

If the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a number of PDSCH receptions ending in DL slot \( n_{D} \) or if the UE detects a DCI format generating a HARQ-ACK information bit and does not schedule a PDSCH reception through a PDCCH reception ending in DL slot \( n_{D} \), the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot \( n+k \), where \( n \) is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with slot \( n_{D} \) and \( k \) is a number of slots and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format, if present, or provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4_1.

A PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.
