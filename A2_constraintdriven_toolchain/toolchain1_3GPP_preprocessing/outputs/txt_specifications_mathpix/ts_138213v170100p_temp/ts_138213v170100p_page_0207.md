- when it is not indicated as available by resourceAvailability
- when the [AB-MT is operating on an associated carrier, if that indication is provided
- when the current [AB-DU transmission mode corresponds to an associated multiplexing mode, if that indication is provided
- when one of the associated TCI states, RS resource indexes, or SRI of the [AB-MT, if provided, is simultaneously used for reception or transmission of the [AB-MT
- when simultaneous transmission/reception by the [AB-MT and transmission from the [AB-DU cell occur in nonoverlapping frequency resources, if such indication is provided, or when simultaneous transmission/reception by the [AB-MT and transmission from the [AB-DU cell occur in overlapping frequency resources
- in a given slot, if that indication is provided

For a serving cell of an [AB-MT, the [AB-MT can be provided a set of TCI states or a set of RS resource indexes corresponding to a SS/PBCH block or to a CSI-RS resource index for a slot where a PDSCH EPRE adjustment is indicated by DL Tx Power Adjustment MAC CE as described in [11, TS 38.321]. The PDSCH EPRE can be derived from a downlink CSI-RS EPRE as described in [6, TS 38.214] and a PDSCH power offset provided by powerControlOffsetIAB as described in [11, TS 38.321]. For a downlink DM-RS and/or PT-RS associated with a PDSCH, the [AB-MT may assume that the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE, and/or PT-RS EPRE to PDSCH EPRE, is obtained as for a "UE" in [6, TS 38.214]. [f no TCI state or RS resource index is provided to the [AB-MT, the [AB-MT may assume that a same PDSCH EPRE adjustment applies to all TCI states or RS resource indexes configured for the [AB-MT. A PDSCH EPRE adjustment provided by DL Tx Power Adjustment MAC CE may be restricted to frequency resources of an [AB-node that do not result in simultaneous reception on the same frequency resources by an [AB-MT and [AB-DU in a slot.

15 Dual active protocol stack based handover
If a UE indicates a capability for dual active protocol stack based handover (DAPS HO), the UE can be provided with a source MCG and a target MCG.

If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2 and with a source MCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively, the UE performs transmission power control independently per cell group as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 .

If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 and a source MCG using NR radio access in FR1, the UE is configured a maximum power \( P_{\text {MCG }} \) for transmissions on the target MCG by \( p \)-DAPS-Target and a maximum power \( P_{S C G} \) for transmissions on the source MCG by \( p \)-DAPS-Source and with an inter-CG power sharing mode by uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode. The UE determines a transmission power on the target MCG and a transmission power on the source MCG per frequency range.

If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing model and is provided uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode \( = \) Semi-static-model, the UE determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source MCG as described in clause 7.6 .2 for nrdc-PCmode-FRI = Semi-static-model by considering the target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG.

If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing mode2 and is provided uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode \( = \) Semi-static-mode2, the UE determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source SCG as described in clause 7.62 for nrdc-PCmode-FRI = Semi-static-mode 2 by considering the target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG. The UE expects to be provided uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode \( = \) Semi-static-mode 2 only for synchronous DAPS HO operation [10, TS 38.133].

If the UE indicates support for dynamic power sharing and is provided uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode \( = \) Dynamic, the UE determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source MCG as described in clause 7.6 .2 for nrdc-PCmode-FRI = Dynamic by considering the target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG.

Intra-frequency DAPS handover is described in clause 6.1.3.2 of [10, TS38.133].
For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if
