from the \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, X_{S}, \mu} \) downlink cells where \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, j} \) is a number of configured cells with associated PDCCH candidates monitored in the active DL BWPs of the scheduling cells using SCS configuration \( j \). If the UE is configured \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}} \) downlink cells for which the UE is provided both monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability or monitoringCapabilityConfig = r16monitoringcapability, and monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability for the active DL BWP, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17 / \mathrm{r} 15}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), or by \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17 / \mathrm{r} 16}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), or by \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17 /\{\mathrm{r} 15, \mathrm{r} 16\}}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), respectively, and \( \left.N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, X_{s}, \mu} / \sum_{j=0}^{6} N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, j}\right\rfloor \), and \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{ref}}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is one of \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17 / \mathrm{r} 15}^{\text {cap-r17 }}, N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r} 17 / \mathrm{r} 16}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), or \( N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r} 17 /\{\mathrm{r} 15, \mathrm{r} 16\}}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), respectively.

For each scheduled cell from the \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL} X_{s}, \mu} \) downlink cells using any combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \) for a group of \( X_{s} \) slots, the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \) of the scheduling cell, more than \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{S}, \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, X_{S}, \mu}\right) \) PDCCH candidates or more than \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{S}, \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, X_{S}, \mu}\right) \) non-overlapped CCEs per group of \( X_{s} \) slots.

For cross-carrier scheduling, the number of PDCCH candidates for monitoring and the number of non-overlapped CCEs per span or per slot or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots are separately counted for each scheduled cell.

The UE allocates PDCCH candidates for monitoring to USS sets for the primary cell having an active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \) in a slot if the UE is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig for the primary cell or if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability for the primary cell, or in the first span of each slot if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for the primary cell, or in a group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \) if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl 7 monitoringcapability for the primary cell, according to the following pseudocode.

If for the USS sets for scheduling on the primary cell the UE is not provided coresetPoollndex for first CORESETs, or is provided coresetPoollndex with value 0 for first CORESETs, and is provided coresetPoollndex with value 1 for second CORESETs, and if \( \min \left(\gamma \cdot M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu}\right)>\min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \) or \( \min (\gamma \cdot \left.C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, slot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu}\right)>\min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s \text { lot, } \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot, } \mu}\right) \), the following pseudocode applies only to USS sets associated with the first CORESETs. A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH in a USS set without allocated PDCCH candidates for monitoring.

In the following pseudocode, if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for the primary cell, \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s \text { lot, } \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } s \text { lot, } \mu} \) are replaced by \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max _{1}(X, Y) \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max (X, Y), \mu} \) respectively, and \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot }, \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot. } \mu} \) are replaced by \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, }(X, Y) \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, }(X, Y) \mu} \) respectively.

In the following pseudocode, if the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r17monitoringcapability for the primary cell, \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , \text { slot }, \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , \text { slot }, \mu} \) are replaced by \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{\mathrm{S}, \mu} \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{\mathrm{S}, \mu} \mu} \) respectively, and \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, } \text { slot }, \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, slot } \mu} \) are replaced by \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, } X_{s}, \mu} \) and \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, } X_{s}, \mu} \) respectively.

For all search space sets that a UE monitors PDCCH on the primary cell within a slot \( n \), or within a group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \), or within a span in slot \( n \), denote by \( S_{\text {css }} \) a set of CSS sets, except for CSS sets provided by searchSpaceBroadcast or by searchSpace-Multicast, with cardinality of \( I_{\mathrm{css}} \) and by \( S_{\mathrm{uss}} \) a set of USS sets and CSS sets provided by searchSpaceBroadcast or by searchSpace-Multicast with cardinality of \( J_{\text {uss }} \) for scheduling on the primary cell. The location of search space sets \( s_{j}, 0 \leq j<J_{u s s} \), in \( S_{\text {uss }} \) is according to an ascending order of the search space set index.

Denote by \( M_{S_{\mathrm{css}}(i)}^{(L)}, 0 \leq i<I_{c S S} \), the number of counted PDCCH candidates for monitoring for CSS set \( S_{\mathrm{css}}(i) \) and by \( M_{S_{\mathrm{uss}}(j)}^{(L)}, 0 \leq j<J_{u s s} \), the number of counted PDCCH candidates for monitoring for search space set \( S_{\mathrm{uss}}(j) \). If a UE indicates three-BDforSSsetLinking and is provided for search space set \( s_{j} \), by searchSpaceLinking, a search space set \( s_{i} \) with \( s_{i}<s_{j} \), set \( M_{S_{\mathrm{css}}(j)}^{(L)}=2 \cdot M_{S_{\mathrm{css}}(j)}^{(L)} \) if \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) are CSS sets or set \( M_{S_{\mathrm{uss}}(j)}^{(L)}=2 \cdot M_{S_{\mathrm{uss}}(j)}^{(L)} \) if \( s_{i} \) and \( s_{j} \) are USS sets.

For the CSS sets in \( S_{\mathrm{css}} \), a UE monitors \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{css}}=\sum_{i=0}^{I_{\mathrm{css}}-1} \sum_{L} M_{S_{\mathrm{css}}(i)}^{(L)} \) PDCCH candidates requiring a total of \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{css}} \) non-overlapping CCEs in a slot, of in group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination ( \( X_{s}, Y_{s} \) ), or in a span.

Denote by \( V_{\text {CCE }}\left(S_{\text {uss }}(j)\right) \) the set of non-overlapping CCEs for search space set \( S_{\text {uss }}(j) \) and by \( C\left(V_{\text {CCE }}\left(S_{\text {uss }}(j)\right)\right) \); the cardinality of \( V_{\text {CCE }}\left(S_{\text {uss }}(j)\right) \) where a UE determines the non-overlapping CCEs for search space set \( S_{\text {uss }}(j) \) considering the allocated PDCCH candidates for monitoring for the CSS sets in \( S_{\mathrm{css}} \) and the allocated PDCCH candidates for monitoring for all search space sets \( S_{\text {uss }}(k), 0 \leq k \leq j \).
