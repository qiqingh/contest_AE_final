- sdt-CG-SearchSpace for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI as described in clause 19.1.

In the following, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI are also referred to as unicast DCI formats, DCI formats with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI are also referred to as multicast DCI formats, and DCI formats with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or G-RNTI for MTCH scheduling PDSCH receptions are also referred to as broadcast DCI formats.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceSIB1 for Type0-PDCCH CSS set by PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1.

If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0 , or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active DL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has search space set index 0 .

If the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by cfr-Config-MCCH-MTCH for a UE have same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency resource, and if the UE is provided searchSpaceBroadcast for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for Type3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the active DL BWP.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided ra-SearchSpace for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, or a Type1APDCCH CSS set, or a USS set and the UE has received a C-RNTI and has been provided a Typel-PDCCH CSS set, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI in the Type1-PDCCH CSS set.

If a UE is not provided pagingSearchSpace for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.

If a UE is not provided peiSearchSpace for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2APDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1. If the UE is provided peiSearchSpace with zero value for the Type2A-PDCCH CSS set index, and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13.

If a UE is provided a zero value for searchSpaceID in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or is not provided searchSpaceBroadcast, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 13, and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE monitors PDCCH
