- If the PUCCH transmission is not in response to a detection by the UE of a DCI format, \( K_{\mathrm{PUCCH}}(i) \) is a number of \( K_{\mathrm{PUCCH} \text { min }} \) symbols equal to the product of a number of symbols per slot, \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \), and the minimum of the values provided by \( k 2 \) in PUSCH-ConfigCommon for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \)
- If the UE has reached maximum power for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) at PUCCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(c_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\mathrm{PUCCH}_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}(m, l) \geq 0 \), then \( g_{b_{1}, f, c}(i, l)=g_{b_{1}, f, c}\left(i-i_{0}, l\right) \)
- If UE has reached minimum power for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) at PUCCH transmission occasion \( i-i_{0} \) and \( \sum_{m=0}^{\ell\left(C_{i}\right)-1} \delta_{\text {PUCCH }_{1} b_{1}, c, c}(m, l) \leq 0 \), then \( g_{b_{1}, f, c}(i, l)=g_{b_{1}, f, c}\left(i-i_{0}, l\right) \)
- If a configuration of a \( P_{0 \_\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c}\left(q_{u}\right) \) value for a corresponding PUCCH power control adjustment state \( l \) for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \) is provided by higher layers,
- \( \quad g_{b, f, c}(k, l)=0, \quad k=0,1, \ldots, i \)
- if the UE is provided PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, the UE determines the value of \( l \) from the value of \( q_{u} \) based on a pucch-SpatialRelationInfold value associated with the p0-PUCCH-Id value corresponding to \( q_{u} \) and with the closedLoopIndex value corresponding to \( l \);
- else, if the UE is provided more than one sets of power control parameters for operation in FR1, and if the UE receives an activation command for a PUCCH resource that indicates one or two sets of the more than one sets of power control parameters, the UE determines the value of \( l \) based on the closedLoopIndex value in the one or two sets of power control parameters;
- else, \( l=0 \)
- Else,
- \( \quad g_{b_{1} f_{1} c}(0, l)=\Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b_{1}, c, c}+\delta_{b_{1}, f, c} \), where \( l=0 \), and \( \delta_{b_{1} f_{1} c} \) is
- the TPC command value indicated in a random access response grant corresponding to a PRACH transmission according to Type-1 random access procedure, or in a random access response grant corresponding to MsgA transmissions according to Type-2 random access procedure with RAR message(s) for fallbackRAR, or
- the TPC command value indicated in a successRAR corresponding to MsgA transmissions for Type-2 random access procedure, or
- the TPC command value in a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI that the UE detects in a first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld if the PUCCH transmission is a first PUCCH transmission after 28 symbols from a last symbol of the first PDCCH reception,
and, if the UE transmits PUCCH on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \),
\( \Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b_{1} f_{1} c}=\min \left[\max \left(0, P_{\text {CMAX }_{1} f_{1} c}-\left(P_{0_{-} \text {PUCCH }_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}+P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right)+\Delta_{\text {F_PUCCH }_{-}}+\Delta_{T F_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}+\right.\right.\right. \left.\left.\left.\delta_{b_{1}, f_{1} c}\right)\right), \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested }, b_{1}, c, c}\right] ; \)
otherwise,
\( \Delta P_{\text {rampup } b_{1} f_{1} c}=\min \left[\max \left(0, P_{\text {CMAX }_{1} f_{1} c}-\left(P_{0_{-} \text {PUCCH }_{1} b_{1} f_{1} c}+P L_{b_{1} f_{1} c}\left(q_{d}\right)\right)\right), \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested } b_{1} f_{1} c}\right] \)
where \( \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested, } b_{1} f, c} \) is provided by higher layers and corresponds to the total power ramp-up requested by higher layers from the first to the last preamble for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of primary cell \( c \), and \( \Delta_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{PCCH}} \) corresponds to PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1
