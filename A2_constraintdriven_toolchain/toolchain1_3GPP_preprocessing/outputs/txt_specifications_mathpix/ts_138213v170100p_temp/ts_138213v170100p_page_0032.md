- If the UE receives a random access response message in response to a PRACH transmission or a MsgA transmission on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) as described in clause 8
- \( f_{b_{1}, f_{1} c}(0, l)=\Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b, f, c}+\delta_{\text {msg } 2, b, f, c} \), where \( l=0 \) and
- \( \delta_{\text {msg2, } b_{1}, c} \) is a TPC command value indicated in a random access response grant of the random access response message corresponding to a PRACH transmission according to Type-1 random access procedure, or in a random access response grant of the random access response message corresponding to a MsgA transmission according to Type-2 random access procedure with RAR message(s) for fallbackRAR, on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), and
\[
-\Delta P_{\text {rampup, } b, f, c}=\min \left[\left\{\max \left(0, P_{\text {CMAX, }, c}-\left(\begin{array}{c}
10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\text {RB }, f, f, c}^{\text {PUSCH }}(0)\right) \\
+P_{\mathrm{O}_{-} \text {PUSCH, }, b, c}(0)+\alpha_{b, f, c}(0) \cdot P L_{c} \\
+\Delta_{\text {TF, } b, f, c}(0)+\delta_{\text {msg } 2, b, f, c}
\end{array}\right)\right)\right\}, \quad \Delta P_{\text {rampupreguessed }, b, f, c}\right]
\]
and \( \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested }, b_{1}, c, c} \) is provided by higher layers and corresponds to the total power ramp-up requested by higher layers from the first to the last random access preamble for carrier \( f \) in the serving cell \( c, M_{\mathrm{RB}, b_{1}, f_{1} c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(0) \) is the bandwidth of the PUSCH resource assignment expressed in number of resource blocks for the first PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), and \( \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f_{1} c}(0) \) is the power adjustment of first PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \).
- If the UE transmits the PUSCH in PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) as described in clause 8.1A, \( f_{b, f, c}(0, l)=\Delta P_{\text {rampup }, b, f, c} \), where
- \( l=0 \), and
and \( \Delta P_{\text {rampup_requested, } b_{1}, c} \) is provided by higher layers and corresponds to the total power ramp-up requested by higher layers, \( M_{\mathrm{RB}, b, f, c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(i) \) is the band width of the PUSCH resource assignment expressed in number of resource blocks, and \( \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b, f, c}(i) \) is the power adjustment of the PUSCH transmission in PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \).

7.2 Physical uplink control channel

If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both MCG and SCG.
- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the MCG.
- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the SCG. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both primary PUCCH group and secondary PUCCH group.
