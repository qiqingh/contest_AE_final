candidates only at monitoring occasions associated with a SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block is determined by the most recent of
- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that includes a CORESET with index 0 , as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block, or
- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure

If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a nonzero value for searchSpacelD in PDCCH-ConfigCommon for a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for searchSpaceBroadcast in pdcch-Config-MCCH and pdcch-Config-MTCH for a Type0/0B-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or of the Type0/0B-PDCCH set, respectively, based on the search space set associated with the value of searchSpaceID.

The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions in the CORESET configured by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB, the DM-RS antenna port associated with corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, a SCS is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and for operation in FR2-2, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.

For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a PDCCH in a Typel-PDCCH CSS set is not configured with same qcl-Type set to 'typeD' properties [6, TS 38.214] with a DM-RS for monitoring the PDCCH in the Type0/0A/0B/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in the USS set, and if the PDCCH or an associated PDSCH overlaps in at least one symbol with a PDCCH the UE monitors in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with an associated PDSCH.

If a UE is provided
- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, and
- a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI
the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI, the MCS-C-RNTI, or the CS-RNTI in the one or more search space sets in a slot where the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for at least a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MsgBRNTI, or P-RNTI.

If a UE is provided
- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, pagingSearchSpace, peiSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, or a CSS set by PDCCH-Config, and
- a SI-RNTI, a P-RNTI, a PEI-RNTI, a RA-RNTI, a MsgB-RNTI, a SFI-RNTI, an INT-RNTI, a TPC-PUSCHRNTI, a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, or a TPC-SRS-RNTI
then, for a RNTI from any of these RNTIs, the UE does not expect to process information from more than one DCI format with CRC scrambled with the RNTI per slot.
