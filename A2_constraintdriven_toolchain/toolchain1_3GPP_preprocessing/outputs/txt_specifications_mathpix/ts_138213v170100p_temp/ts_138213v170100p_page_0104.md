For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that two hops of a PUCCH transmission are in different RB sets.

The UE expects that uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon and uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWPUplinkDedicated are provided either in all UL BWPs or in none of the UL BWPs for a serving cell.

If a UE is provided useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated, the UE determines available RBs for PUCCH transmissions within the active UL BWP as the intersection of RBs corresponding to an interlace index provided by interlace0 and, if provided, interlacel, and RBs of an RB set provided by rb-SetIndex. The intersection results in \( M_{\text {interlace }, 0}^{\text {PUCCH }} \) RBs in the first interlace and the UE expects that \( M_{\text {interlace }, 0}^{\text {PUCCH }} \) is either 10 or 11 . If interlacel is provided, the intersection results in \( M_{\text {interlace, } 1}^{\text {PUCCH }} \) RBs in the second interlace and the UE expects that \( M_{\text {interlace, } 1}^{\text {PUCCH }} \) is either 10 or 11.

If the format indicates PUCCH-format0, the PUCCH format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 0 , where the PUCCH resource also includes an index for an initial cyclic shift provided by initialCyclicShift, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by nrofSymbols, a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by startingSymbollndex. For PUCCH transmission in FR2-2, the PUCCH resource can also include a number of PRBs \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 0} \) provided by nrofPRBs; otherwise, \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 0}=1 \).

If the format indicates PUCCH-formatl, the PUCCH format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 1, where the PUCCH resource also includes an index for an initial cyclic shift provided by initialCyclicShift, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by nrofSymbols, a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by startingSymbollndex, and an index for an orthogonal cover code by timeDomainOCC. For PUCCH transmission in FR2-2, the PUCCH resource can also include a number of PRBs \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 1} \) provided by nrofPRBs; otherwise, \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 1}=1 \).

If the format indicates PUCCH-format2 or PUCCH-format3, the PUCCH format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3, respectively, where the PUCCH resource also includes a number of PRBs provided by nrofPRBs, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by nrofSymbols, and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by startingSymbollndex. If a UE is provided by uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated, and the format indicates PUCCH-format2 or PUCCH-format3 and PUCCH-ResourceExt is provided, the PUCCH resource also includes an index of a second interlace by interlacel, if provided; otherwise, if interlacel is not provided, the PUCCH resource also includes, if provided, an orthogonal cover code length by occLength and an orthogonal cover code index by occ-Index. If the format indicates PUCCH-format 3 and PUCCHResourceExt is provided, the UE assumes that the \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {PUCCH,3 }} \) [4, TS38.211] PRBs with the lowest indexes within the first, and if configured, second interlace are used for PUCCH transmission.

If the format indicates PUCCH-format4, the PUCCH format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 4, where the PUCCH resource also includes a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by noffymbols, an orthogonal cover code length by occ-Length, an orthogonal cover code index by occ-Index, and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by startingSymbollndex. For PUCCH transmission in FR2-2, the PUCCH resource can also include a number of \( \mathrm{PRBs} M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 4} \) provided by nrofPRBs; otherwise, \( M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}, 4}=1 \).

If a UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH in a PUCCH-Config, the first symbol of a PUCCH resource provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet or SPS-PUCCH-AN-List in PUCCH-Config or by \( n I P U C C H \)-AN in SPS-Config for multiplexing HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH transmission is relative to the first symbol of the subslotLengthForPUCCH symbols [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining cases, the first symbol of a PUCCH resource is relative to the first symbol of a slot with \( N_{\text {sym }}^{\text {slot }} \) symbols [4, TS 38.211].

A UE can be configured up to four sets of PUCCH resources in a PUCCH-Config. A PUCCH resource set is provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet and is associated with a PUCCH resource set index provided by pucch-ResourceSetld, with a set of PUCCH resource indexes provided by resourceList that provides a set of pucch-Resourceld used in the PUCCH resource set, and with a maximum number of UCI information bits the UE can transmit using a PUCCH resource in the PUCCH resource set provided by maxPayloadSize. For the first PUCCH resource set, the maximum number of UCI information bits is 2 . A maximum number of PUCCH resource indexes for a set of PUCCH resources is provided by maxNrofPUCCH-ResourcesPerSet. The maximum number of PUCCH resources in the first PUCCH resource set is 32 and the maximum number of PUCCH resources in the other PUCCH resource sets is 8 .

If the UE transmits \( O_{\mathrm{UCl}} \mathrm{UCI} \) information bits, that include HARQ-ACK information bits, the UE determines a PUCCH resource set to be
