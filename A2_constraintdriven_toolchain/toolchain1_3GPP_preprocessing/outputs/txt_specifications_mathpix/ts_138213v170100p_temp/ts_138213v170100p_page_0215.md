16.2.4.2 Simultaneous PSFCH transmission/reception

For a PSFCH transmission or reception with HARQ-ACK information, a priority value for the PSFCH is equal to the priority value indicated by an SCI format 1-A associated with the PSFCH.

For PSFCH transmission with conflict information, a priority value for the PSFCH is equal to the smallest priority value determined by the corresponding SCI formats \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) for the conflicting resources.

For PSFCH reception with conflict information, a priority value for the PSFCH is equal to the priority value determined by the corresponding SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) for the conflicting resource.

If a UE
- would transmit \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs and receive \( N_{\text {sch, Rx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs, and
- transmissions of the \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs would overlap in time with receptions of the \( N_{\text {sch, Rx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs
the UE transmits or receives only a set of PSFCHs corresponding to the smallest priority field value, as determined by a first set of SCI format 1-A and/or a second set of SCI format 1-A [5, TS 38.212] that are respectively associated with PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information from the \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs and PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information from the \( N_{\text {sch, } \mathrm{Rx}_{1} \text { PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs when one or more of the PSFCHs provide HARQ-ACK information. If none of the \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs and none of the \( N_{\text {sch, Rx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs provide HARQ-ACK information, the UE transmits or receives only a set of PSFCHs corresponding to the smallest priority value of the first set of PSFCHs and the second set of PSFCHs that are respectively associated with the \( N_{\text {sch, Tx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs and the \( N_{\text {sch, Rx, PSFCH }} \) PSFCHs when the PSFCHs provide conflict information...
