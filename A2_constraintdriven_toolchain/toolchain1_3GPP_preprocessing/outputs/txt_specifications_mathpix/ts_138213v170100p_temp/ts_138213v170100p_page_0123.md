If a UE transmits a PUCCH that includes HARQ-ACK information bits of priority 0 and 1 using a PUCCH resource that includes PUCCH format 2, 3 or 4, the UE determines a power for the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 7.2.1, assuming that the PUCCH includes only UCI bits of priority 1 , where \( N_{\mathrm{RE}}(i)=\min \left(M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sc}, \mathrm{crt} \mid}^{\mathrm{RB}}\right. \). \( \left.N_{\text {symb-UCl },}^{\text {PUCCH }},\left[\left(O_{\mathrm{UCl}_{1}, 1}+O_{\mathrm{CRC}_{1} 1}\right) /\left(Q_{m} \cdot r_{1}\right)\right]\right) \).
9.2.5.4 UE procedure for deferring HARQ-ACK for SPS PDSCH

If a UE is provided spsHARQdeferral and, after performing the procedures in clauses 9 and 9.2 .5 to resolve overlapping among PUCCHs and PUSCHs in a first slot, if any, the UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with first HARQ-ACK information bits for SPS PDSCH receptions that the UE would report for a first time, and the PUCCH resource
- is provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List as described in clause 9.2.1, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided
- is not cancelled by an overlapping PUCCH or PUSCH transmission of larger priority index
- overlaps with a symbol indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DLConfigDedicated, or indicated for a SS/PBCH block by ssb-PositionsInBurst, or belonging to a CORESET associated with a Type0-PDCCH CSS set
the UE
- determines an earliest second slot and, after performing the procedures in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 to resolve overlapping among PUCCHs and PUSCHs, if any, a PUSCH or a PUCCH in the earliest second slot to multiplex HARQ-ACK information bits that include second HARQ-ACK information bits from the first HARQ-ACK information bits
- if the UE detects a DCI format in a PDCCH reception that triggers a PUCCH transmission with a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook in a slot as described in clause 9.1 .4 , the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot
- if the UE is provided a periodic cell switching pattern for PUCCH transmissions by pucch-sSCellPattern, the UE determines the earliest second slot and a corresponding cell based on the periodic cell switching pattern as described in clause 9.A
- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH, or in a PUCCH using a resource that is not from SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or from nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot
- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH using a resource provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, of smaller priority index and the UE drops the first PUCCH transmission due to an overlapping with a second PUSCH or PUCCH transmission of larger priority index, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot
- the second HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to SPS PDSCH configurations with spsHARQdeferral values that are larger than or equal to a time difference, with reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions on the primary cell, between the second slot and the slot of the SPS PDSCH reception, if any
- if the UE multiplexes the second HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH using a resource provided by SPS-PUCCH-AN-List, or by nIPUCCH-AN if SPS-PUCCH-AN-List is not provided, and the PUCCH transmission is not dropped due to an overlapping with a PUSCH or PUCCH transmission of larger priority and does not have any symbol that overlaps with a symbol indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated, or indicated for a SS/PBCH block by ssbPositionsInBurst, or belonging to a CORESET associated with a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE stops the procedure to determine the earliest second slot in the slot
- the second HARQ-ACK information bits, generated as described in clause 9.1 2, are appended in a HARQ-ACK codebook the UE generates as described in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.2.1,9.1.3.1, or 9.1.5
- if the UE would receive a PDSCH providing a TB for a same HARQ process as a HARQ-ACK information bit from the second HARQ-ACK information bits prior to transmitting the PUCCH or the PUSCH, the UE does not include the HARQ-ACK information bit in the HARQ-ACK information bits.
