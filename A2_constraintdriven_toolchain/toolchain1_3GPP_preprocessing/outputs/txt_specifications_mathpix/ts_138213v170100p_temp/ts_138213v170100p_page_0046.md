ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- provides the Type 1 power headroom report if both the Type 1 and Type 3 power headroom reports are based on respective actual transmissions or on respective reference transmissions
- provides the power headroom report that is based on a respective actual transmission if either the Type 1 report or the Type 3 report is based on a respective reference transmission

If a UE is configured with a SCG and if \( p h r-M o d e O t h e r C G \) for a CG indicates 'virtual' then, for power headroom reports transmitted on the CG, the UE computes \( P H \) assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the other CG. For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes \( P H \) assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively.

If the UE is configured with a SCG,
- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to MCG, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the MCG.
- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to SCG, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the SCG. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell,
- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to primary PUCCH group, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the primary PUCCH group.
- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to secondary PUCCH group, the term 'serving cell' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the secondary PUCCH group. The term 'primary cell' in this clause refers to the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group.

For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered and,
- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is different from that of E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR, the UE provides power headroom of the first NR slot that fully overlaps with the E-UTRA subframe;
- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is the same as that of E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR for asynchronous EN-DC/NE-DC [10, TS 38.133], the UE provides power headroom of the first NR slot that overlaps with the E-UTRA subframe.
7.7.1 Type 1 PH report

If a UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated serving cell is based on an actual PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH transmission occasion \( i \) on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), the UE computes the Type 1 power headroom report as
\[
\begin{array}{c}
P H_{\text {lypel }, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right)=P_{\text {CMAX }, f, c}(i)-\left\{P_{\text {o_PUSCH }_{1}, f, c}(j)+10 \log _{10}\left(2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\text {RB }, b, f, c}^{\text {PUSCH }}(i)\right)+\alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \cdot P L_{b, f, c}\left(q_{d}\right)+\Delta_{\text {TF }, b, f, c}(i)+f_{b, f, c}(i, l)\right\} \\
{[\mathrm{dB}]}
\end{array}
\]
where \( P_{\mathrm{CMAX}_{1} f_{1} c}(i), P_{0_{-} \mathrm{PUSCH}, b_{1} f, c}(j), M_{\mathrm{RB}, b_{1} f, c}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}(i), \alpha_{b_{1} f, c}(j), P L_{b_{1} f, c}\left(q_{d}\right), \Delta_{\mathrm{TF}, b_{1} f, c}(i) \) and \( f_{b_{1} f, c}(i, l) \) are defined in clause 7.1.1.

If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, where a SCS configuration \( \mu_{1} \) on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) of carrier \( f_{1} \) of serving cell \( c_{1} \) is smaller than a SCS configuration \( \mu_{2} \) on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) of carrier \( f_{2} \) of serving cell \( c_{2} \), and if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission in a slot on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) that overlaps with multiple slots on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \), the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the first slot of the multiple slots on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) that fully overlaps with the slot on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) - If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, where a same SCS configuration on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \) of carrier \( f_{1} \) of serving cell \( c_{1} \) and active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) of carrier \( f_{2} \) of serving cell \( c_{2} \), and if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission in a slot on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \), the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the slot on active UL BWP \( b_{2} \) that overlaps with the slot on active UL BWP \( b_{1} \).
