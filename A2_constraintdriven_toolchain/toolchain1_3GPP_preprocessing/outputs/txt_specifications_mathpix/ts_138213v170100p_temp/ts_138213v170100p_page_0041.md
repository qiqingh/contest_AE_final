7.4 Physical random access channel

A UE determines a transmission power for a physical random access channel (PRACH), \( P_{\text {PRACH }, b, f, c}(i) \), on active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( C \) based on DL RS for serving cell \( C \) in transmission occasion \( i \) as
\[
P_{\text {PRACHh }, f, c}(i)=\min \left\{P_{\text {CMAX } f, c}(i), P_{\text {PRACHarget } f, c}+P L_{b, f c}\right\}[\mathrm{dBm}]
\]
where \( P_{\text {CMAX, } f c}(i) \) is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], [8-2, TS 38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( \mathcal{C} \) within transmission occasion \( i, P_{\text {PRACH, largel, } 46} \) is the PRACH target reception power PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for the active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( C \), and \( P L_{b, f, c} \) is a pathloss for the active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) based on the DL RS associated with the PRACH transmission on the active DL BWP of serving cell \( C \) and calculated by the UE in dB as referenceSignalPower - higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm , where RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] and the higher layer filter configuration is defined in [12, TS 38.331]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE determines \( P L_{b, f, c} \) based on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission.

If a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \( q_{\text {new }} \) is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower.

If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasicollocated with as described in clause 10.1, referenceSignalPower is provided by ss-PBCH-BlockPower or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index \( q_{\text {new }} \) is associated with a periodic CSI-RS configuration as described in clause 6, referenceSignalPower is obtained by ss-PBCH-BlockPower and powerControlOffsetSS where powerControlOffsetSS provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If powerControlOffsetSS is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB . If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' and the UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by power ControlOffsetSS.

If within a random access response window, as described in clause 8.2, the UE does not receive a random access response that contains a preamble identifier corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted by the UE, the UE determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH transmission, if any, as described in [11, TS 38.321].

If prior to a PRACH retransmission, a UE changes the spatial domain transmission filter, Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the power ramping counter as described in [11, TS 38.321].

If due to power allocation to PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH/SRS transmissions as described in clause 7.5 , or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or NR-DC operation, or due to slot format determination as described in clause 11.1, or due to the PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH/SRS transmission occasions are in the same slot or the gap between a PRACH transmission and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission is small as described in clause 8.1, the UE does not transmit a PRACH in a transmission occasion, Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping counter. If due to power allocation to PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH/SRS transmissions as described in clause 7.5 , or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or NR-DC operation, the UE transmits a PRACH with reduced power in a transmission occasion, Layer 1 may notify higher layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping counter.
7.5 Prioritizations for transmission power reductions

For single cell operation with two uplink carriers or for operation with carrier aggregation, if a total UE transmit power for PUSCH or PUCCH or PRACH or SRS transmissions on serving cells in a frequency range in a respective transmission occasion \( i \) would exceed \( \hat{P}_{\text {CMAX }}(i) \), where \( \hat{P}_{\text {CMAX }}(i) \) is the linear value of \( P_{C M A X}(i) \) in transmission occasion \( i \) as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] for FR1 and [8-2, TS38.101-2] for FR2, the UE allocates power to PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH/SRS transmissions according to the following priority order (in descending order) so that the
