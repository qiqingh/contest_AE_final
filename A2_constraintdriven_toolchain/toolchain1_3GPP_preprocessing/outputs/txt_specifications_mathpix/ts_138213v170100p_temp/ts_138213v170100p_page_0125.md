- if the UE is not configured to perform frequency hopping for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission across slots and the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for a repetition of the PUCCH transmission within a slot, the frequency hopping pattern between the first PRB and the second PRB is same within each slot

If the UE determines that, for a repetition of a PUCCH transmission in a slot, the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission is smaller than the value provided by nrofSymbols for the corresponding PUCCH format, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH repetition in the slot.

A SS/PBCH block symbol is a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with candidate SS/PBCH block index corresponding to the SS/PBCH block index indicated to a UE by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBl or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon or, if the UE is not provided DLorJoint-TCIState or followUnifiedTCIstate, by ssbPositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI associated to physical cell ID with active TCI states.

For unpaired spectrum, the UE determines the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots for a PUCCH transmission starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214] for CSI reporting and having
- an UL symbol, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbol that is not SS/PBCH block symbol provided by startingSymbollndex as a first symbol, and
- consecutive UL symbols, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbols that are not SS/PBCH block symbols, starting from the first symbol, equal to or larger than a number of symbols provided by nrofsymbols

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the UE determines the \( N_{\mathrm{PUCCH}}^{\text {repeat }} \) slots for a PUCCH transmission as the \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }} \) consecutive slots starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214] for CSI reporting.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) of slots and the UE would transmit a PUSCH with repetition Type A or with TB processing over multiple slots over a second number of slots, and the PUCCH transmission would overlap with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots, and the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are satisfied in the overlapping slots, the UE transmits the PUCCH and does not transmit the PUSCH in the overlapping slots.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) of slots and the UE would transmit a PUSCH with repetition Type B over a second number of slots, and the PUCCH transmission would overlap with actual PUSCH repetitions in one or more slots, and the conditions in clause 9.25 for multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are satisfied for the overlapping actual PUSCH repetitions, the UE transmits the PUCCH and does not transmit the overlapping actual PUSCH repetitions.

A UE does not multiplex different UCI types in a PUCCH transmission with repetitions over \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}>1 \) slots. If a UE would transmit a first PUCCH over more than one slot and at least a second PUCCH over one or more slots, and the transmissions of the first PUCCH and the second PUCCH would overlap in a number of slots then, for each slot of the number of slots and with UCI type priority of HARQ-ACK \( > \) SR \( > \) CSI with higher priority \( > \) CSI with lower priority
- the UE does not expect the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCHs to start at a same slot and include a UCI type with same priority
- if the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCH s include a UCI type with same priority, the UE transmits the PUCCH starting at an earlier slot and does not transmit the PUCCH starting at a later slot
- if the first PUCCH and any of the second PUCCHs do not include a UCI type with same priority, the UE transmits the PUCCH that includes the UCI type with higher priority and does not transmit the PUCCH that include the UCI type with lower priority

When a PUCCH resource used for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission by a UE includes first and second spatial settings, or first and second sets of power control parameters, as described in [11, TS 38.321] and in clause 7.2.1, the UE
- uses the first and second spatial settings, or the first and second sets of power control parameters, for first and second repetitions of the PUCCH transmission, respectively, when \( N_{\text {PUCCH }}^{\text {repeat }}=2 \),
