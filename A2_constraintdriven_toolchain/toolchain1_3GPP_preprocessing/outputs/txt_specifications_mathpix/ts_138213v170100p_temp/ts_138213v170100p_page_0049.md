ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- Configuration of physical random access channel (PRACH) transmission parameters (PRACH preamble format, time resources, and frequency resources for PRACH transmission).
- Parameters for determining the root sequences and their cyclic shifts in the PRACH preamble sequence set (index to logical root sequence table, cyclic shift ( \( N_{\mathrm{CS}} \) ), and set type (unrestricted, restricted set A , or restricted set B)).

From the physical layer perspective, the Type-1 L1 random access procedure includes the transmission of random access preamble (Msg1) in a PRACH, random access response (RAR) message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (Msg2), and when applicable, the transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant, and PDSCH for contention resolution.

From the physical layer perspective, the Type-2 L1 random access procedure includes the transmission of random access preamble in a PRACH and of a PUSCH (MsgA) and the reception of a RAR message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (MsgB), and when applicable, the transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a fallback RAR UL grant, and PDSCH for contention resolution.

If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order to the UE, a PRACH transmission is with a same SCS as a PRACH transmission initiated by higher layers.

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE detects a PDCCH order, the UE uses the UL/SUL indicator field value from the detected PDCCH order to determine the UL carrier for the corresponding PRACH transmission.
8.1 Random access preamble

Physical random access procedure is triggered upon request of a PRACH transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order. A configuration by higher layers for a PRACH transmission includes the following:
- A configuration for PRACH transmission [4, TS 38.211].
- A preamble index, a preamble \( \mathrm{SCS}, P_{\text {PRACH,target, a corresponding RA-RNTI, and a PRACH resource. }} \)

A PRACH is transmitted using the selected PRACH format with transmission power \( P_{\mathrm{PRACH}, b, f, c}(i) \), as described in clause 7.4 , on the indicated PRACH resource.

For Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number \( N \) of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a number \( R \) of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB.

For Type-2 random access procedure with common configuration of PRACH occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number \( N \) of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB and a number \( Q \) of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion by msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO. The PRACH transmission can be on a subset of PRACH occasions associated with a same SS/PBCH block index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle for a UE provided with a PRACH mask index by msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex according to [11, TS 38.321].

For Type-2 random access procedure with separate configuration of PRACH occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number \( N \) of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a number \( R \) of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion by msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB when provided; otherwise, by ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCBPreamblesPerSSB.

For Type-1 random access procedure, or for Type-2 random access procedure with separate configuration of PRACH occasions from Type 1 random access procedure, if \( N<1 \), one SS/PBCH block index is mapped to \( 1 / N \) consecutive valid PRACH occasions and \( R \) contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with the SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index 0 . If \( N \geq 1, R \) contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with SS/PBCH block index \( n, 0 \leq n \leq N-1 \), per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index \( n \cdot N_{\text {preamble }}^{\text {total }} / N \) where \( N_{\text {preamble }}^{\text {total }} \) is provided by totalNumberOfRA-Preambles for Type-1 random access procedure, or by msgA-TotalNumberOfRA-Preambles for Type-2 random access procedure with separate configuration of PRACH occasions from a Type 1 random access procedure, and is an integer multiple of \( N \).
