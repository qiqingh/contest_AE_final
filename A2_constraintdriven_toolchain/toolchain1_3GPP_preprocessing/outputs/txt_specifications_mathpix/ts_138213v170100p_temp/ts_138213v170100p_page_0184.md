ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

not expect to cancel the PUSCH transmission or the SRS transmission before a corresponding symbol that is \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) assuming that \( d_{2,1}=0 \) after a last symbol of the PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format 2_4.

A UE that detects a DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell cancels a PUSCH transmission or an actual repetition of a PUSCH transmission [6, TS 38.214] if the PUSCH transmission is with repetition Type B, as determined in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or an SRS transmission on the serving cell if, respectively,
- the transmission is PUSCH with priority 0 , if the UE is provided uplinkCancellationPriority,
- a group of symbols, from the \( T_{\mathrm{Cl}} \) symbols, has at least one bit value of ' 1 ' in the corresponding set of \( N_{\mathrm{Bl}} \) bits in the DCI format 2_4 and includes a symbol of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission or of the SRS transmission, and
- a group of PRBs, from the \( B_{\mathrm{Cl}} \mathrm{PRBs} \), has a corresponding bit value of ' 1 ' in the set of bits corresponding to the group of symbols in the DCI format 2_4 and includes a PRB of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission or of the SRS transmission,
where
- the cancellation of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission includes all symbols from the earliest symbol of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission that is in a group of symbols having corresponding bit values of ' 1 ' in the DCI format 2_4;
- the cancellation of the SRS transmission includes only symbols that are in one or more groups of symbols having corresponding bit values of ' 1 ' in the DCI format 2_4.

If, based on an indication by a DCI format 2_4, a UE cancels a PUSCH transmission or an SRS transmission, the UE does not expect to be scheduled by a second DCI format to transmit a PUSCH or an SRS over symbols that include symbols of the cancelled PUSCH transmission or SRS transmission, where the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the second DCI format is later than the first symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format 2_4.
11.3 Group TPC commands for PUCCH/PUSCH

For PUCCH transmission on a serving cell, a UE can be provided
- a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI for a DCI format 2_2 by tpc-PUCCH-RNTI
- a field in DCI format 2_2 is a TPC command of 2 bits mapping to \( \delta_{\mathrm{PUCCH}, b, f, c} \) values as described in clause 7.2.1
- an index for a location in DCI format 22 of a first bit for a TPC command field for the PCell, or for a carrier of the PCell by tpc-IndexPCell
- an index for a location in DCI format 22 of a first bit for a TPC command field for a PUCCH-sSCell in the primary PUCCH cell group, by tpc-IndexsScell
- an index for a location in DCI format 22 of a first bit for a TPC command field for the PUCCH-SCell or for a carrier for the PUCCH-SCell by tpc-IndexPUCCH-Scell
- an index for a location in DCI format 2_2 of a first bit for a TPC command field for a PUCCH-sSCell in the secondary PUCCH cell group, by tpc-IndexsScell-secondaryPUCCHgroup
- a mapping for the PUCCH power control adjustment state \( l \in\{0,1\} \), by a corresponding \( \{0,1\} \) value of a closed loop index field that is appended to the TPC command field in DCI format 22 if the UE indicates a capability to support two PUCCH power control adjustment states by twoDifferentTPC-Loop-PUCCH, and if the UE is configured for two PUCCH power control adjustment states by twoPUCCH-PC-AdjustmentStates

The UE is also provided on a serving cell with a configuration for a search space set \( s \) and a corresponding CORESET \( p \) for monitoring PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 2 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI as described in clause 10.1.

For PUSCH transmission on a serving cell, a UE can be provided
- a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI for a DCI format 2_2 by tpc-PUSCH-RNTI
