SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or the UE does not correctly receive a corresponding transport block within the window, the UE procedure is as described in [11, TS 38.321].
8.2A Random access response - Type-2 random access procedure

In response to a transmission of a PRACH and a PUSCH , or to a transmission of only a PRACH if the PRACH preamble is mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 10 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding MsgB-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PUSCH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Typel-PDCCH CSS set. If \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\mathrm{UE}} \) or \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\text {commnon }} \), as defined in [4, TS 38.211], is not zero, the window starts after an additional \( T_{\mathrm{TA}}+k_{\mathrm{mac}} \) msec where \( T_{\mathrm{TA}} \) is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and \( k_{\mathrm{mac}} \) is provided by \( K \)-Mac or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K \)-Mac is not provided. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by msgB-ResponseWindow.

In response to a transmission of a PRACH , if the PRACH preamble is not mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding MsgB-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by msgB-ResponseWindow.

If the UE detects the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers indicate to the physical layer
- an uplink grant if the RAR message(s) is for fallbackRAR and a random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission is identified, and the UE procedure continues as described in clauses \( 8.2,8.3 \), and 8.4 when the UE detects a RAR UL grant, or
- transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if the RAR message(s) is for successRAR, where
- a PUCCH resource for the transmission of the PUCCH is indicated by PUCCH resource indicator field of 4 bits in the successRAR from a PUCCH resource set that is provided by pucch-ResourceCommon
- a slot for the PUCCH transmission is indicated by a HARQ Feedback Timing Indicator field of 3 bits in the successRAR having a value \( k \) from \( \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} \) for \( \mu \leq 3 \), from \( \{7,8,12,16,20,24,28,32\} \) for \( \mu=5 \), and from \( \{13,16,24,32,40,48,56,64\} \) for \( \mu=6 \) and, with reference to slots for PUCCH transmission having duration \( T_{\text {slot }} \), the slot is determined as \( n+k+\Delta+2^{\mu} \cdot K_{\text {cell, offset }} \), where \( n \) is a slot of the PDSCH reception, \( \Delta \) is as defined for PUSCH transmission in Table 6.1.2.1.1-5 of [6, TS 38.214], \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP, and \( K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) is provided by CellSpecific_Koffset; otherwise, if not provided, \( K_{\text {cell, offset }}=0 \)
- the UE does not expect the first symbol of the PUCCH transmission to be after the last symbol of the PDSCH reception by a time smaller than \( N_{T, 1}+0.5 \mathrm{msec} \) where \( N_{T, 1} \) is the PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214]
- for operation with shared spectrum channel access, a channel access type and CP extension [15, TS 37.213] for a PUCCH transmission is indicated by a ChannelAccess-CPext field in the successRAR as defined in Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in TS 38.212 or Table 7.3.1.1.1-4A in TS 38.212 if ChannelAccessMode-rl6 = "semiStatic" is provided
- the PUCCH transmission is with a same spatial domain transmission filter and in a same active UL BWP as a last PUSCH transmission

If the UE detects the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if the UE correctly detects the transport block or NACK value if the UE incorrectly detects the transport block and the time alignment timer is running [11, TS 38.321].
