A reference SCS configuration \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}} \), or \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{DL}} \), or \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{UL}} \), or \( \mu_{\mathrm{SFI}, \mathrm{SUL}} \) is either 0 , or 1 , or 2 for FR1 and is either 2 or 3 for FR2.

For a set of symbols of a slot, a UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 2.0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink and to detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot, a UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 2.0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols in the slot as downlink and to detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated by a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) as being within a remaining channel occupancy duration either by a channel occupancy duration field or by an SFI-index field, a UE does not expect to detect at a later time a DCI format 2_0 indicating, either by a channel occupancy duration field or by an SFI-index field, that any symbol from the set of symbols is not within a remaining channel occupancy duration.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as downlink/uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format \( 2-0 \) with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink/downlink, respectively, or as flexible.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to SS/PBCH blocks with candidate SS/PBCH block indices corresponding to the SS/PBCH block indexes indicated to a UE by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1, or by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon, as described in clause 4.1 or, if the UE is not provided DLorJoint-TCIState or followUnifiedTCIstate, by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI associated to physical cell ID with active TCI states, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format \( 2-0 \) with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion and \( N_{\text {gap }} \) symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as described in clause 8.1, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 2.0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as downlink.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by pdcch-ConfigSIBI in MIB for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format \( 2-0 \) with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated if provided, or when tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated are not provided to the UE, and if the UE detects a DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) providing a format for the slot using a slot format value other than 255
- if one or more symbols from the set of symbols are symbols in a CORESET configured to the UE for PDCCH monitoring, the UE receives PDCCH in the CORESET only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) indicates that the one or more symbols are downlink symbols
- if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as flexible and the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot
- if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as flexible and the UE detects a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot the UE transmits the PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot
- if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as flexible, and the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS, or the UE does not detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE does not transmit or receive in the set of symbols of the slot
- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the PDSCH or the CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as downlink and, if applicable, the set of symbols is within remaining channel occupancy duration
