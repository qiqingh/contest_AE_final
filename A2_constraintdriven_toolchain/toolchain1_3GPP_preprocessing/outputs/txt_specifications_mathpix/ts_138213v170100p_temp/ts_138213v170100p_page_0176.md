If neither CO-DurationPerCell-r16 nor SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell are provided and if ChannelAccessModerl6 \( = \) "semiStatic" is provided, the procedures in this clause apply with assuming a channel occupancy time defined in clause 4.3 of [15, TS 37.213] is the remaining channel occupancy duration if a DL transmission burst(s) is detected within the channel occupancy time.

A SFI-index field value in a DCI format 20 indicates to a UE a slot format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format \( 2 \_0 \). The number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The SFI-index field includes \( \max \left\{\left[\log _{2}(\operatorname{maxSFI}\right.\right. \) inde \( \left.\left.x+1)\right], 1\right\} \) bits where maxSFlindex is the maximum value of the values provided by corresponding slotFormatCombinationId. A slot format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where ' \( D \) ' denotes a downlink symbol, 'U' denotes an uplink symbol, and ' \( F \) ' denotes a flexible symbol.

If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format \( 2 \_0 \), provided to a UE for the search space set \( S \) by monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset, is smaller than a duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same format for the slot.

A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format \( 2 \_0 \) on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.
