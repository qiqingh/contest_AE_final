total UE transmit power for transmissions on serving cells in the frequency range is smaller than or equal to \( \hat{P}_{\text {cmax }} \) ( \( i \) ) for that frequency range in every symbol of transmission occasion \( i \). When determining a total transmit power for serving cells in a frequency range in a symbol of transmission occasion \( i \), the UE does not include power for transmissions starting after the symbol of transmission occasion \( i \). The total UE transmit power in a symbol of a slot is defined as the sum of the linear values of UE transmit powers for PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS in the symbol of the slot.
- PRACH transmission on the PCell
- PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with higher priority index according to clause 9
- For PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with same priority index
- PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, and/or SR, and/or LRR, or PUSCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information
- PUCCH transmission with CSI or PUSCH transmission with CSI
- PUSCH transmission without HARQ-ACK information or CSI and, for Type-2 random access procedure, PUSCH transmission on the PCell
- SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than semi-persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other than the PCell

In case of same priority order and for operation with carrier aggregation, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the primary cell of the MCG or the SCG over transmissions on a secondary cell. In case of same priority order and for operation with two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the carrier where the UE is configured to transmit PUCCH. If PUCCH is not configured for any of the two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the non-supplementary UL carrier.
7.6 Dual connectivity
7.6.1 EN-DC

If a UE is configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a SCG using NR radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{LTe}} \) for transmissions on the MCG by \( p \)-MaxEUTRA and a maximum power \( P_{\mathrm{NR}} \) for transmissions in FR1 on the SCG by \( p-N R-F R I \).

The UE determines a transmission power for the MCG as described in [13, TS 36.213] using \( P_{\text {LTE }} \) as the maximum transmission power. The UE determines transmission power for the SCG in FR1 as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using \( P_{\mathrm{NR}} \) as the maximum transmission power. The UE determines transmission power for the SCG in FR2 as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 .

A UE does not expect to be configured for operation with shortened TTI and/or processing time [13, TS 36.213] on a cell that is included in an EN-DC configuration.

If a UE is configured with \( \hat{P}_{\text {LTE }}+\hat{P}_{\text {NR }}>\hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\text {EN-DC }} \), where \( \hat{P}_{\text {LTE }} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\text {LTE }}, \hat{P}_{\text {NR }} \) is the linear value of \( P_{\text {NR }} \), and \( \hat{P}_{\text {Total }}^{\mathrm{EN}-\mathrm{DC}} \) is the linear value of a configured maximum transmission power for EN-DC operation as defined in [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for FR1, the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as follows.
- If the UE is configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA (by \( t d m \)-Pattern Config or by \( t d m \) PatternConfig2 in [13, TS 36.213])
- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE does not transmit in a slot on the SCG in FR1 when a corresponding subframe on the MCG is an UL subframe in the reference TDD configuration.
- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, and does not indicate a capability tdm-restrictionDualTX-FDD-endc-r16 in [16, TS 38.306], and is configured with tdm-PatternConfig2, the UE does not transmit on the SCG in FR1 when the UE has overlapped transmission on a subframe on the MCG.
