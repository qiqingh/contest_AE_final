If the UE indicates a capability to receive more than one PDSCH per slot, for occasions of candidate PDSCH receptions corresponding to rows of \( R \) associated with a same value of \( b_{r, k, n_{D}} \), where \( b_{r, k, n_{D}} \in B \), the UE does not expect to receive more than one PDSCH in a same DL slot associated with a same coresetPoollndex value if provided, or if coresetPoollndex is not provided.

If a UE receives a SPS PDSCH, or a SPS PDSCH release, or TCI state update, or a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions and if
- the UE is configured with one serving cell, and
- \( C\left(M_{A, c}\right)=1 \), and
- PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission is provided to the UE
the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for the transport block in the PDSCH, or only for the SPS PDSCH release, or only for the TCI state update.

If a UE receives a SPS PDSCH, or a SPS PDSCH release, or TCI state update, or a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions and if
- the UE is configured with more than one serving cells, or
- \( \quad C\left(M_{A, c}\right)>1 \), and
- PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission is provided to the UE
the UE repeats \( N_{\text {HARQ-ACK }}^{\text {CBG/TB, } m a x} \) times the HARQ-ACK information for the transport block in the PDSCH, or for the SPS PDSCH release, or for the TCI state update.
