where \( N_{\text {CCE } p} \) is a number of CCEs in CORESET \( p \) of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format as described in clause 10.1, \( n_{\text {CCE }, p} \) is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and \( \Delta_{\text {PRI }} \) is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format. When the PDCCH reception includes first and second PDCCH candidates from respective first and second search space sets, as described in clause 10.1, the CORESET is associated with the search space set having the smaller index. If
- the first search space set has larger index than the second search space set and includes the first PDCCH candidate and a third PDCCH candidate that have same first CCE index and CCE aggregation levels 8 and 16, or 16 and 8, respectively,
- the second search space set includes the second PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the first PDCCH candidate, and a fourth PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the third PDCCH candidate,
- the CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType \( = \) 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and
- the second PDCCH candidate has different first CCE index than the fourth PDCCH candidate
the UE determines \( n_{\text {CCE }, 0} \) from the PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level 16 among the second PDCCH candidate and the fourth PDCCH candidate.

If the DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, \( \Delta_{\mathrm{PRI}}=0 \).

If a UE determines a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH or detects a first DCI format indicating a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a slot and also detects at a later time a second DCI format indicating a second resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the slot, the UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information corresponding to the second DCI format in a PUCCH resource in the slot if the PDCCH reception that includes the second DCI format is not earlier than \( N_{3} \). \( (2048+144) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{c} \) from the beginning of a first symbol of the first resource for PUCCH transmission in the slot where, \( \kappa \) and \( T_{c} \) are defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211] and \( \mu \) corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of the PDCCHs providing the DCI formats and the SCS configuration of the PUCCH.
