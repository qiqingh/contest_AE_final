A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestIDForMTRPBFR a first configuration for LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, a second configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 .

A UE can be configured by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0 .

The UE is also configured a periodicity \( S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }} \) in symbols or slots and an offset \( S R_{\text {OFFSET }} \) in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If \( S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }} \) is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number \( n_{s_{1} f}^{\mu}[4 \), TS 38.211] in a frame with number \( n_{f} \) if \( \left(n_{f} \cdot N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}+n_{s_{f} f}^{\mu}-S R_{\text {OFFSET }}\right) \bmod S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 \).

If \( S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }} \) is one slot, the UE expects that \( S R_{\text {OFFSET }}=0 \) and every slot is a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH.

If \( S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }} \) is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to start in a symbol with index \( l[4, \mathrm{TS} 38.211] \) if \( \left(l-l_{0} \bmod S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }}\right) \bmod S R_{\text {PERIODICITY }}=0 \) where \( l_{0} \) is the value of startingSymbollndex.

If the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH, the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is smaller than the value provided by nrofSymbols, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in the slot.

SR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.

The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining \( m_{0} \) as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting \( m_{\mathrm{cs}}=0 \). For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1 , the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting \( b(0)=0 \).
9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types

This clause is applicable to the case that a UE has resources for PUCCH transmissions or for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time and each PUCCH transmission is over a single slot without repetitions. Any case that a PUCCH transmission is with repetitions over multiple slots is described in clause 9.2.6. If a UE is configured with multiple PUCCH resources in a slot to transmit CSI reports
- if the UE is not provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList or if PUCCH resources for transmissions of CSI reports do not overlap in the slot, the UE determines a first resource corresponding to a CSI report with the highest priority [6, TS 38.214]
- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting
- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2 and do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting
- if the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.

A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include DL
