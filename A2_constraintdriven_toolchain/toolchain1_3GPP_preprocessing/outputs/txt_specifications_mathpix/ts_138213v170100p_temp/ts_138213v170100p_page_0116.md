For each PUCCH resource in the set \( Q \) that satisfies the aforementioned timing conditions, when applicable,
- the UE transmits a PUCCH using the PUCCH resource if the PUCCH resource does not overlap in time with a PUSCH transmission after multiplexing UCI following the procedures described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2
- the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI reports in a PUSCH if the PUCCH resource overlaps in time with a PUSCH transmission, as described in clause 9.3, and does not transmit SR. In case the PUCCH resource overlaps in time with multiple PUSCH transmissions, the PUSCH for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI is selected as described in clause 9. If the PUSCH transmission by the UE is not in response to a DCI format detection and the UE multiplexes only CSI reports, the timing conditions are not applicable
- the UE does not expect the resource to overlap with a second resource of a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots if the resource is obtained from a group of resources that do not overlap with the second resource.
clauses 9.2.5.0, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2 assume the following
- resources for transmissions of UCI types, prior to multiplexing or dropping, overlap in a slot
- multiplexing conditions of corresponding UCI types in a single PUCCH are satisfied, and
- the UE does not transmit any PUSCH time-overlapping with PUCCH in the slot.
9.2.5.0 UE procedure for prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH and DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a PUCCH

The priority value of a PUCCH transmission is as described in clause 16.2.4.3.1.
For prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH and DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a second PUCCH
- if the second PUCCH has priority index 1 ,
- if sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC is provided
- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if a smallest priority value of the first PUCCH is smaller than \( s l \) -PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC; otherwise, the UE transmits the second PUCCH
- else
- the UE transmits the second PUCCH
- else
- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if the smallest priority value of the first PUCCH is smaller than slPriorityThreshold; otherwise, the UE transmits the second PUCCH

When the UE determines to transmit the second PUCCH, the UE determines a single resource for multiplexing UCI in the second PUCCH as described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2.
9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH

In the following, a UE is configured to transmit \( K \) PUCCHs for respective \( K \) SRs in a slot, as determined by a set of schedulingRequestResourceld, a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, and a schedulingRequestResourceld associated with schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell, with SR transmission occasions that would overlap with a transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information from the UE in the slot or with a transmission of a PUCCH with CSI report(s) from the UE in the slot.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0 , the UE transmits the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE determines a value of \( m_{0} \) and \( m_{\mathrm{CS}} \) for computing a value of cyclic
