- in clauses 7.1.1,7.2.1, and 7.3.1, the RS index \( q_{d} \) for obtaining the downlink pathloss estimate for PUSCH, PUCCH, and SRS transmission is provided by PL-RS associated with or included in the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIstate except for SRS transmission that is not provided uselndicatedTCIState
- in clause 7.1.1, if \( p 0 \)-Alpha-CLID-PUSCH-Set is provided, the values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE PUSCH, } b, f, c}(j), \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \), and the PUSCH power control adjustment state \( l \) are provided by \( p 0 \)-Alpha-CLID-PUSCH-Set associated with the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIstate
- in clause 7.2.1, if \( p 0 \)-Alpha-CLID-PUCCHSet is provided, the values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {PUCCH }, b, f, c}\left(q_{u}\right) \) and the PUCCH power control adjustment state \( l \) are provided by p0-Alpha-CLID-PUCCH-Set associated with the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIstate
- in clause 7.3.1, if p0-Alpha-CLID-SRS-Set is provided,
- if useIndicatedTCIState is provided for a SRS resource set, the values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {SRS }, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right), \alpha_{\text {SRS }, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \), and SRS power control adjustment state \( l \) are provided by p0-Alpha-CLID-SRS-Set associated with the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState
- else, if uselndicatedTCIState is not provided for a SRS resource set and for a first SRS resource from the SRS resource set, the values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {SRS }, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right), \alpha_{\text {SRS }, b, f, c}\left(q_{s}\right) \), and SRS power control adjustment state \( l \) are provided by p0-Alpha-CLID-SRS-Set associated with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState of an SRS resource with lowest SRS-Resourceld in the SRS resource set and a RS index \( q_{d} \) for obtaining a pathloss estimate for the SRS transmission is provided by PL-RS associated with or included in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState of an SRS resource with lowest SRS-Resourceld in the SRS resource set

In the remaining of this clause, if a PDCCH reception by a UE includes two PDCCH candidates from corresponding search space sets, as described in clause 10.1
- a PDCCH monitoring occasion is the union of the PDCCH monitoring occasions for the two PDCCH candidates
- the end of the PDCCH reception is the end of the PDCCH candidate that ends later

The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10,11.1, and 11.1.1.
7.1 Physical uplink shared channel

For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP \( b \), as described in clause 12 , of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \), a UE first calculates a linear value \( \hat{P}_{\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \) of the transmit power \( P_{\text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \), with parameters as defined in clause 7.1.1. For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format other than DCI format \( 0 \_0 \), or configured by ConfiguredGrantConfig or semiPersistentOnPUSCH, if txConfig in PUSCH-Config is set to 'codebook',
- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is provided, the UE scales \( \hat{P}_{\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c}\left(i, j, q_{d}, l\right) \) by \( s \) where:
- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerModel, and each SRS resource in the SRSResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook' has more than one SRS port, \( s \) is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource
- if ul-FullPowerTransmission in PUSCH-Config is set to fullpowerMode2,
- \( s=1 \) for full power TPMIs reported by the UE [16, TS 38.306], and \( s \) is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over a number of SRS ports for remaining TPMIs, where the number of SRS ports is associated with an SRS resource indicated by an SRI field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission if more than one SRS resource is configured in the SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook', or indicated by Type 1 configured grant, or the number of SRS ports is associated with the SRS resource if only one SRS resource is configured in the SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook',
- \( s=1 \), if an SRS resource with a single port is indicated by an SRI field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission when more than one SRS resource is provided in the SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook', or indicated by Type 1 configured grant, or if only one SRS resource with a single port is provided in the SRS-ResourceSet with usage set to 'codebook', and
