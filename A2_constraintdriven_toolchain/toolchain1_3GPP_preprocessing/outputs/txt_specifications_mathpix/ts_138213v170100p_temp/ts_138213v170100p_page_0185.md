- a field in DCI format 2_2 is a TPC command of 2 bits mapping to \( \delta_{\mathrm{PUSCH}, b, f, c} \) values as described in clause 7.1.1
- an index for a location in DCI format 2_2 of a first bit for a TPC command field for an uplink carrier of the serving cell by tpc-Index
- an index for a location in DCI format 2_2 of a first bit for a TPC command field for a supplementary uplink carrier of the serving cell by tpc-IndexSUL
- an index of the serving cell by targetCell. If targetCell is not provided, the serving cell is the cell of the PDCCH reception for DCI format 2_2
- a mapping for the PUSCH power control adjustment state \( l \in\{0,1\} \), by a corresponding \( \{0,1\} \) value of a closed loop index field that is appended to the TPC command field for the uplink carrier or for the supplementary uplink carrier of the serving cell in DCI format 2 2 if the UE indicates a capability to support two PUSCH power control adjustment states, by twoDifferentTPC-Loop-PUSCH, and if the UE is configured for two PUSCH power control adjustment states by twoPUSCH-PC-AdjustmentStates

The UE is also provided for the serving cell of the PDCCH reception for DCI format 2_2 with a configuration for a search space set \( s \) and a corresponding CORESET \( p \) for monitoring PDCCH candidates for DCI format \( 2 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI as described in clause 10.1.
11.4 SRS switching

DCI format 2_3 is applicable for uplink carrier(s) of serving cells where a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission or for uplink carrier(s) of a serving cell where srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates indicates a separate power control adjustment state between SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions.

A UE configured by higher layers with parameter carrierSwitching is provided
- a TPC-SRS-RNTI for a DCI format 2 _ 3 by tpc-SRS-RNTI
- an index of a serving cell where the UE interrupts transmission in order to transmit SRS on one or more other serving cells by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex
- an indication of an uplink carrier where the UE interrupts transmission in order to transmit SRS on one or more other serving cells by srs-SwitchFromCarrier
- a DCI format 2_3 field configuration type by typeA or typeB
- for typeA, an index for a set of serving cells is provided by cc-SetIndex, indexes of serving cells in the set of serving cells are provided by cc-IndexInOneCC-Set, and a DCI format 2_3 field includes a TPC command for each serving cell from the set of serving cells and can also include a SRS request for SRS transmission on the set of serving cells
- for typeB, DCI format 2_3 field includes a TPC command for a serving cell index and can also include a SRS request for SRS transmission on the serving cell
- an indication for a serving cell for whether or not a field in DCI format 2 _ 3 includes a SRS request by fieldTypeFormat \( 2-3 \) where a value of \( 0 / 1 \) indicates absence/presence of the SRS request - a mapping for a 2 bit SRS request to SRS resource sets is as provided in [6, TS 38.214]
- an index for a location in DCI format 2_3 of a first bit for a field for a non-supplementary uplink carrier of the serving cell by startingBitOfFormat2-3
- an index for a location in DCI format 2 _ 3 of a first bit for a field for a supplementary uplink carrier of the serving cell by startingBitOfFormat2-3SUL-v1530

12 Bandwidth part operation
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both MCG and SCG
