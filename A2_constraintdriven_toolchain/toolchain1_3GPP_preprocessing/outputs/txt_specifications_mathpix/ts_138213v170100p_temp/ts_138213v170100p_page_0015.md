carriers in the TAG. \( N_{\text {TA, max }} \) is determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and for all configured initial UL BWPs provided by initialUplinkBWP. The uplink slot \( n \) is the last slot among uplink slot(s) overlapping with the slot(s) of PDSCH reception assuming \( T_{T A}=0 \), where the PDSCH provides the timing advance command and \( T_{T A} \) is defined in [4, TS 38.211].

If a UE changes an active UL BWP between a time of a timing advance command reception and a time of applying a corresponding adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE determines the timing advance command value based on the SCS of the new active UL BWP. If the UE changes an active UL BWP after applying an adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE assumes a same absolute timing advance command value before and after the active UL BWP change.

If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance command as described in [10, TS 38.133], the UE changes \( N_{\text {TA }} \) accordingly.

If two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command, the latter slot is reduced in duration relative to the former slot. The UE does not change \( N_{T A} \) during an actual transmission time window for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission [6, TS 38.214].
4.3 Timing for secondary cell activation / deactivation

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, when a UE receives in a PDSCH an activation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot \( n \), the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [ 10 , TS 38.133] and no earlier than slot \( n+k \), except for the following:
- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell that is active in slot \( n+k \)
- the actions related to the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell [11, TS 38.321] that the UE applies in slot \( n+k \)
- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell which is not active in slot \( n+k \) that the UE applies in the earliest slot after \( n+k \) in which the serving cell is active.

The value of \( k \) is \( m+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subfram } \mathrm{e}, \mu}+1 \) where slot \( n+m \) is a slot indicated for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.2 .3 and \( N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sublame, } \mu} \) is a number of slots per subframe for the SCS configuration \( \mu \) of the PUCCH transmission as defined in [4, TS 38.211].

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if a UE receives a deactivation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot \( n \), the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133], except for the actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in slot \( n+k \).

If the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell expires in slot \( n \), the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133], except for the actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 \cdot N_{\text {slon }}^{\text {subrame, } \mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for PDSCH reception on the secondary cell.

5 Radio link monitoring
The downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/insync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS

If the UE is configured with a SCG, as described in [12, TS 38.331], and the parameter rff-TimersAndConstants is provided by higher layers and is not set to release, the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell of the SCG is
