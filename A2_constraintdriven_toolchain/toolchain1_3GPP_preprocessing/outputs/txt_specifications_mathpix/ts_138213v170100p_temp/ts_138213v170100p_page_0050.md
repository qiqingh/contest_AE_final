For Type-2 random access procedure with common configuration of PRACH occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, if \( N<1 \), one SS/PBCH block index is mapped to \( 1 / N \) consecutive valid PRACH occasions and \( Q \) contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with the SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index \( R \). If \( N \geq 1, Q \) contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with SS/PBCH block index \( n, 0 \leq n \leq N-1 \), per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index \( n \cdot N_{\text {preamble }}^{\text {total }} / N+R \), where \( N_{\text {preamble }}^{\text {total }} \) is provided by totalNumberOfRA-Preambles for Type-1 random access procedure.

For link recovery, a UE is provided \( N \mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH} \) block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACHOccasion in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For a dedicated RACH configuration provided by RACH-ConfigDedicated, if cfra is provided, a UE is provided \( N \) SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACH-Occasion in occasions. If \( N<1 \), one SS/PBCH block index is mapped to \( 1 / N \) consecutive valid PRACH occasions. If \( N \geq 1 \), all consecutive \( N \) SS/PBCH block indexes are associated with one PRACH occasion.

SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or in ServingCellConfigCommon are mapped to valid PRACH occasions in the following order where the parameters are described in [4, TS 38.211].
- First, in increasing order of preamble indexes within a single PRACH occasion
- Second, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions
- Third, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot
- Fourth, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots

An association period, starting from frame 0 , for mapping SS/PBCH block indexes to PRACH occasions is the smallest value in the set determined by the PRACH configuration period according Table 8.1-1 such that \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}}^{\mathrm{SSB}} \) SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to the PRACH occasions within the association period, where a UE obtains \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}}^{\mathrm{SSB}} \) from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or in ServingCellConfigCommon. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PRACH occasions mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles that are not mapped to \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}}^{\mathrm{SSB}} \mathrm{SS} / \mathrm{PBCH} \) block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles. An association pattern period includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PRACH occasions and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 160 msec. PRACH occasions not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PRACH transmissions.

For a PRACH transmission by a UE triggered by a PDCCH order, the PRACH mask index field [5, TS 38.212], if the value of the random access preamble index field is not zero, indicates the PRACH occasion for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the SS/PBCH block index indicated by the SS/PBCH block index field of the PDCCH order. If the UE is provided \( K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) by CellSpecific_Koffset, the PRACH occasion is after slot \( n+2^{\mu} \cdot K_{\text {cell, offset }} \) where \( n \) is the slot of the UL BWP for the PRACH transmission that overlaps with the end of the PDCCH order reception assuming \( T_{\mathrm{TA}}=0 \), and \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission. If the PDCCH reception for the PDCCH order includes two PDCCH candidates from two linked search space sets based on searchSpaceLinking, as described in clause 10.1, the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is the last symbol of the PDCCH candidate that ends later. The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10,11.1, and 11.1.1.

For a PRACH transmission triggered by higher layers, if ssb-ResourceList is provided, the PRACH mask index is indicated by ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex which indicates the PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the selected SS/PBCH block index.

The PRACH occasions are mapped consecutively per corresponding SS/PBCH block index. The indexing of the PRACH occasion indicated by the mask index value is reset per mapping cycle of consecutive PRACH occasions per SS/PBCH block index. The UE selects for a PRACH transmission the PRACH occasion indicated by PRACH mask index value for the indicated SS/PBCH block index in the first available mapping cycle.

For the indicated preamble index, the ordering of the PRACH occasions is
- First, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions
- Second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot
