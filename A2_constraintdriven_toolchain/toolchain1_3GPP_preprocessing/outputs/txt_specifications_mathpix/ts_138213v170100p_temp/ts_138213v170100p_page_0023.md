- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 10 or 11 , first and second \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE PUSCH }, b, f, c}(1) \) values are respectively provided by the values of p0-PUSCH-Alpha and by p0-PUSCH-Alpha 2 in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
- else, \( P_{\text {O_NOMINAL,PUSCH }} f_{, c}(1) \) is provided by \( p 0 \) obtained from \( p 0 \)-PUSCH-Alpha in ConfiguredGrantConfig that provides an index P0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet, or by \( p 0- \) PUSCH for a PUSCH (re)transmission as described in clause 19.1, for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- For \( j \in\{2, \ldots, J-1\}=S_{J} \), a \( P_{0 \_ \text {NOMINAL }, \text { PUSCH }, f_{, c}}(j) \) value, applicable for all \( j \in S_{J} \), is provided by \( p 0 \) provided, for each carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \) and a set of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE } \_ \text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) values are provided by a set of \( p 0 \) in P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet indicated by a respective set of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- If the UE is provided by SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl more than one values of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld and if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes an SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for the SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by \( p 0 \)-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values and determines the value of \( P_{0} \) ue_pusch, \( b, f, c \) ( \( j \) ) from the \( p 0-P U S C H \) AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the SRI field value. If the UE is provided by SRI-PUSCHPowerControl more than one values of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld
- if the DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' and if, the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for the two SRI fields and a set of indexes provided by \( p 0 \)-PUSCH-AlphaSetId that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines first and second values of \( P_{0 \_ \text {ue_pusch }, b, f, c}(j) \) from the \( p 0 \)-PUSCH-AlphaSetld values that are mapped to the values of the first and second SRI fields, respectively.
- if the DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook', the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between
- a set of values for the first SRI field value and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines the first value of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE_PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) from the p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the first SRI field value, and
- a set of values associated with the second SRI field value for a same number of layers as indicated by the first SRI field [5, TS 38.212], and a set of indexes provided by p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines the second value of \( P_{0 \_ \text {ue_pusch } b, f, c}(j) \) from the p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld value that is mapped to the second SRI field value corresponding to Tables 7.3.1.1.2-28/29/30/31 of [5, TS 38.212].
- If the DCI format also includes an open-loop power control parameter set indication field and a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 1 ' and if the DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes an SRI field, the UE determines a value of \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) from a first value in P0-PUSCH-Set with a p0-PUSCH-Setld value mapped to the SRI field value.
- If the UE is provided by SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl more than one values of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld
- if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and an open-loop power control parameter set indication field and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook'
- if a value of the open-loop power control parameter set indication field is ' 0 ', the UE determines two values of \( P_{0_{-} \text {ue_pusch }, b, f, c}(j) \) from the p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld values in SRI-PUSCHPowerControl that are mapped to the two SRI values corresponding to each SRS resource set with usage set to 'codebook'.
