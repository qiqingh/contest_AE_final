For prioritization between SL transmission or PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception and UL transmission other than a PRACH, or a PUSCH scheduled by an UL grant in a RAR and its retransmission, or a PUSCH corresponding to Type-2 random access procedure and its retransmission, or a PUCCH with sidelink HARQ-ACK information report
- if the UL transmission is for a PUSCH or for a PUCCH with priority index 1,
- if sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC is provided
- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission or reception is smaller than sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC; otherwise, the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception
- else
- the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception
- else
- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission(s) or reception is smaller than sl-PriorityThreshold; otherwise, the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception

A PRACH transmission, or a PUSCH scheduled by an UL grant in a RAR and its retransmission, or a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure and its retransmission, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to successRAR, or a PUCCH indicated by a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI has higher priority than a SL transmission or reception.

A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has higher priority than a SL transmission if a priority value of the PUCCH is smaller than a priority value of the SL transmission. The priority value of the PUCCH transmission is as described in clause 16.5. If the priority value of the PUCCH transmission is larger than the priority value of the SL transmission, the SL transmission has higher priority.

A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has higher priority than a PSFCH/SSS/PSBCH block reception if a priority value of the PUCCH is smaller than a priority value of the SL reception. If the priority value of the PUCCH transmission is larger than the priority value of the PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception, the SL reception has higher priority.

When one or more SL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions from the UE, the UE performs the SL transmissions if at least one SL transmission is prioritized over all UL transmissions subject to the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission.

When one or more UL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with multiple non-overlapping SL transmissions, the UE performs the UL transmissions if at least one UL transmission is prioritized over all SL transmissions subject to the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission.

When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping UL transmissions, the UE performs the SL transmission if the SL transmission is prioritized over all UL transmissions subject to both the UE multiplexing and processing timelines with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission, where the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission is same as when one or more SL transmissions overlap in time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions.

When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping UL transmissions, the UE performs the UL transmission if at least one UL transmission is prioritized over the SL transmission subject to both the UE multiplexing and processing timelines with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission, where the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission is same as when one or more SL transmissions overlap in time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions.
16.3 UE procedure for reporting and obtaining control information in PSFCH

Control information provided by a PSFCH transmission includes HARQ-ACK information or conflict information.
