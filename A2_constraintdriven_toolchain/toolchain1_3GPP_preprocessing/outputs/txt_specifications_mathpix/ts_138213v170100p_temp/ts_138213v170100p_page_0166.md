- a ' 10 ' value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the second value in the set of durations
- a '11' value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the third value in the set of durations, if any; otherwise, if the set of durations includes two values, a use of the ' 11 ' value is reserved

A UE can be provided group indexes for a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or USS set by searchSpaceGroupldList-r 17 for PDCCH monitoring on an active DL BWP of a serving cell and, if the UE is not provided PDCCHSkipping DurationList for the active DL BWP of the serving cell, a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and a DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) that schedule PUSCH transmissions and a DCI format 1_1 and a DCI format 1_2 that schedule PDSCH receptions can include a PDCCH monitoring adaptation field of 1 bit or of 2 bits for the serving cell.

If the field has 1 bit and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell
- a ' 0 ' value for the bit indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with other group indexes, if any
- a ' 1 ' value for the bit indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with other group indexes, if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17

If the field has 2 bits and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell
- a ' \( 00^{\prime} \) value for the bit indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with other group indexes, if any
- a ' 01 ' value for the bit indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with other group indexes, if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17
- a ' \( 10^{\prime} \) value for the bit indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 2 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with other group indexes, if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17
- a '11' value is reserved

A UE can be provided a set of durations by PDCCHSkippingDurationList and group indexes for a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or USS set by searchSpaceGroupldList-r 17 for PDCCH monitoring on an active DL BWP of a serving cell and, a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and a DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) that schedule PUSCH transmissions, and a DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) and a DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) that schedule PDSCH receptions can include a PDCCH monitoring adaptation field of 2 bits.

If the set of durations includes one value and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell
- a ' \( 00^{\prime} \) value for the bits indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 , if any
- a '01' value for the bits indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 , if any, and the UE sets the timer value to the one provided by searchSpaceSwitchTimer-r 17
- a ' \( 10^{\prime} \) value for the bits indicates skipping PDCCH monitoring for a duration provided by the value in the set of durations
- a '11' value is reserved

If the set of durations includes two values and for PDCCH monitoring by the UE according to Type3-PDCCH CSS sets or USS sets on active DL BWP of the the serving cell
- a ' \( 00^{\prime} \) value for the bits indicates start of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0 and stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets with group index 1, if any
