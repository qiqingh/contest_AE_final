corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to \( k-1 \) may be transmitted; if MSB \( k \) is set to 0 , the UE assumes that the SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. If MSB \( k, k \geq 1 \), of inOneGroup is set to 1 , and MSB \( m, m \geq 1 \), of groupPresence is set to 1 , the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index determined by \( k \) and \( m \) may be transmitted; otherwise, the UE assumes that the SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE assumes that SS/PBCH blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst transmission window or across discovery burst transmission windows are quasi colocated with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if a value of \( \left(N_{D M-R S}^{P B C H} \bmod N_{S S B}^{Q C L}\right) \) is same among the SS/PBCH blocks. \( N_{D M-R S}^{P B C H} \) is an index of a DM-RS sequence transmitted in a PBCH of a corresponding SS/PBCH block, and \( N_{S S B}^{Q C L} \) is either provided by ssb-PositionQCL or, if ssbPositionQCL is not provided, obtained from a MIB provided by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-1 with \( k_{S S B}< \) 24 [4, TS 38.211]. The UE can determine an SS/PBCH block index according to \( \left(N_{D M-R S}^{P B C H} \bmod N_{S S B}^{Q C L}\right) \), or according to \( \left(\bar{l} \bmod N_{S S B}^{Q C L}\right) \) where \( \bar{l} \) is the candidate SS/PBCH block index. The UE assumes that within a discovery burst transmission window, a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks on a serving cell is not larger than \( N_{S S B}^{Q C L} \) and a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks with a same SS/PBCH block index is not larger than one.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, a UE assumes that SS/PBCH blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst transmission window or across discovery burst transmission windows are quasi colocated with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'type A ' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable, if a value of \( \left(\bar{\imath} \bmod N_{S S B}^{Q C L}\right) \) is same among the SS/PBCH blocks, where \( \bar{\imath} \) is the candidate SS/PBCH block index. \( N_{S S B}^{Q C L} \) is either provided by ssb-PositionQCL or, if ssb-PositionQCL is not provided, obtained from a MIB provided by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-2. The UE can determine an SS/PBCH block index according to \( \left(\bar{l} \bmod N_{S S B}^{Q C L}\right) \). The UE assumes that within a discovery burst transmission window, a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks on a serving cell is not larger than \( N_{S S B}^{Q C L} \) and a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks with a same SS/PBCH block index is not larger than one.

\hline subCarrierSpacingCommon & \( N_{\text {SSR }}^{\text {QCL }} \) \\

\end{table}

For operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, a UE expects a MIB in a SS/PBCH block to provide subCarrierSpacingCommon \( = \) 'scs30or120'.

Upon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if \( k_{S S B}<24 \) [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if \( k_{S S B}<12 \) for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if \( k_{S S B}>23 \) for FR1 or if \( k_{S S B}>11 \) for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon.

For a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, or on an SCell if applicable as described in [10, TS 38.133], of the cell group for the serving cell.
