If a UE receives a first DCI format that the UE detects in a first PDCCH monitoring occasion and includes a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field providing an inapplicable value from \( d l \)-DataToUL-ACK-r16,
- if the UE detects a second DCI format, the UE multiplexes the corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in a slot that is indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format, where
- if the UE is not provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16, the UE detects the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one, and where the slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-toHARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
- if the UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16, the UE detects the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one, and the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK information report for a same PDSCH group index as indicated by the first DCI format as described in clause 9.1.3.3, and where the slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
- if the UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16, the UE receives the second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format, and the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK information report for a same PDSCH group index as indicated by the first DCI format as described in clause 9.1.3.3.
- if the UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback, the first DCI format does not have associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception or TCI state update, the UE detects the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one, and the second DCI format includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1, the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4, and where the slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
- if the UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback-r16, the first DCI format does not have associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception or TCI state update, and the UE receives the second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format, and the second DCI format includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1, the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4.
- otherwise, the UE does not multiplex the corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission.
9.1.3.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

If a UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for multicast DCI formats with CRC scrambled by one or more G-RNTIs that the UE generates a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook, the UE separately applies the procedures in this clause per G-RNTI and determines the Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook by concatenating the Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook for unicast DCI formats followed by the HARQ-ACK codebooks for the multicast DCI formats in ascending order of the corresponding G-RNTI values.

A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions, or having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception, on an active DL BWP of a serving cell \( c \), as described in clause 10.1, and for which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in slot \( n \) based on
- PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values, or a dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-ForDCI-Formatl-2 value if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field is not present in a DCI format, for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \), as described in clause 9.2.3, in response to PDSCH receptions, or in response to a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling PDSCH reception
