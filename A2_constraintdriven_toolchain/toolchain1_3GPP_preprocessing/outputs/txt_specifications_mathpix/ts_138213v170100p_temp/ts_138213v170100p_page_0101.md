If the \( p d s c h-H A R Q-A C K-r e t x \) or \( p d s c h-H A R Q-A C K-r e t x D C I-1-2 \) field value in the DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \), respectively, is ' 1 ', the UE determines slot \( m \) as \( m=n-l \) where \( l \) is determined by a one-to-one mapping in ascending order among the values of the MCS field in the DCI format 1_1 or 1_2 and the values from -7 to 24 .

If the DCI format 1_1 or \( 1 \_2 \) includes a priority indicator field having a value, a priority value of first HARQ-ACK information in the first HARQ-ACK codebook is same as the value of the priority indicator field; otherwise, the priority value of the first HARQ-ACK information is zero.

If the UE would also multiplex in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \) a second HARQ-ACK codebook with second HARQ-ACK information of same priority value as for the first HARQ-ACK information in the first HARQ-ACK codebook, the UE appends the first HARQ-ACK codebook to the second HARQ-ACK codebook. The UE determines to multiplex the second HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \) as described in clause 9.2.3.

If in slot \( m \) the UE performs a procedure for deferring first HARQ-ACK information for SPS PDSCH receptions, as described in clause 9.2.5.4, and the first HARQ-ACK information has same priority value as a priority value indicated by the DCI format triggering the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \), the UE multiplexes in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \) second HARQ-ACK information with the priority value that results in slot \( n+k \) according to the procedure in this clause, by appending the first HARQ-ACK information to the second HARQ-ACK information. If the UE would also multiplex in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \) third HARQ-ACK information with the priority value, the UE appends the second HARQ-ACK information followed by the first HARQ-ACK information to the third HARQ-ACK information. The UE determines to multiplex the third HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+ k \) as described in clause 9.2.3.

If in slot \( m \) the UE would transmit a first PUCCH with first HARQ-ACK information over more than one slot and a second PUCCH with second HARQ-ACK information over one or more slots, where the first and second HARQ-ACK information have same priority value, the UE multiplexes in the PUCCH transmission in slot \( n+k \) one of
- the first HARQ-ACK information if the first PUCCH starts at an earlier slot than the second PUCCH, or
- the second HARQ-ACK information if the second PUCCH starts at an earlier slot than the first PUCCH.
9.2 UCI reporting in physical uplink control channel

UCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and CSI. UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1. For the remaining of this clause, any reference to \( S R \) is applicable for \( S R \) and/or for \( L R R \).

A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode \( = \) separate, at least one of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.

If a UE is provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate, the UE may transmit up to two PUCCHs with HARQ-ACK information in different symbols within a slot.

In clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a number of respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360 ; otherwise, the UE determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective UCI bits as described in [5, TS 38.212].
9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets

If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet in PUCCH-Config, a PUCCH resource set is provided by pucch-ResourceCommon through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of \( N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }} \) PRBs. For operation in FR2-2, pucch-ResourceCommon can also provide a number of \( N_{R B} \) RBs for the PUCCH resource set; otherwise \( N_{R B}=1 \).

The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset \( R B_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {offset }} \), and a cyclic shift index set for a PUCCH transmission.

The UE transmits a PUCCH using frequency hopping if not provided uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWPUplinkCommon; otherwise, the UE transmits a PUCCH without frequency hopping.
