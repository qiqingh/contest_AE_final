For DCI format 3_0, if present, the PSFCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values map to values for a set of number of slots provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH as defined in Table 16.5-2.

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions and for a number of PSFCH reception occasions ending in slot \( n \), the UE provides the generated HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot \( n+k \), subject to the overlapping conditions in clause 9.2.5, where \( k \) is a number of slots indicated by a PSFCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format indicating a slot for PUCCH transmission to report the HARQ-ACK information, or \( k \) is provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH for a transmission scheduled by a DCI format or for a SL configured grant type 2, or by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel for a SL configured grant type 1. \( k=0 \) corresponds to a last slot for a PUCCH transmission that would overlap with the last PSFCH reception occasion assuming that the start of the sidelink frame is same as the start of the downlink frame [4, TS 38.211].

For a PSSCH transmission by a UE that is scheduled by a DCI format, or for a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission activated by a DCI format, the DCI format indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, the DCI format activating the SL configured grant Type 2 indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 1 PSSCH transmission, a PUCCH resource can be provided by sl-NIPUCCH-AN and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Typel. For transmission of HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, a UE can be provided a PUCCH resource by sl-NIPUCCH-AN-Type2. If a PUCCH resource is not provided, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH with generated HARQ-ACK information from PSFCH reception occasions.

For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources from up to four PUCCH resource sets provided by sl-PUCCH-Config, for \( O_{U C I} \) HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212] in a last DCI format 3_0, among the DCI formats \( 3 \_0 \) that have a value of a PSFCH-toHARQ_feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes.

The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as described in clause 9.2.3.

A UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 or PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 as described in clause 9.2.3.

A UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information for more than one SL configured grants in a same PUCCH.

A priority value of a PUCCH transmission with one or more sidelink HARQ-ACK information bits is the smallest priority value for the one or more HARQ-ACK information bits.

In the following, the CRC for DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) is scrambled with a SL-RNTI or a SL-CS-RNTI.
16.5.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination

This clause applies if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook \( = \) semi-static.
