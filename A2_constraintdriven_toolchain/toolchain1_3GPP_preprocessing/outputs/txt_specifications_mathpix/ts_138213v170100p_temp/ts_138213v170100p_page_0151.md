- per set of spans on the active DL BWP(s) of all scheduling cell(s) from the \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16}^{\mathrm{DL}(\mathrm{X}, \mu} \) downlink cells within every X symbols, if the union of PDCCH monitoring occasions on all scheduling cells from the \( N_{\text {cells }, \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL}(\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}) \mu} \) downlink cells results to PDCCH monitoring according to the combination (X, Y) and any pair of spans in the set is within \( Y \) symbols, where first X symbols start at a first symbol with a PDCCH monitoring occasion and next X symbols start at a first symbol with a PDCCH monitoring occasion that is not included in the first \( X \) symbols
- per set of spans across the active DL BWP(s) of all scheduling cells from the \( N_{\text {cells, } r 16}^{\mathrm{DL}(\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}), \mu} \) downlink cells, with at most one span per scheduling cell for each set of spans, otherwise
where \( N_{\mathrm{cells}, \mathrm{r} 16}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mathrm{j}} \) is a number of configured cells with associated PDCCH candidates monitored in the active DL BWPs of the scheduling cells using SCS configuration \( j \). If a UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided both monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r 15 monitoringcapability and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r16monitoringcapability, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells, r16 }}^{\text {cap-r16 }} \).

For each scheduled cell from the \( N_{\text {cells }, r 16}^{\mathrm{DL}(\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}), \mu} \) downlink cells using combination \( (\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}) \), the UE is not required to monitor on the active DL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \) of the scheduling cell, more than \( \min \left(M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max \left(X_{Y}, \mu\right.}, M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\operatorname{total}\left(X_{Y}, \mu\right), \mu}\right) \) PDCCH candidates or more than \( \min \left(C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max (X, Y), \mu}, C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }(X, Y), \mu}\right) \) non-overlapped CCEs per span.

A UE does not expect to be configured CSS sets, except for CSS sets provided by searchSpaceBroadcast or by searchSpace-Multicast, that result to corresponding total, or per scheduled cell, numbers of monitored PDCCH candidates and non-overlapped CCEs per slot, per group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \), or per span that exceed the corresponding maximum numbers per slot, or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \), or per span, respectively.

For same cell scheduling or for cross-carrier scheduling, a UE does not expect a number of PDCCH candidates, and a number of corresponding non-overlapped CCEs per slot, or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination ( \( X_{s}, Y_{s} \) ), or per span, on a secondary cell to be larger than the corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of monitoring on the secondary cell per slot, or per group of \( X_{s} \) slots for a corresponding combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \), or per span, respectively. If a UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) rl6monitoringcapability for the primary cell, except the first span of each slot, the UE does not expect a number of PDCCH candidates and a number of corresponding nonoverlapped CCEs per span on the primary cell to be larger than the corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of monitoring on the primary cell per span.

If a UE is configured with \( N_{\text {cells, } 17}^{\mathrm{DL} \mu} \) downlink cells with SCS configuration \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \) in the active DL BWPS of the scheduling cells, and with \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, X_{S}, \mu} \) of the \( N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells using any combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \) for a group of \( X_{s} \) slots for PDCCH monitoring, where \( \sum_{\mu=5}^{6} N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \leq N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), the UE is not required to monitor, on the active DL BWP of the scheduling cell, more than \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, X_{S}, \mu}=M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{S}, \mu} \mathrm{PDCCH} \) candidates or more than \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, X_{S}, \mu}=C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\max , X_{S}, \mu} \) non-overlapped CCEs per group of \( X_{s} \) slots for each scheduled cell when the scheduling cell is from the \( N_{\text {cells, } 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, X_{s}} \) downlink cells. If the UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability and downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = r17monitoringcapability for the active DL BWPs, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells,r17/r15. }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \). If the UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig = rl6monitoringcapability and downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( =r 17 \) monitoringcapability for the active DL BWPs, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap }-17} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells,r17/r16 }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \). If the UE is configured with downlink cells for which the UE is provided monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r15monitoringcapability and monitoringCapabilityConfig \( = \) r16monitoringcapability and downlink cells with SCS configuration \( \mu \in\{5,6\} \) for the active DL BWPs, \( N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \) is replaced by \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17 /\{\mathrm{r} 15, \mathrm{r} 16\}}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \).

If a UE is configured \( N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells with monitoringCapabilityConfig \( =r 17 \) monitoringcapability for the active DL BWPs of the scheduling cells, and with \( N_{\text {cells, } \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL} X_{\mathrm{S}}, \mu} \) of the \( N_{\text {cells, } 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu} \) downlink cells using any combination \( \left(X_{s}, Y_{s}\right) \) for a group of \( X_{s} \) slots for PDCCH monitoring, where \( \sum_{\mu=5}^{6} N_{\text {cell } \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r} 17}^{\mathrm{DL}, \mu}>N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \), a DL BWP of an activated cell is the active DL BWP of the activated cell, and a DL BWP of a deactivated cell is the DL BWP with index provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id for the deactivated cell, the UE is not required to monitor more than \( M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total }, X_{S}, \mu}= \left\lfloor N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \cdot M_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } X_{S}, \mu} \cdot N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}_{1} X_{S}, \mu} / \sum_{j=5}^{6} N_{\text {cells, } r 17}^{\mathrm{DL}_{1} j}\right\rfloor \) PDCCH candidates, or more than \( C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {total, } X_{S}, \mu}=\left\lfloor N_{\text {cells }}^{\text {cap-r17 }} \cdot C_{\text {PDCCH }}^{\text {max, } X_{S}, \mu}\right. \). \( N_{\text {cells }, \text { 17 }}^{\mathrm{DL}_{,} X_{s}, \mu} / \sum_{j=5}^{6} N_{\text {cells }, \text { 17 } 7}^{\mathrm{DL}_{, j}} \) ] non-overlapped CCEs, per group of \( X_{s} \) slots on the active DL BWP(s) of scheduling cell(s)
