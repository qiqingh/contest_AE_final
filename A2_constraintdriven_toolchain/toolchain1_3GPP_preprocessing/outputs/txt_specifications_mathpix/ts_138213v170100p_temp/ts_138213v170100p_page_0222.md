3GPP TS 38.213 version 17.1.0 Release 17

ETSI TS 138213 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

A UE that transmits a PSCCH with SCI format 1-A using sidelink resource allocation mode 2 [6, TS 38.214] sets
- "Resource reservation period" as an index in sl-ResourceReservePeriodList corresponding to a reservation period provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], if the UE is provided sl-MultiReserveResource
- the values of the frequency resource assignment field and the time resource assignment field as described in [6, TS 38.214] to indicate \( N \) resources from a set \( \left\{R_{\mathrm{y}}\right\} \) of resources selected by higher layers as described in [11, TS 38.321] with \( N \) smallest slot indices \( y_{i} \) for \( 0 \leq i \leq N-1 \) such that \( y_{0}<y_{1}<\cdots<y_{N-1} \leq y_{0}+31 \), where:
- \( \quad N=\min \left(N_{\text {selected }}, N_{\text {max_reserve }}\right) \), where \( N_{\text {selected }} \) is a number of resources in the set \( \left\{R_{\mathrm{y}}\right\} \) with slot indices \( y_{j}, 0 \leq j \leq N_{\text {selected }}-1 \), such that \( y_{0}<y_{1}<\cdots<y_{N_{\text {selected }}-1} \leq y_{0}+31 \), and \( N_{\text {max_reserve }} \) is provided by sl-MaxNumPerReserve
- each resource, from the set of \( \left\{R_{\mathrm{y}}\right\} \) resources, corresponds to \( L_{\text {subcH }} \) contiguous sub-channels and a slot in a set of slots \( \left\{t_{y}^{\prime S L}\right\} \), where \( L_{\text {subCH }} \) is the number of sub-channels available for PSSCH/PSCCH transmission in a slot
- \( \left(t_{0}^{S L}, t_{1}^{S L}, t_{2}^{S L}, \ldots\right) \) is a set of slots in a sidelink resource pool \( [6 \), TS 38.214]
- \( y_{0} \) is an index of a slot where the PSCCH with SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) is transmitted.

A UE that transmits a PSCCH with SCI format 1-A using sidelink resource allocation mode 1 [6, TS 38.214] sets
- the values of the frequency resource assignment field and the time resource assignment field for the SCI format 1-A transmitted in the \( m \)-th resource for PSCCH/PSSCH transmission provided by a dynamic grant or by a SL configured grant, where \( m=\{1, \ldots, M\} \) and M is the total number of resources for \( \mathrm{PSCCH} / \mathrm{PSSCH} \) transmission provided by a dynamic grant or the number of resources for PSCCH/PSSCH transmission in a period provided by a SL configured grant type 1 or SL configured grant type 2, as follows:
- the frequency resource assignment field and time resource assignment field indicate the \( m \)-th to \( M \)-th resources as described in [6, TS 38.214].

For decoding of a SCI format 1 -A, a UE may assume that a number of bits provided by sl-NumReservedBits can have any value.
16.5 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK on uplink

A UE can be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources [12, TS 38.331] to report HARQ-ACK information that the UE generates based on HARQ-ACK information that the UE obtains from PSFCH receptions, or from absence of PSFCH receptions. The UE reports HARQ-ACK information on the primary cell of the PUCCH group, as described in clause 9, of the cell where the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of DCI format 3_0.

For SL configured grant Type 1 or Type 2 PSSCH transmissions by a UE within a time period provided by slPeriodCG, the UE generates one HARQ-ACK information bit in response to the PSFCH receptions to multiplex in a PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time resource, in a set of time resources.

For PSSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI format 3_0, a UE generates HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH receptions to multiplex in a PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time resource in a set of time resources provided by the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \).

From a number of PSFCH reception occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission. The UE can be indicated by a SCI format to perform one of the following and the UE constructs a HARQ-ACK codeword with HARQ-ACK information, when applicable
- for one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of " 10 "
- generate HARQ-ACK information with same value as a value of HARQ-ACK information the UE determines from the last PSFCH reception from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions or, if the UE determines that a PSFCH is not received at the last PSFCH reception occasion and ACK is not received in any of previous PSFCH reception occasions, generate NACK
