19.2 Random-access based PUSCH transmission

A UE indicated to release a dedicated RRC connection can be provided a configuration for a Type-1 and/or a Type-2 random access procedure on the initial UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]. PRACH occasions can have either a common configuration as, or a separate configuration from, PRACH occasions for Type-1 or Type-2 random access procedure as described in clause 8.1. The UE procedure is as described in clause 8, including clauses 8.1 through 8.4. The UE transmits a PRACH preamble with a power determined as described in clause 7.4.

For a common configuration of PRACH occasions and a Type-1 or a Type-2 random access procedure, a UE can be provided a number of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by sdt-CB-PreamblesPerSSBPerSharedRO or sdt-msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO, respectively. A PRACH transmission can be on a subset of PRACH occasions associated with a same SS/PBCH block index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle as determined by a PRACH mask index provided by sdt-SSB-SharedRO-Masklndex or sdt-msgA-SSB-SharedROMaskIndex according to [11, TS 38.321].

A UE can be provided by sdt-SearchSpace a CSS set to monitor, after contention resolution as described in clause 8.4, PDCCH for detection of a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI for scheduling respective PUSCH transmissions or PDSCH receptions; otherwise, if the UE is not provided sdt-SearchSpace, the UE monitors PDCCH according to a Type1-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 10.1. The UE may assume that the DMRS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions, the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDSCH receptions, and the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi co-location 'typeA' or 'typeD' properties.
