- second value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest p0-PUSCH-SetID value in p0-PUSCH-SetList and second value in P0-PUSCH-Set with the lowest p0-PUSCH-SetID in p0-PUSCH-SetList2, respectively, if the open-loop power control parameter set indication value is ' 10 ' or ' 11 '
- else, the UE determines first and second values \( P_{0 \_ \text {UE } \_ \text {PUSCH }, b, f, c}(j) \) from the value of the first and second P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet in p0-AlphaSets, respectively
- For \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \)

- For \( j=1 \),
- If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and is provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes an SRS resource set indicator field, and for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell
- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 00 , first \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(1) \) value is provided by \( p 0-P U S C H- \) Alpha in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 01 , first \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(1) \) value is provided by p0-PUSCH-Alpha 2 in ConfiguredGrantConfig.
- If the SRS resource set indicator value is 10 or 11 , first and second \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(1) \) values are respectively provided by p0-PUSCH-Alpha and p0-PUSCH-Alpha 2 in ConfiguredGrantConfig-
- else \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(1) \) is provided by alpha obtained from p0-PUSCH-Alpha in ConfiguredGrantConfig providing an index P0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld to a set of P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet, or by alpha for a PUSCH (re)transmission as described in clause 19.1, for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- For \( j \in S_{J} \), a set of \( \alpha_{b_{, f, c}}(j) \) values are provided by a set of alpha in P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet indicated by a respective set of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld for active UL BWP \( b \) of carrier \( f \) of serving cell \( c \)
- If the UE is provided SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl and more than one values of p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld in p0-AlphaSets,
- if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'codebook', the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for
- the two SRI fields and a set of indexes provided by P0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines first and second values of \( \alpha_{b, f, c}(j) \) from the P0-PUSCHAlphaSetID values that are mapped to the values of the first and second SRI field values, respectively.
- if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission includes two SRI fields and the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with usage set to 'nonCodebook', the UE obtains a mapping from sri-PUSCH-PowerControlld in SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl between a set of values for
- the first SRI field and a set of indexes provided by P0-PUSCH-AlphaSetld that map to P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet values, and determines first value of \( \alpha_{b_{1}, c}(j) \) from the P0-PUSCH-AlphaSetID value that is mapped to the first SRI field value, and
