If the UE detects a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI and receives a transport block within the window in a corresponding PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \).

The UE does not expect to be indicated to transmit the PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information at a time that is prior to a time when the UE applies a TA command that is provided by the transport block. If the UE does not detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit only PRACH according to Type-1 random access procedure or to transmit both PRACH and PUSCH according to Type-2 random access procedure [11, TS 38.321]. If requested by higher layers, the UE is expected to transmit a PRACH no later than \( N_{\mathrm{T}, 1}+0.75 \mathrm{msec} \) after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where \( N_{\mathrm{T}, 1} \) is a time duration of \( N_{1} \) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For \( \mu=0 \), the UE assumes \( N_{1,0}= \) 14 [6, TS 38.214].

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH using same SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1 0, if applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or the UE does not correctly receive a corresponding transport block within the window, the UE procedure is as described in [11, TS 38.321].
8.3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant

An active UL BWP with SCS configuration \( \mu \), as described in clause 12 and in [4, TS 38.211], for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant is indicated by higher layers.

If useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH is not provided by BWP-UplinkCommon and BWP-UplinkDedicated, for determining the frequency domain resource allocation for the PUSCH transmission within the active UL BWP
- if the active UL BWP and the initial UL BWP have same SCS and same CP length and the active UL BWP includes all RBs of the initial UL BWP, or the active UL BWP is the initial UL BWP, the initial UL BWP is used
- else, the RB numbering starts from the first RB of the active UL BWP and the maximum number of RBs for frequency domain resource allocation equals the number of RBs in the initial UL BWP

The frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource allocation type 1 [6, TS 38.214]. For an initial UL BWP size of \( N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }} \) RBs, a UE processes the frequency domain resource assignment field as follows
- if \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }} \leq 180 \), or for operation with shared spectrum channel access if \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }} \leq 90 \)
- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to its \( \left\lceil\log _{2}\left(N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }} \cdot\left(N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }}+1\right) / 2\right)\right\rceil \) least significant bits and interpret the truncated frequency resource assignment field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0_0 as described in [5, TS 38.212]
- else
- insert \( \left[\log _{2}\left(N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }} \cdot\left(N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }}+1\right) / 2\right)\right]-14 \) most significant bits, or for operation with shared spectrum channel access insert \( \left\lceil\log _{2}\left(N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }} \cdot\left(N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }}+1\right) / 2\right)\right\rceil-12 \) most significant bits, with value set to ' 0 ' after the \( N_{\text {UL hop }} \) bits to the frequency domain resource assignment field, where \( N_{\text {ULhop }}=0 \) if the frequency hopping flag is set to ' 0 ' and \( N_{\mathrm{UL}, \mathrm{h} \mathrm{p}} \) is provided in Table 8.3-1 if the hopping flag bit is set to ' 1 ', and interpret the expanded frequency resource assignment field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) as described in [5, TS 38.212]
