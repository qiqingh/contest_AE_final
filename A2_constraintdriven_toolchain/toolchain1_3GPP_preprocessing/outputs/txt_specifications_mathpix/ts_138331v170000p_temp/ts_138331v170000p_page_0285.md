\( 4> \) if \( s l \)-SyncPriority corresponding to the concerned frequency is set to gnss, and \( s l-N b A s S y n c \) is set to false:
\( 5> \) UEs of which SLSSID is 0 , and inCoverage, included in the MasterInformationBlockSidelink message received from this UE, is set to true, or of which SLSSID is 0 and SLSS is transmitted on slot(s) indicated by sl-SSB-TimeAllocation3, starting with the UE with the highest PSBCH-RSRP result (priority group 1);
\( 5> \) UES of which SLSSID is 0 and SLSS is not transmitted on slot(s) indicated by sl-SSBTimeAllocation3, and inCoverage, included in the MasterInformationBlockSidelink message received from this UE, is set to false, starting with the UE with the highest PSBCHS-RSRP result (priority group 2);
\( 5> \) UEs of which SLSSID is 337 and inCoverage, included in the MasterInformationBlockSidelink message received from this UE, is set to false, starting with the UE with the highest PSBCH-RSRP result (priority group 2);
\( 5> \) Other UEs, starting with the UE with the highest PSBCH-RSRP result (priority group 3);
NOTE: How the UE achieves subframe boundary alignment between V2X sidelink communication and NR sidelink communication (if both are performed by the UE) is as specified in TS 38.213, clause 16.7.
5.8.6.3 Sidelink communication transmission reference cell selection

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication shall:
\( 1> \) for the frequency used to transmit NR sidelink communication, select a cell to be used as reference for synchronization in accordance with the following:
\( 2> \) if the frequency concerns the primary frequency:
\( 3> \) use the PCell or the serving cell as reference;
\( 2> \) else if the frequency concerns a secondary frequency:
\( 3> \) use the concerned SCell as reference;
\( 2> \) else if the UE is in coverage of the concerned frequency:
\( 3> \) use the DL frequency paired with the one used to transmit NR sidelink communication as reference;
\( 2> \) else (i.e., out of coverage on the concerned frequency):
\( 3> \) use the PCell or the serving cell as reference, if needed;
5.8.7 Sidelink communication reception

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink communication shall:
\( 1> \) if the conditions for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in 5.8 .2 are met:
\( 2> \) if the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in \( s \)-FreqInfoToAddModList in RRCReconfiguration message or sl-FreqInfoList included in S/B12:
\( 3> \) if the UE is configured with \( s l \)-RxPool included in RRCReconfiguration message with reconfiguration WithSync (i.e. handover):

4 configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the pool of resources indicated by sl-RxPool;
\( 3> \) else if the cell chosen for NR sidelink communication provides S/B12:
