\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline HandoverPreparationinformation field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
as-Context \\
Local RAN context required by the target gNB or DU.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rm-Config \\
Local RAN context used mainly for RRM purposes.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceConfig \\
The radio resource configuration as used in the source cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ue-CapabilityRAT-List \\
The UE radio access related capabilities concerning RATs supported by the UE. A gNB that retrieves MRDC related capability containers ensures that the set of included MRDC containers is consistent w.r.t. the feature set related information.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ue-inactiveTime \\
Duration while UE has not received or transmitted any user data. Thus the timer is still running in case e.g., UE measures the neighbour cells for the HO purpose. Value s1 corresponds to 1 second, \( s 2 \) corresponds to 2 seconds and so on. Value \( m i n 1 \) corresponds to 1 minute, value \( m i n 1 s 20 \) corresponds to 1 minute and 20 seconds, value min 1 s 40 corresponds to 1 minute and 40 seconds and so on. Value \( h r 1 \) corresponds to 1 hour, \( h r 1 \mathrm{~min} 30 \) corresponds to 1 hour and 30 minutes and so on.

\hline AS-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rrcReconfiguration \\
Contains the RRCReconfiguration configuration as generated entirely by the MN.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceRB-SN-Config \\
Contains the IE RadioBearerConfig as generated entirely by the SN. This field is only used when the UE is configured with SN terminated RB(s).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceSCG-Configured \\
Value true indicates that the UE is configured with NR or EUTRA SCG in source configuration. The field is only used in NR-DC and NE-DC and is included only if the fields sourceSCG-NR-Config and sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config are absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config \\
Contains the current dedicated SCG configuration in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10] and generated entirely by the SN. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message can only include the field scg-Configuration. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceSCG-NR-Config \\
Contains the current dedicated SCG configuration in RRCReconfiguration message as generated entirely by the SN. In this version of the specification, the \\
RRCReconfiguration message can only include fields secondaryCellGroup and measConfig. This field is only used in NR-DC.
