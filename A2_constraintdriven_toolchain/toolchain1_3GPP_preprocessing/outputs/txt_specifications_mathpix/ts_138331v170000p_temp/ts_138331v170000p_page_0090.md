\( 1> \) for each sCellIndex value included in the sCellToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (SCell addition):
\( 2> \) add the SCell, corresponding to the sCelllndex, in accordance with the sCellConfigCommon and sCellConfigDedicated;
\( 2> \) if the sCellState is included:
\( 3> \) configure lower layers to consider the SCell to be in activated state;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) configure lower layers to consider the SCell to be in deactivated state;
\( 2> \) for each measld included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
\( 3> \) if SCells are not applicable for the associated measurement; and
\( 3> \) if the concerned SCell is included in cellsTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld:

4 remove the concerned SCell from cellsTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld;
\( 2> \) if the SCellConfig contains the goodServingCellEvaluationBFD:
\( 3> \) the UE may perform the evaluation of the good serving cell quality criterion for this serving cell as specified in 5.7.13.2.
\( 1> \) for each sCellIndex value included in the sCellToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration (SCell modification):
\( 2> \) modify the SCell configuration in accordance with the sCellConfigDedicated;
\( 2> \) if the sCellToAddModList was received in an RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync, or received in an RRCResume message, or received in an RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync embedded in an RRCResume message or embedded in an RRCReconfiguration message or embedded in an E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message or embedded in an E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume message:
\( 3> \) if the sCellState is included:
\( 4> \) configure lower layers to consider the SCell to be in activated state;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) configure lower layers to consider the SCell to be in deactivated state.
\( 2> \) if the SCellConfig contains the goodServingCellEvaluationBFD:
\( 3> \) the UE may perform the evaluation of the good serving cell quality criterion for this serving cell as specified in 5.7.13.2.
5.3.5.5.10 BH RLC channel release

The [AB-node shall:
\( 1> \) for each BH-RLC-ChannellD value included in the bh-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList that is part of the current [AB-node configuration within the same cell group (LCH release); or
\( 1> \) for each \( B H \)-RLC-ChannellD value that is to be released as the result of an SCG release according to 5.3.5.4:
\( 2> \) release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3;
\( 2> \) release the corresponding logical channel.
