\( 3> \) if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.9.4.3, is not empty: 4> set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate transmission of the MBSInterestIndication message;
\( 2> \) else:
3> if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.9.4.3, is different from \( m b s \)-FreqList included in the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication; or

3> if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBS broadcast frequencies compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers has changed since the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication:

4> set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate transmission of the MBSInterestIndication message;

NOTE: The UE may send MBS Interest Indication even when it is able to receive the MBS services it is interested in i.e. to avoid that the network allocates a configuration inhibiting MBS broadcast reception.

3> else if SIB20 is provided by the PCell:
4> if since the last time the UE transmitted the MBS Interest Indication, the UE connected to a PCell not broadcasting SIB20; or
\( 4> \) if the set of MBS broadcast services of interest determined in accordance with 5.9.4.4 is different from \( m b s \)-ServiceList included in the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication:
\( 5> \) set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate the transmission of MBSInterestIndication message.
5.9.4.3 MBS frequencies of interest determination

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) consider a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of interest if the following conditions are met:
\( 2> \) at least one MBS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via a broadcast MRB is ongoing or about to start; and

NOTE 1: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 38.300 [2] or TS 23.247 [67].
\( 2> \) for at least one of these MBS sessions SIB21 acquired from the PCell includes for the concerned frequency one or more MBS FSAIs as indicated in the USD for this session; and

NOTE 2: The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of interest even though NG-RAN may (temporarily) not employ a broadcast MRB for the concerned session, i.e. the UE does not verify if the session is indicated on MCCH.
\( 2> \) the supportedBandCombination the UE included in UE-NR-Capability contains at least one band combination including the set of MBS frequencies of interest (i.e. the UE is capable of simultaneously receiving broadcast MRBs on the set of MBS frequencies of interest);

NOTE 3: When evaluating whether the UE is capable of simultaneously receiving broadcast MRBs on the set of MBS frequencies of interest, the UE does not take into account the serving frequencies that it is currently configured with i.e. the UE only considers MBS frequencies it is interested to receive regardless of whether these can be received together with the current serving cells or not.
5.9.4.4 MBS services of interest determination

The UE shall:
1> consider an MBS service to be part of the MBS services of interest if the following conditions are met:
\( 2> \) the UE is receiving or interested to receive this service via a broadcast MRB; and
