\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PDSCH-ServingCellConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
codeBlockGroupTransmission \\
Enables and configures code-block-group (CBG) based transmission (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.1). Network does not configure for a UE both spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs and codeBlockGroupTransmission within the same cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkHARQ-FeedbackDisabled \\
Used to disable the DL HARQ feedback, sent in the uplink, per HARQ process ID. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to HARQ process ID 0 , the next bit to HARQ process ID 1 and so on. Bits corresponding to HARQ process IDs that are not configured shall be ignored. The bit(s) set to one identify HARQ processes with disabled DL HARQ feedback and the bit(s) set to zero identify HARQ processes with enabled DL HARQ feedback.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxMIMO-Layers \\
Indicates the maximum number of MIMO layers to be used for PDSCH in all BWPs of this serving cell. (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 5.4.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH \\
The number of HARQ processes to be used on the PDSCH of a serving cell. Value \( n 2 \) corresponds to 2 HARQ processes, value \( n 4 \) to 4 HARQ processes, and so on. If the field is absent, the UE uses 8 HARQ processes (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-CodeBlockGroupTransmissionList \\
A list of configurations for up to two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
processingTypeZEnabled \\
Enables configuration of advanced processing time capability 2 for PDSCH (see 38.214 [19], clause 5.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-Cell \\
The ID of the serving cell (of the same cell group) to use for PUCCH. If the field is absent, the UE sends the HARQ feedback on the PUCCH of the SpCell of this cell group, or on this serving cell if it is a PUCCH SCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
xOverhead \\
Accounts for overhead from CSI-RS, CORESET, etc. If the field is absent, the UE applies value xOh0 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.3.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline

\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Conditional Presence } & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Explanation } \\
\hline SCellAddOnly & \begin{tabular}{l} 
It is optionally present, Need S, for (non-PUCCH) SCells when adding a new SCell. The field is absent, Need M, when \\
reconfiguring SCells. The field is also absent for the SpCells as well as for a PUCCH SCell.

- PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList

The IE PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList contains one or more of such PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations. The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. The UE determines the bit width of the DCI field based on the number of entries in the PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. Value 0 in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
