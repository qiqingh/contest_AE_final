\hline UEInformationResponse-IEs field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
logMeasReport \\
This field is used to provide the measurement results stored by the UE associated to logged MDT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultidieEUTRA \\
EUTRA measurement results performed during RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultidieNR \\
NR measurement results performed during RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-ReportList \\
This field is used to provide the list of RA reports that is stored by the UE for the past upto maxRAReport-r16 number of successful random access procedures.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rlf-Report \\
This field is used to indicate the RLF report related contents.

\hline LogMeasReport field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absoluteTimeStamp \\
Indicates the absolute time when the logged measurement configuration logging is provided, as indicated by NR within absolute Time/nfo.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
anyCellSelectionDetected \\
This field is used to indicate the detection of any cell selection state, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. The UE sets this field when performing the logging of measurement results in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and there is no suitable cell or no acceptable cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
inDeviceCoexDetected \\
Indicates that measurement logging is suspended due to IDC problem detection.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultServingCell \\
This field refers to the log measurement results taken in the Serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfGoodSSB \\
Indicates the number of good beams (beams that are above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation, if configured by the network) associated to the cells within the R value range (which is configured by network for cell reselection) of the highest ranked cell as part of the beam level measurements. If the UE has no SSB of a neighbour cell whose measurement quantity is above the absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation or if the network has not configured the absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation, then the UE does not include numberOfGoodSSB for the corresponding neighbour cell. If the UE has no SSB of the serving cell whose measurement quantity is above the absThreshSSBlocksConsolidation or if the network has not configured the absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation, then the UE shall set the numberOfGoodSSB for the serving cell to one.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
relativeTimeStamp \\
Indicates the time of logging measurement results, measured relative to the absolute Time Stamp. Value in seconds.
