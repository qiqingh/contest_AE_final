\( 5> \) set the spCellld to the global cell identity of the PSCell;
4> set the raPurpose to include the purpose of triggering the random-access procedure;
4> set the ra-Information Common as specified in clause 5.7.10.5.
The UE may discard the random access report information, i.e release the UE variable VarRA-Report, 48 hours after the last successful random access procedure related information is added to the VarRA-Report.

NOTE 1: The UE does not \( \log \) the RA information in the RA report if the triggering event of the random access is consistent UL LBT on SpCell as specified in TS 38.321 [6].
5.7.10.5 RA information determination for RA report and RLF report

The UE shall set the content in ra-InformationCommon as follows:
\( 1> \) set the absoluteFrequencyPointA to indicate the absolute frequency of the reference resource block associated to the random-access resources used in the random-access procedure;
\( 1> \) set the locationAndBandwidth and subcarrierSpacing associated to the UL BWP of the random-access resources used in the random-access procedure;
\( 1> \) if contention based random-access resources are used in the random-access procedure:
\( 2> \) set the msgl-FrequencyStart associated to the 4 step random-access resources if used in the random-access procedure, and if its value is different from the value of msgA-RO-FrequencyStart if it is included in the raInformationCommon;
\( 2> \) set the msgl-FDM associated to the 4 step random-access resources if used in the random-access procedure, and if its value is different from the value of msgA-RO-FDMCFRA if it is included in the raInformation Common;
\( 2> \) if msgl-SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 4 step random-access resources used in the random-access procedure is available, and if its value is different from the value of msgA-SubcarrierSpacing if it is included in the ra-InformationCommon:

3> set the msg 1-SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 4 step random-access resources used in the randomaccess procedure;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the msgl-SCS-From-prach-ConfigurationIndex to the subcarrier spacing as derived from the prachConfigurationIndex used in the 4-step random-access procedure, and if its value is different from the value of msgA-SCS-From-prach-ConfigurationIndex if it is included in the ra-InformationCommon;
\( 2> \) set the msgA_RO-FrequencyStart and msgA-RO-FDM and msgA-SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 2 step random- access resources if used in the random-access procedure;
\( 2> \) if \( m s g A \)-SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 2 step random-access resources used in the random-access procedure is available:

3> set the msgA-SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 2 step random-access resources used in the randomaccess procedure;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the msgA-SCS-From-prach-ConfigurationIndex to the subcarrier spacing as derived from the msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex used in the 2-step random-access procedure;
\( 1> \) if contention free random-access resources are used in the random-access procedure:
\( 2> \) set the \( m s g \) l-FrequencyStartCFRA and \( m s g \) l-FDMCFRA associated to the 4 step random-access resources if used in the random-access procedure;
\( 2> \) if msg 1 -SubcarrierSpacing associated to the 4 step random-access resources used in the random-access procedure is available:
