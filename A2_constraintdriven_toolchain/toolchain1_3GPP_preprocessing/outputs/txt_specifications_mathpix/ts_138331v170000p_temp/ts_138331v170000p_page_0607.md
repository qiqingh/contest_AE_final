\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RMTC-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measDurationSymbols \\
Number of consecutive symbols for which the Physical Layer reports samples of RSSI (see TS 38.215 [9], clause 5.1.21). Value sym1 corresponds to one symbol, sym14or12 corresponds to 14 symbols of the reference numerology for NCP and 12 symbols for ECP, and so on. \\
If measDurationSymbols-v1700 is signalled, the UE ignores measDurationSymbols-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ref-SCS-CP \\
Indicates a reference subcarrier spacing and cyclic prefix to be used for RSSI measurements (see TS 38.215 [9]). Value kHz15 corresponds to 15kHz, kHz30 corresponds to 30 kHz , value \( \mathrm{kHz} 60-\mathrm{NCP} \) corresponds to 60 kHz using normal cyclic prefix (NCP), and kHz60-ECP corresponds to 60 kHz using extended cyclic prefix (ECP). \\
If ref-SCS-CP-v1700 is signalled, the UE ignores ref-SCS-CP-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtc-Bandwidth \\
Indicates the bandwidth for the RSSI measurement (see TS 38.215 [9], clause 5.1.21).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mitc-Frequency \\
Indicates the center frequency of the measured bandwidth (see TS 38.215 [9], clause 5.1.21).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtc-Periodicity \\
Indicates the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) periodicity (see TS 38.215 [9], clause 5.1.21).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtc-SubframeOffset \\
Indicates the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) subframe offset for this frequency (see TS 38.215 [9], clause 5.1.21). For inter-frequency measurements, this field is optional present and if it is not configured, the UE chooses a random value as \( m \) tc-SubframeOffset for measDurationSymbols which shall be selected to be between 0 and the configured \( m \) tc-Periodicity with equal probability.

\hline ReferenceSigna/Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility \\
CSI-RS resources to be used for CSI-RS based RRM measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-ConfigMobility \\
SSB configuration for mobility (nominal SSBs, timing configuration).
\end{tabular} \\

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell \\
If this field is set to true, UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the same frequency carrier as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. Hence, if the UE is configured with a serving cell for which (absoluteFrequencySSB, subcarrierSpacing) in ServingCellConfigCommon is equal to (ssbFrequency, ssbSubcarrierSpacing) in this MeasObjectNR, this field indicates whether the UE can utilize the timing of this serving cell to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. Otherwise, this field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that target frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deriveSSB-IndexFromCellinter \\
If this field is present, UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment between the reference serving cell indicated by ServCelllndex and all neighbour cells in this MeasObjectNR as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. This field also indicates that the UE can utilize the timing of the reference serving cell indicated by ServCelllndex to derive the index of SS block transmitted by all neighbour cells with same frequency as this MeasObjectNR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-ToMeasure \\
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.
