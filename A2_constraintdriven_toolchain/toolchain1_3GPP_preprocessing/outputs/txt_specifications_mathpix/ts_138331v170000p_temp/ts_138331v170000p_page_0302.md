\( 3> \) else (the \( s \) l-PagingInfo-RemoteUE is set to release):
4> stop monitoring the Paging message at the L2 U2N Remote UE's paging occasion;
\( 4> \) release the received paging information in sl-PagingInfo-RemoteUE;
\( 2> \) else (the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED on an active BWP without pagingSearchSpace configured):
\( 3> \) if the sl-PagingInfo-RemoteUE is set to setup:
4> include the received sl-PagingIdentity-RemoteUE in SidelinkUEInformationNR message and perform Sidelink UE information transmission in accordance with 5.8.3;
\( 3> \) else (the \( s \)-PagingInfo-RemoteUE is set to release):
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message to release the \( s \) /-PagingldentityRemoteUE in SidelinkUEInformationNR message in accordance with 5.8.3;
\( 4> \) release the received paging information in sl-PagingInfo-RemoteUE;
\( 1> \) if the RemoteUEInformationSidelink includes the \( s / \)-Requested-SI-List:

5.8.9.9 Uu message transfer in sidelink
5.8.9.9.1 General

Figure 5.8.9.9.1-1: Uu message transfer in sidelink

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer Paging message and System Information from the L2 U2N Relay UE to the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE.
5.8.9.9.2 Actions related to transmission of UuMessage TransferSidelink message

The L2 U2N Relay UE initiates the Uu message transfer procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
\( 1> \) upon receiving Paging message related to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE from network;
\( 1> \) upon acquisition of the SIBs requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE (as indicated in sl-Requested-SIList in the RemoteUEInformationSidelink);
\( 1> \) upon receiving the updated SIB1 and the SIBs have been requested by the connected L2 U2N Remote UE from network;

The L2 U2N Relay UE shall set the contents of UuMessageTransferSidelink message as follows:
