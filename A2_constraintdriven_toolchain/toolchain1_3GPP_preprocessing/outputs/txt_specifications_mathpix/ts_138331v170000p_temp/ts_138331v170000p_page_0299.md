5.8.9.5 Actions related to PC5-RRC connection release requested by upper layers or AS layer

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request the release of the PC5-RRC connection as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or when AS layer releases the the PC5-RRC connection. The UE shall not initiate the procedure for power saving purposes.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the PC5-RRC connection release for the specific destination is requested by upper layers, or initiated at the AS:
\( 2> \) discard the NR sidelink communication related configuration of this destination;
\( 2> \) release the DRBs of this destination if configured, in according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
\( 2> \) release the SRBs of this destination, in according to clause 5.8.9.1a.3;
\( 2> \) release the PC5 Relay RLC channels if configured, in according to clause 5.8.9.7.1;
\( 2> \) reset the sidelink specific MAC of this destination.
\( 2> \) consider the PC5-RRC connection is released for the destination;
\( 1> \) if the PC5-RRC connection release is initiated at the AS:
\( 2> \) indicate the upper layers the PC5-RRC connection is released for the destination;
5.8.9.6 UE assistance information Sidelink
5.8.9.6.1 General

Figure 5.8.9.6.1-1: UE assistance Information Sidelink

The purpose of this procedure is for a UE to inform its peer UE of the sidelink DRX assistance information used to determine the sidelink DRX configuration for unicast communication.

For sidelink unicast, a UE may include its desired sidelink DRX configuration in the UEAssistancelnformationSidelink as the sidelink DRX assistance information which is transmitted to its peer UE.

NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to determine its desired sidelink DRX configuration for unicast communication.
5.8.9.6.2 Initiation

For sidelink unicast, if both a RX UE and its peer TX UE for a direction of sidelink communication are capable of sidelink DRX , the RX UE that is interested in sending the sidelink DRX assistance information may send the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink as the sidelink DRX assistance information to its peer UE when the sidelink DRX assistance information has not been sent previously or when the previously transmitted sidelink DRX assistance information has changed.
