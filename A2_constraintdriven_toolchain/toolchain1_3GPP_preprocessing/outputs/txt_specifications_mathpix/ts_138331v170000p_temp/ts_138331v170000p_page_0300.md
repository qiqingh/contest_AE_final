5.8.9.6.3 Actions related to reception of UEAssistanceInformationSidelink message

For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1, it may report the sidelink DRX assistance information received within the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink from its peer UE to the network. For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 2 or is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or out of coverage, and has obtained the sidelink DRX assistance information from the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink transmitted from its peer UE, it may determine the sidelink DRX configuration SL-DRX-ConfigUC for its peer UE based on UE implementation.

NOTE: When UE determines the sidelink DRX configuration for its peer UE, it may take the sidelink DRX assistance information that is received from its peer UE into account.
5.8.9.7 PC5 Relay RLC channel management for L2 U2N relay
5.8.9.7.1 PC5 Relay RLC channel release

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) l-RLC-ChannellD-PC5 included in the received \( s \) l-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList-PC5 that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration:
\( 2> \) release the RLC entity and the corresponding logical channel associated with the sl-RLC-ChannellD-PC5;
5.8.9.7.2 PC5 Relay RLC channel addition/modification

Upon PC5-RRC connection is established between the L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Relay UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) apply RLC specified configuration of SL-RLC0 as specified in clause 9-1.1.4 and RLC default configuration of SL-RLC1 as specified in clause 9.2.4;

Upon reception of any message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0, the L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) apply RLC default configuration of SL-RLC1 as specified in clause 9.2.4;
For each sl-RLC-ChannellD-PC5 received in the sl-RLC-ChannelToAddModList-PC5 IE the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the current configuration contains a sidelink RLC bearer with the received sl-RLC-ChannellD-PC5:
\( 2> \) reconfigure the sidelink RLC entity or entities in accordance with the received \( s t-R L C \)-ConfigPC5;
\( 2> \) reconfigure the sidelink logical channel in accordance with the received sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfigPC5;
\( 1> \) else (a PC5 Relay RLC channel with the received \( s \) /-RLC-ChannelID-PC5 was not configured before):
\( 2> \) establish an sidelink RLC entity in accordance with the received \( s / \)-RLC-ConfigPC5;
\( 2> \) configure the sidelink MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance with the received \( s / \)-MACLogicalChannelConfigPC5.
