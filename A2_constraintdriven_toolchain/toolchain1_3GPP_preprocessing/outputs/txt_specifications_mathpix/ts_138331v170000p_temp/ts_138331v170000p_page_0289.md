system information (if any). For other cases, UEs apply the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in SidelinkPreconfigNR (if any). When UE performs state transition between above three cases, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in the new state, after acquisition of the new configurations. Before acquisition of the new configurations, UE continues applying the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in the old state.
5.8.9.1.2 Actions related to transmission of RRCReconfiguration Sidelink message

The UE shall set the contents of RRCReconfigurationSidelink message as follows:
\( 1> \) for each sidelink DRB that is to be released, according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1.1, due to configuration by \( s \) ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR or by upper layers:

2> set the SLRB-PC5-ConfigIndex included in the sirb-ConfigToReleaseList corresponding to the sidelink DRB;
1> for each sidelink DRB that is to be established or modified, according to clause 5.8.9.1a.2.1, due to receiving \( s \) ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12 or SidelinkPreconfigNR:
\( 2> \) set the SLRB-Config included in the strb-ConfigToAddModList, according to the received \( s \) RadioBearerConfig and \( s l \)-RLC-BearerConfig corresponding to the sidelink DRB;
\( 1> \) set the \( s \) /-MeasConfig as follows:
\( 2> \) If the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in slConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12:

3> if UE is in RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 4> \) set the \( s \)-MeasConfig according to stored NR sidelink measurement configuration information for this destination;

3> if UE is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE:
4> set the sl-MeasConfig according to stored NR sidelink measurement configuration received from SIB12;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) set the \( s \) /-MeasConfig according to the sl-MeasPreconfig in SidelinkPreconfigNR;
1> start timer T400 for the destination associated with the sidelink DRB;
\( 1> \) set the \( s \) l-CSI-RS-Config;
\( 1> \) set the \( s \) /-LatencyBoundCSI-Report,
NOTE 1: How to set the parameters included in sl-CSI-RS-Config and sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report is up to UE implementation.
\( 1> \) set the sl-DRX-ConfigUC-PC5 as follows:
\( 2> \) If the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in \( s \)-FreqInfoToAddModList in \( s \) ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12:

3> if UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1:
\( 4> \) set the sl-DRX-ConfigUC-PC5 according to stored NR sidelink DRX configuration information for this destination.

3> else if UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 2:

4 → UE determines the sidelink DRX configuration for unicast for the associated peer UE;
NOTE 2: If UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE or out of coverage, it is up to UE implementation to set the \( s \)-DRX-Config UC-PC5.
