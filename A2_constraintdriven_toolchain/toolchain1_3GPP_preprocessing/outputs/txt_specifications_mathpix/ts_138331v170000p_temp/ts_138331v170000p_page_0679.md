\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PhysicalCellGroupConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ackNackFeedbackMode \\
Indicates which among the joint and separate ACK/NACK feedback modes to use within a slot as specified in TS 38.213 [13] (clause 9).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bdFactorR \\
Parameter for determining and distributing the maximum numbers of BD/CCE for mPDCCH based mPDSCH transmission as specified in TS 38.213[13] Clause 10.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cs-RNTI \\
RNTI value for downlink SPS (see SPS-Config) and uplink configured grant (see ConfiguredGrantConfig).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkAssignmentindexDCI-0-2 \\
Indicates if "Downlink assignment index" is present or absent in DCI format \( 0 \_2 \). If the field "downlinkAssignmentindexDCI-0-2" is absent, then 0 bit for "Downlink assignment index" in DCI format \( 0 \_2 \). If the field "downlinkAssignment/ndexDCI-0-2" is present, then the bitwidth of "Downlink assignment index" in DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) is defined in the same was as that in DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkAssignmentindexDCI-1-2 \\
Configures the number of bits for "Downlink assignment index" in DCI format 1_2. If the field is absent, then 0 bit for "Downlink assignment index" in DCI format 1_2. Note that 1 bit and 2 bits are applied if only one serving cell is configured in the DL and the higher layer parameter pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook=dynamic. 4 bits is applied if more than one serving cell are configured in the DL and the higher layer parameter pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is set to dynamic (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH \\
Enables spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs. It is configured per cell group (i.e. for all the cells within the cell group) for PUCCH reporting of HARQ-ACK. It is only applicable when more than 4 layers are possible to schedule. When the field is absent, the spatial bundling of PUCCH HARQ ACKs for the primary PUCCH group is disabled (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2.1). If the field harq-ACK SpatialBundlingPUCCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup is present, harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH is only applied to primary PUCCH group. Network does not configure for a UE both spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs and codeBlockGroupTransmission within the same cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup \\
Indicates whether spatial bundling of PUCCH HARQ ACKs for the secondary PUCCH group is enabled or disabled. The field is only applicable when more than 4 layers are possible to schedule (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2.1). When the field is absent, the use of spatial bundling of PUCCH HARQ ACKs for the secondary PUCCH group is indicated by harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2.1. Network does not configure for a UE both spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs and codeBlockGroupTransmission within the same cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH \\
Enables spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs. It is configured per cell group (i.e. for all the cells within the cell group) for PUSCH reporting of HARQ-ACK. It is only applicable when more than 4 layers are possible to schedule. When the field is absent, the spatial bundling of PUSCH HARQ ACKs for the primary PUCCH group is disabled (see TS 38.213 [13], clauses 9.1.2.2 and 9.1.3.2). If the field harq-ACK SpatialBundlingPUSCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup is present, harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH is only applied to primary PUCCH group. Network does not configure for a UE both spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs and codeBlockGroupTransmission within the same cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup \\
Indicates whether spatial bundling of PUSCH HARQ ACKs for the secondary PUCCH group is enabled or disabled. The field is only applicable when more than 4 layers are possible to schedule (see TS 38.213 [13], clauses 9.1.2.2 and 9.1.3.2). When the field is absent, the use of spatial bundling of PUSCH HARQ ACKs for the secondary PUCCH group is indicated by harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH. See TS 38.213 [13], clauses 9.1.2.2 and 9.1.3.2. Network does not configure for a UE both spatial bundling of HARQ ACKs and codeBlockGroupTransmission within the same cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcs-C-RNTI \\
RNTI to indicate use of qam64LowSE for grant-based transmissions. When the mcs-C-RNTI is configured, RNTI scrambling of DCI CRC is used to choose the corresponding MCS table.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nfi-TotalDAI-included \\
Indicates whether the NFI and total DAI fields of the non-scheduled PDSCH group is included in the non-fallback DL grant DCI (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1). The network configures this only when enhanced dynamic codebook is configured (pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is set to enhancedDynamic).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrdc-PCmode-FR1 \\
Indicates the uplink power sharing mode that the UE uses in NR-DC in frequency range 1 (FR1) (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.6).
\end{tabular} \\
