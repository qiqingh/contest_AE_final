ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the procedure was not initiated due to beam failure of the PSCell while the SCG is deactivated:
\( 2> \) suspend SCG transmission for all SRBs, DRBs and, if any, BH RLC channels;
\( 2> \) reset SCG MAC;
1> stop T304 for the SCG, if running;
\( 1> \) stop conditional reconfiguration evaluation for CPC, if configured;
\( 1> \) if the UE is in (NG)EN-DC:
\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.13a.

1> else:
\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the SCGFailureInformation message in accordance with 5.7.3.5.
5.7.3.3 Failure type determination for (NG)EN-DC

The UE shall set the SCG failure type as follows:
1> if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message due to T310 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as t310-Expiry;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message due to T312 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as any value and set the failureType-v1610 as t312-Expiry;
\( 1> \) else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message to provide reconfiguration with sync failure information for an SCG:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as synchReconfigFailureSCG;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message to provide random access problem indication from SCG MAC:
\( 2> \) if the random access procedure was initiated for beam failure recovery:
3> set the failureType as randomAccessProblem and set the failureType-v1610 as beamFailureRecoveryFailure;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the failureType as randomAccessProblem;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message to provide indication from SCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as ric-MaxNumRetx;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message due to SRB3 integrity check failure:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as srb3-IntegrityFailure;
\( 1> \) else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailureInformationNR message due to Reconfiguration failure of NR RRC reconfiguration message:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as scg-reconfigFailure;
\( 1> \) else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailurelnformationNR message due to consistent uplink LBT failures:
