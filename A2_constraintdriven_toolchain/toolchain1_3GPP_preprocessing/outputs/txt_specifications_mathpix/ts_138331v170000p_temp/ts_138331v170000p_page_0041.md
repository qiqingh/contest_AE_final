5.2.2.2.2 SI change indication and PWS notification

A modification period is used, i.e updated SI message (other than SI message for ETWS, CMAS, positioning assistance data, satellite ephemeris, common TA parameters and epoch time) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for
