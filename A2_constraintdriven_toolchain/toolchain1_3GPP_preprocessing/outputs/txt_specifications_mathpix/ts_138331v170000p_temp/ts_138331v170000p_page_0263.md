thresholdPercentageT304 included in the successHO-Config received before executing the last reconfiguration with sync; or
\( 1> \) if the ratio between the value of the elapsed time of the timer T310 and the configured value of the timer T310, configured while the UE was connected to the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync, is greater than thresholdPercentageT310 included in the successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync; or

1> if the T312 associated to the measurement identity of the target cell was running at the time of initiating the execution of the reconfiguration with sync procedure and if the ratio between the value of the elapsed time of the timer T312 and the configured value of the timer T312, configured while the UE was connected to the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync, is greater than thresholdPercentageT312 included in the successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync; or
\( 1> \) if sourceDAPS-FailureReporting included in the successHO-Config before executing the last reconfiguration with sync is set to true and if the last executed handover was a DAPS handover and if an RLF occurred at the source PCell during the DAPS handover while T304 was running:
\( 2> \) store the successful handover information in VarSuccessHO-Report and determine the content in VarSuccessHO-Report as follows:
\( 3> \) clear the information included in VarSuccessHO-Report, if any;
\( 3> \) set the plmn-IdentityList to include the list of EPLMNs stored by the UE (i.e., includes the RPLMN);
\( 3> \) set the \( c-R N T I \) to the C-RNTI assigned by the target PCell of the handover;
\( 3> \) for the source PCell in which the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was applied:
\( 4> \) set the sourceCellID in sourceCelllnfo to the global cell identity and tracking area code of the source PCell;
\( 4> \) set the sourceCellMeas in sourceCellinfo to include the cell level RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR, of the source PCell based on the available SSB and CSI-RS measurements collected up to the moment the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message,
\( 4> \) set the rsIndexResults in sourceCellMeas to include all the available SSB and CSI-RS measurement quantities of the source PCell collected up to the moment the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message;

4 - if the last executed handover was a DAPS handover and if an RLF occurred at the source PCell during the DAPS handover while T304 was running:
\( 5> \) set the rlf-InSourceDAPS in sourceCelllnfo to true;
\( 3> \) for the target PCell indicated in the last applied RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync:
\( 4> \) set the targetCellID in targetCelllnfo to the global cell identity and tracking area code of the target PCell;
\( 4> \) set the targetCellMeas in targetCellinfo to include the cell level RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR, of the target PCell based on the available SSB and CSI-RS measurements collected up to the moment the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message;

4> set the rsIndexResults in targetCellMeas to include all the available SSB and CSI-RS measurement quantities of the target PCell collected up to the moment the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message;

4> if the last applied RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was included in the stored condRRCReconfig:
\( 5> \) set the timeSinceCHO-Reconfig to the time elapsed between the initiation of the execution of conditional reconfiguration for the target PCell and the reception of the last
