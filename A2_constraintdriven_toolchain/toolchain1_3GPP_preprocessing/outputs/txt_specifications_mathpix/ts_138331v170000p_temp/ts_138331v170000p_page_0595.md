\hline MeasidleConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absThreshSS-Blocks Consolidation \\
Threshold for consolidation of L1 measurements per RS index.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamMeasConfigIdle \\
Indicates the beam level measurement configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierFreq \\
Indicates the NR carrier frequency to be used for measurements during RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierFreqEUTRA \\
Indicates the E-UTRA carrier frequency to be used for measurements during RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell \\
This field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the neighbor frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyBandList \\
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR idlefinactive measurement parameters apply. The UE shall select the first listed band which it supports in the frequencyBandList field to represent the NR neighbour carrier frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
includeBeamMeasurements \\
Indicates whether or not the UE shall include beam measurements in the NR idle/inactive measurement results.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport \\
Max number of beam indices to include in the idle/inactive measurement result.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measCellListEUTRA \\
Indicates the list of E-UTRA cells which the UE is requested to measure and report for idlefinactive measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measCellListNR \\
Indicates the list of NR cells which the UE is requested to measure and report for idlefinactive measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measidleCarrierListEUTRA \\
Indicates the E-UTRA carriers to be measured during RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measidleCarrierListNR \\
Indicates the NR carriers to be measured during RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measidleDuration \\
Indicates the duration for performing idle/inactive measurements while in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. Value sec10 correspond to 10 seconds, value sec30 to 30 seconds and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage \\
Number of SS blocks to average for cell measurement derivation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
qualityThreshold \\
Indicates the quality thresholds for reporting the measured cells for idle/inactive NR measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
quality ThresholdEUTRA \\
Indicates the quality thresholds for reporting the measured cells for idle/inactive E-UTRA measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

Indicates which measurement quantities UE is requested to report in the idlefinactive measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

Indicates which E-UTRA measurement quantities the UE is requested to report in the idle/inactive measurement report.
