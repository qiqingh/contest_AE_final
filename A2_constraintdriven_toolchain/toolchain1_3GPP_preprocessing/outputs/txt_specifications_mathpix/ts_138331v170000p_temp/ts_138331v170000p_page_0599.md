\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RSSI-ResourceConfigCLI field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofPRBs \\
Allowed size of the measurement BW. Only multiples of 4 are allowed. The smallest configurable number is the minimum of 4 and the width of the active DL BWP. If the configured value is larger than the width of the active DL BWP, the UE shall assume that the actual CLI-RSSI resource bandwidth is within the active DL BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSymbols \\
Within a slot that is configured for CLI-RSSI measurement (see slotConfiguration), the UE measures the RSSI from startPosition to startPosition + nrofSymbols -1 . The configured CLI-RSSI resource does not exceed the slot boundary of the reference SCS. If the SCS of configured DL BWP(s) is larger than the reference SCS, network configures startPosition and nrofSymbols such that the configured CLI-RSSI resource not to exceed the slot boundary corresponding to the configured BWP SCS. If the reference SCS is larger than SCS of configured DL BWP(s), network ensures startPosition and nrofSymbols are integer multiple of reference SCS divided by configured BWP SCS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
refServCellindex \\
The index of the reference serving cell. Frequency reference point of the RSSI resource is subcarrier 0 of CRB0 of the reference serving cell. If this field is absent, the reference serving cell is PCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rssi-PeriodicityAndOffset \\
Periodicity and slot offset for this CLI-RSSI resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sil corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value s/2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rssi-SCS \\
Reference subcarrier spacing for CLI-RSSI measurement. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15,30 , or 60 kHz \\
FR2-1: 60 or 120 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz \\
UE performs CLI-RSSI measurement with the SCS of the active bandwidth part within the configured CLI-RSSI resource in the active BWP regardless of the reference SCS of the measurement resource.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startPosition \\
OFDM symbol location of the CLI-RSSI resource within a slot.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startPRB \\
Starting PRB index of the measurement bandwidth. For the case where the reference subcarrier spacing is smaller than subcarrier spacing of active DL BWP(s), network configures startPRB and nrofPRBs are as a multiple of active BW SCS divided by reference SCS.
