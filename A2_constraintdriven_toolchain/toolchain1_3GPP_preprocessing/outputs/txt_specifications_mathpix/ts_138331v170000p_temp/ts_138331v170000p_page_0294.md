\( 1> \) for groupcast and broadcast; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, if the sidelink DRB addition was trigggered due to the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, after receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the sidelink DRB addition was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR or indicated by upper layers:
\( 2> \) if an SDAP entity for NR sidelink communication associated with the destination and the cast type of the sidelink DRB does not exist:
\( 3> \) establish an SDAP entity for NR sidelink communication as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1_1;
\( 2> \) (re)configure the SDAP entity in accordance with the \( s l \)-SDAP-ConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-SDAP-Config received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, associated with the sidelink DRB;
\( 2> \) establish a PDCP entity for NR sidelink communication and configure it in accordance with the \( s /-P D C P \) ConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-PDCP-Config received in slConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, associated with the sidelink DRB;
\( 2> \) establish a RLC entity for NR sidelink communication and configure it in accordance with the \( s l-R L C- \) ConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-RLC-Config received in slConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, associated with sidelink DRB;
\( 2> \) if this procedure was due to the reception of a RRCReconfigurationSidelink message:
\( 3> \) configure the MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance with the \( s /-M A C \) LogicalChannelConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink associated with the sidelink DRB, and perform the sidelink UE information procedure in clause 5.8 .3 for unicast if need;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) configure the MAC entity with a logical channel associated with the sidelink DRB, by assigning a new logical channel identity, in accordance with the sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfig received in the slConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR.

NOTE 1: When a sidelink DRB addition is due to the configuration by RRCReconfigurationSidelink, it is up to UE implementation to select the sidelink DRB configuration as necessary transmitting parameters for the sidelink DRB, from the received sl-ConfigDedicatedNR (if in RRC_CONNECTED), SIB12 (if in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE), SidelinkPreconfigNR (if out of coverage) with the same RLC mode as the one configured in RRCReconfigurationSidelink.

For the sidelink DRB, whose sidelink DRB modification conditions are met as in clause 5.8.9.1a.2.1, the UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication shall:
\( 1> \) for groupcast and broadcast; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, if the sidelink DRB modification was triggered due to the reception of the
RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, after receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the sidelink DRB modification was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12 or
SidelinkPreconfigNR:
\( 2> \) reconfigure the SDAP entity of the sidelink DRB, in accordance with the \( s /-S D A P \) - \( C \) onfig \( P C 5 \) received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-SDAP-Config received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, if included;
\( 2> \) reconfigure the PDCP entity of the sidelink DRB, in accordance with the \( s /-P D C P \)-ConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-PDCP-Config received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, if included;
