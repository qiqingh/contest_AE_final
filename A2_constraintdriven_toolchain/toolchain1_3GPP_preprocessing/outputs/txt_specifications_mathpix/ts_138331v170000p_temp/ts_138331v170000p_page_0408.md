\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UEAssistanceInformation field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rim-MeasRelaxationState \\
Indicates the relaxation state of RLM measurements. Value true indicates that the UE performs relaxation of RLM measurements, and value false indicates that the UE does not perform relaxation of RLM measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rrm-MeasRelaxationFulfilment \\
Indicates whether the UE fulfils the relaxed measurement criterion for stationary UE in 5.7.4.4. Value true indicates that the UE fulfils the criterion, and value false indicates that the UE does not fulfil the criterion.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-QoS-Flowidentity \\
This identity uniquely identifies one sidelink QoS flow between the UE and the network in the scope of UE, which is unique for different destination and cast type.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-UE-AssistancelnformationNR \\
Indicates the traffic characteristic of sidelink logical channel(s), specified in the IE SL-TrafficPatterninfo, that are setup for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
starting-SFN \\
indicates gap starting SFN number of UE's preferred aperiodic MUSIM gap without leaving RRC_CONNECTED state
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
starting-subframe \\
indicates gap starting subframe number of UE's preferred aperiodic MUSIM gap without leaving RRC_CONNECTED state
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
type1 \\
Indicates the preferred amount of increment/decrement to the long DRX cycle length with respect to the current configuration. Value in number of milliseconds. Value ms 40 corresponds to 40 milliseconds, msMinus40 corresponds to -40 milliseconds and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ul-GapFR2-PatternPreference \\
Indicates the UE's preference on FR2 UL gap pattern.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
victimSystemType \\
Indicate the list of victim system types to which IDC interference is caused from NR when configured with UL CA. Value gps, glonass, bds, galileo and nav/C indicates the type of GNSS. Value wlan indicates WLAN and value bluetooth indicates Bluetooth.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline nonSDT-Data-Indication field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nonSDT-Dataindication \\
Informs the network about the arrival of data mapped to radio bearers not configured for SDT data during SDT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resumeCause \\
Provides the resume cause based on the information received from the upper layers.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-TrafficPatterninfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
messageSize \\
Indicates the maximum TB size based on the observed traffic pattern. The value refers to the index of TS 38.321 [3], table 6.1.3.1-2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timingOffset \\
This field indicates the estimated timing for a packet arrival in a sidelink logical channel. Specifically, the value indicates the timing offset with respect to subframe\#0 of SFN\#0 in milliseconds.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
trafficPeriodicity \\
This field indicates the estimated data arrival periodicity in a sidelink logical channel. Value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms , ms50 corresponds to 50 ms and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- UECapabilityEnquiry

The UECapabilityEnquiry message is used to request UE radio access capabilities for NR as well as for other RATs.
