Figure 5.7.10.1-1: UE information procedure

The UE information procedure is used by the network to request the UE to report information.
5.7.10.2 Initiation

The network initiates the procedure by sending the UEInformationRequest message. The network should initiate this procedure only after successful security activation.
5.7.10.3 Reception of the UEInformationRequest message

Upon receiving the UEInformationRequest message, the UE shall, only after successful security activation:
1> if the idleModeMeasurementReq is included in the UEInformationRequest and the UE has stored VarMeasIdleReport that contains measurement information concerning cells other than the PCell:
\( 2> \) set the measResultldleEUTRA in the UEInformationResponse message to the value of measReportIdleEUTRA in the VarMeasIdleReport, if available;
\( 2> \) set the measResultIdleNR in the UEInformationResponse message to the value of measReportIdleNR in the VarMeasIdleReport, if available;
\( 2> \) discard the VarMeasIdleReport upon successful delivery of the UEInformationResponse message confirmed by lower layers;
\( 1> \) if the logMeasReportReq is present and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport:

2 if VarLogMeasReport includes one or more logged measurement entries, set the contents of the logMeasReport in the UEInformationResponse message as follows:

3> include the absoluteTimeStamp and set it to the value of absoluteTimeInfo in the VarLogMeasReport;
3> include the traceReference and set it to the value of traceReference in the VarLogMeasReport;
\( 3> \) include the traceRecordingSessionRef and set it to the value of traceRecordingSessionRef in the VarLogMeasReport;
\( 3> \) include the tce-Id and set it to the value of tce-Id in the VarLogMeasReport;
3> include the logMeasInfoList and set it to include one or more entries from the VarLogMeasReport starting from the entries logged first, and for each entry of the logMeasInfoList that is included, include all information stored in the corresponding logMeasInfoList entry in VarLogMeasReport;

3> if the VarLogMeasReport includes one or more additional logged measurement entries that are not included in the logMeasInfoList within the UEInformationResponse message:
