\hline NR-DL-PRS-PDC-ResourceSet field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dl-PRS-ResourceBandwidth \\
This field specifies the number of PRBs allocated for all the DL-PRS Resource (allocated DL-PRS bandwidth) in multiples of 4 PRBs in this resource set. All DL-PRS Resources of the DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set have the same bandwidth. Integer value 1 corresponds to 24 PRBs, value 2 corresponds to 28 PRBs, value 3 corresponds to 32 PRBs and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
di-PRS-StartPRB \\
This field specifies the start PRB index defined as offset with respect to subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 for the DL-PRS Resource. All DL-PRS Resources of the DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set have the same value of dl-PRS-StartPRB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numSymbols \\
This field specifies the number of symbols per DL-PRS Resource within a slot.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityAndOffset \\
This field specifies the periodicity of DL-PRS allocation in slots and the slot offset with respect to SFN \#0 slot \#0 in the PCell where the DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set is configured (i.e., slot where the first DL-PRS Resource of DL-PRS-PDC Resource Set occurs).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
repetitionFactor \\
This field specifies how many times each DL-PRS Resource is repeated for a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. It is applied to all resources of the DL-PRS Resource Set. Enumerated values n2, n4, n6, n8, n16, n32 correspond to 2,4,6, 8, 16, 32 resource repetitions, respectively. If this field is absent, the value for dl-PRSResourceRepetitionFactor is 1 (i.e., no resource repetition).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeGap \\
This field specifies the offset in units of slots between two repeated instances of a DL-PRS Resource corresponding to the same DL-PRS Resource ID within a single instance of the DL-PRS Resource Set. The time duration spanned by one DL-PRS Resource Set containing repeated DL-PRS Resources should not exceed the periodicity configured by periodicityAndOffset. The field is mandatory present, if repetitionFactor is present. Otherwise, it is not present.

- \( \quad \) NR-NS-PmaxList

The IE NR-NS-PmaxList is used to configure a list of additionalPmax and additionalSpectrumEmission, as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15], table 6.2.3.1-1A, and TS 38.101-2 [39], table 6.2.3.1-2, for a given frequency band.
