Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
- The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
- ParentlE-WithEM

The IE ParentIE-WithEMis an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIEI-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.

The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIEI-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.
