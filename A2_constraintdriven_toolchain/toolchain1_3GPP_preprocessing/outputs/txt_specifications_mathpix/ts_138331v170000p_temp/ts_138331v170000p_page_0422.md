\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfPreamblesSentOnSSB \\
This field is used to indicate the total number of successive RA preambles that were transmitted on the corresponding SS/PBCH block.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
onDemandSISuccess \\
This field is set to true when the RA report entry is included because of either msg1 based on demand SI request or msg3 based on demand SI request and if the on-demand SI request is successful. This field is set to false when the RA report entry is included because of either msg1 based on demand SI request or msg3 based on demand SI request and if the on-demand SI request is not successful. Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
perRAAttemptinfoList \\
This field provides detailed information about a random access attempt.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
perRACSI-RSinfoList \\
This field provides detailed information about the successive random access attempts associated to the same CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
perRASSBInfoList \\
This field provides detailed information about the successive random access attempts associated to the same SS/PBCH block.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-informationCommon \\
This field is used to provide information on random access attempts. This field is mandatory present.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
raPurpose \\
This field is used to indicate the RA scenario for which the RA report entry is triggered. The RA accesses associated to Initial access from RRC_IDLE, RRC re-establishment procedure, transition from RRC-INACTIVE. The indicator beamFailureRecovery is used in case of successful beam failure recovery related RA procedure in the SpCell [3]. The indicator reconfigurationWithSync is used if the UE executes a reconfiguration with sync. The indicator ulUnSynchronized is used if the random access procedure is initiated in a SpCell by DL or UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED when the timeAlignmentTimer is not running in the PTAG or if the RA procedure is initiated in a serving cell by a PDCCH order [3]. The indicator schedulingRequestFailure is used in case of SR failures [3]. The indicator noPUCCHResourceAvailable is used when the UE has no valid SR PUCCH resources configured [3]. The indicator requestForOtherS/is used for MSG1 based on demand SI request. The indicator msg3RequestForOtherS/is used in case of MSG3 based SI request.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
spCellID \\
This field is used to indicate the CGI of the SpCell of the cell group associated to the SCell in which the associated random access procedure was performed. If the UE performs RA procedure on a SCell associated to the MCG, then this field is set to the CGI of the PCell and if the UE performs RA procedure on a SCell associated to the SCG, then this field is set to the CGI of the PSCell. Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-index \\
This field is used to indicate the SS/PBCH index of the SS/PBCH block corresponding to the random access attempt.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssbsForSI-Acquisition \\
This field indicates the SSB(s) (in the form of SSB index(es)) that the UE used to receive the requested SI message(s). The field is present if the purpose of the random access procedure was to request on-demand SI (i.e. if the raPurpose is set to requestForOtherSI or msg3RequestForOtherS). Otherwise, the field is absent.
