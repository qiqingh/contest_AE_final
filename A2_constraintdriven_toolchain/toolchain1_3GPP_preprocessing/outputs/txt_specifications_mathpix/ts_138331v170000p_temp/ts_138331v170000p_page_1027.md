\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-UE-SelectedConfigRP field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList \\
Indicates the mapping between PSSCH transmission parameter (such as MCS, PRB number, retransmission number, CR limit) sets by using the indexes of the configurations in sl-CBR-PSSCH-TxConfigList, CBR ranges by using the indexes to the entry of the CBR range configurations in s/-CBR-RangeConfigList, and priority ranges. It also indicates the default PSSCH transmission parameters to be used when CBR measurement results are not available, and MCS range for the MCS tables used in the resource pool. The field sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList-v1650 is present only when si-CBR-Priority TxConfigList-r16 is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-MaxNumPerReserve \\
Indicates the maximum number of reserved \( \mathrm{PSCCH} / \mathrm{PSSCH} \) resources that can be indicated by an SCI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-MultiReserveResource \\
Indicates if it is allowed to reserve a sidelink resource for an initial transmission of a TB by an SCI associated with a different TB, based on sensing and resource selection procedure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-ResourceReservePeriodList \\
Set of possible resource reservation period allowed in the resource pool in the unit of ms. Up to 16 values can be configured per resource pool. The value \( m s 0 \) is always configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-RS-ForSensing \\
Indicates whether DMRS of PSCCH or PSSCH is used for L1 RSRP measurement in the sensing operation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-SensingWindow \\
Parameter that indicates the start of the sensing window.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-SelectionWindowList \\
Parameter that determines the end of the selection window in the resource selection for a TB with respect to priority indicated in SCI. Value n 1 corresponds to \( 1 * 2^{\mu} \), value n 5 corresponds to \( 5^{\star} 2^{\mu} \), and so on, where \( \mu=0,1,2,3 \) refers to SCS \( 15,30,60,120 \mathrm{kHz} \) respectively.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-Thres-RSRP-List \\
Indicates a list of 64 thresholds, and the threshold should be selected based on the priority in the decoded SCI and the priority in the SCI to be transmitted. A resource is excluded if it is indicated or reserved by a decoded SCI and PSSCH/PSCCH RSRP in the associated data resource is above a threshold.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-PowerControl field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-MaxTransPower \\
Indicates the maximum value of the UE's sidelink transmission power on this resource pool. The unit is dBm.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH \\
Indicates alpha value for sidelink pathloss based power control for \( \mathrm{PSCCH} / \mathrm{PSSCH} \) when si-PO-PSSCH-PSCCH is configured. When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH \\
Indicates P0 value for sidelink pathloss based power control for PSCCH/PSSCH. If not configured, sidelink pathloss based power control is disabled for PSCCH/PSSCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
di-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH \\
Indicates alpha value for downlink pathloss based power control for \( \mathrm{PSCCH} / \mathrm{PSSCH} \) when dl-PO-PSSCH-PSCCH is configured. When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dI-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH \\
Indicates P0 value for downlink pathloss based power control for PSCCH/PSSCH. If not configured, downlink pathloss based power control is disabled for PSCCH/PSSCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
di-Alpha-PSFCH \\
Indicates alpha value for downlink pathloss based power control for PSFCH when dl-PO-PSFCH is configured. When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dI-P0-PSFCH \\
Indicates P0 value for downlink pathloss based power control for PSFCH. If not configured, downlink pathloss based power control is disabled for PSFCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
