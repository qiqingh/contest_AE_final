A UE capable of providing an indication of fulfilment of the RRM measurement relaxation criterion in connected mode may initiate the procedure upon change of its fulfilment status for RRM measurement relaxation criterion for connected mode.

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if configured to provide delay budget report:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistancelnformation message with delayBudgetReport since it was configured to provide delay budget report; or
\( 2> \) if the current delay budget is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including delayBudgetReport and timer T342 is not running:

3> start or restart timer T342 with the timer value set to the delayBudgetReportingProhibitTimer;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide a delay budget report;

1> if configured to provide overheating assistance information:
\( 2> \) if the overheating condition has been detected and T345 is not running; or
\( 2> \) if the current overheating assistance information is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including overheatingAssistance and timer T345 is not running:
\( 3> \) start timer T345 with the timer value set to the overheatingIndication ProhibitTimer;
3> initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide overheating assistance information;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide IDC assistance information:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with idc-Assistance since it was configured to provide IDC assistance information:
\( 3> \) if on one or more frequencies included in candidateServingFreqListNR, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself; or

3> if on one or more supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies included in candidateServingFreqListNR, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide IDC assistance information;
\( 2> \) else if the current IDC assistance information is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message:
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide IDC assistance information;

NOTE 1: The term "IDC problems" refers to interference issues applicable across several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots are affected.

NOTE 2: For the frequencies on which a serving cell or serving cells is configured that is activated, IDC problems consist of interference issues that the UE cannot solve by itself, during either active data exchange or upcoming data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.
For frequencies on which a SCell or SCells is configured that is deactivated, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that the activation of the SCell or SCells would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
For a non-serving frequency, reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that if the non-serving frequency or frequencies became a serving frequency or serving frequencies then this would result in interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference on DRX parameters of a cell group for power saving:
