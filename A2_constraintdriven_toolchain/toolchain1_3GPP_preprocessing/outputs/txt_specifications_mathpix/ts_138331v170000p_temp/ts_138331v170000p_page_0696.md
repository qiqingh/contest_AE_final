\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PUCCH-Resource, PUCCH-ResourceExt field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
format, formatExt \\
Selection of the PUCCH format (format 0-4) and format-specific parameters, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2. format0 and format1 are only allowed for a resource in a first PUCCH resource set. format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed for a resource in non-first PUCCH resource set. The network can only configure formatExt-v1610 when format is set to format 2 or format3. The network only configures format \( E x t \)-v17XX when format is set to format0, format1 or format4.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
interlace0 \\
This is the only interlace of interlaced PUCCH Format 0 and 1 and the first interlace for interlaced PUCCH Format 2 and 3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
interlace1 \\
A second interlace, in addition to interlace 0 , as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. For 15 KHz SCS, values \( \{0.9\} \) are applicable; for 30 Khz SCS, values \( \{0.4\} \) are applicable. For 15 kHz SCS, the values of interlace 1 shall satisfy interlace \( 1=\bmod ( \) interlace \( 0+\mathrm{X}, 10) \) where \( \mathrm{X}=1,-1 \), or 5 .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intraSlotFrequencyHopping \\
Enabling intra-slot frequency hopping, applicable for all types of PUCCH formats. For long PUCCH over multiple slots, the intra and inter slot frequency hopping cannot be enabled at the same time for a UE. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofPRBs \\
Indicates the number of PRBs used per PUCCH resource for the PUCCH format, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. This field is applicable for PUCCH format0, format1, and format4 in FR2-2. The supported values for format4 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15 and 16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
occ-Index \\
Indicates the orthogonal cover code index (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). This field is Applicable when uselnteriacePUCCH-Dedicated-r16 is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
occ-Length \\
Indicates the orthogonal cover code length (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). Applicable when use/nteriacePUCCH-Dedicated-r16 is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots \\
Configuration of PUCCH repetition factor per PUCCH resource with associated scheduling DCI corresponding to Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition. This field is applicable when Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition is enabled. For a PUCCH resource, if both the field pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots and the field nrofSlots are present, the field nrofSiots is ignored and apply the value of pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots corresponding to Rel-17 dynamic PUCCH repetition. If this field is absent in a PUCCH resource with associated scheduling DCI , the UE applies the value of field nrofSlots.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-Resourceld \\
Identifier of the PUCCH resource.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
secondHopPRB \\
Index of first PRB after frequency hopping of PUCCH. This value is applicable for intra-slot frequency hopping (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1) or inter-slot frequency hopping (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.6).
\end{tabular} \\

\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PUCCH-ResourceSet field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxPayloadSize \\
Maximum number of UCI information bits that the UE may transmit using this PUCCH resource set (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). In a PUCCH occurrence, the UE chooses the first of its PUCCH-ResourceSet which supports the number of bits that the UE wants to transmit. The field is absent in the first set (Set0) and in the last configured set since the UE derives the maximum number of UCI information bits as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. This field can take integer values that are multiples of 4.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourceList \\
PUCCH resources of format0 and format1 are only allowed in the first PUCCH resource set, i.e., in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSet/d \( =0 \). This set may contain between 1 and 32 resources. PUCCH resources of format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetld > 0. If present, these sets contain between 1 and 8 resources each. The UE chooses a PUCCH-Resource from this list as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3. Note that this list contains only a list of resource IDs. The actual resources are configured in PUCCH-Config.
