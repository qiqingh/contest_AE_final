10 Generic error handling
10.1 General

The generic error handling defined in the subsequent subclauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.

The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE;
- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved value.

The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
10.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) when receiving an RRC message on the \( \mathrm{BCCH}, \mathrm{CCCH} \) or PCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
\( 2> \) ignore the message.
NOTE: This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined as INTEGER ( 1 _11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
10.3 Field set to a not comprehended value

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
\( 1> \) if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
\( 2> \) if a default value is defined for this field:
\( 3> \) treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
\( 2> \) else if the concerned field is optional:
\( 3> \) treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with clause 10.4
10.4 Mandatory field missing

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e \( g \) because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
\( 2> \) if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH:
