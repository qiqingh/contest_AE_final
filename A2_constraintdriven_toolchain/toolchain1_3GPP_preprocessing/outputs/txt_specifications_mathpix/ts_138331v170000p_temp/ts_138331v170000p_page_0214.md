5.6 UE capabilities
5.6.1 UE capability transfer
5.6.1.1 General

This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE capability information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the network.

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer
5.6.1.2 Initiation

The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information. The network should retrieve UE capabilities only after AS security activation. Network does not forward UE capabilities that were retrieved before AS security activation to the CN.
5.6.1.3 Reception of the UECapabilityEnquiry by the UE

The UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityInformation message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to \( n r \) :
\( 2> \) include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-NRCapability and with the rat-Type set to \( n r \);
\( 2> \) include the supportedBandCombinationList, featureSets and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;

1> if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra-nr:
\( 2> \) if the UE supports (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC:
3> include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-MRDCCapability and with the rat-Type set to eutra-nr;

3> include the supportedBandCombinationList and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
\( 1> \) if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra:
\( 2> \) if the UE supports E-UTRA:
3> include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-EUTRACapability and with the rat-Type set to eutra as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3, according to the capabilityRequestFilter, if received;
\( 1> \) if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to utra-fdd:
\( 2> \) if the UE supports UTRA-FDD:
