\( 4> \) consider the DRB to be configured for SDT;
\( 3> \) if sdt-SRB2-Indication is configured:
4> consider the SRB2 to be configured for SDT;
3> for each of the RLC bearer that is part of the UE configuration:
4> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];
\( 3> \) for SRB2, if it is resumed and for SRB1:
4> trigger the PDCP entity to perform SDU discard as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
3> if configured grant resources for SDT are configured:
4> configure the MAC entity with the configured grant resources for SDT and instruct MAC to start the cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer;
\( 2> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 2> \) for each measld, if the associated reportConfig has a reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
3> for the associated reportConfigld:
\( 4> \) remove the entry with the matching reportConfigId from the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 3> \) if the associated measObjectld is only associated to a reportConfig with reportType set to condTriggerConfig:

4> remove the entry with the matching measObjectld from the measObjectList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 3> \) remove the entry with the matching measId from the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) re-establish RLC entities for SRB1;
\( 2> \) if the RRCRelease message with suspendConfig was received in response to an RRCResumeRequest or an RRCResumeRequest I:
\( 3> \) stop the timer T319 if running;
3> stop timer T319a if running;
\( 3> \) in the stored UE Inactive AS context:
4> replace the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCint }} \) keys with the current \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCint }} \) keyS;
4> replace the nextHopChainingCount with the value of nextHopChainingCount received in the RRCRelease message;
\( 4> \) replace the cellldentity with the cellldentity of the cell the UE has received the RRCRelease message;
\( 4> \) if the suspendConfig contains the sl-ServingCellInfo (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 5> \) replace the physical cell identity with the value of the \( s l \)-PhysCellld;
\( 5> \) replace the C-RNTI with the value of the sl-UEIdentityRemote;
4> else:
5> replace the C-RNTI with the C-RNTI used in the cell (see TS 38.321 [3]) the UE has received the RRCRelease message;
\( 5> \) replace the physical cell identity with the physical cell identity of the cell the UE has received the RRCRelease message;
