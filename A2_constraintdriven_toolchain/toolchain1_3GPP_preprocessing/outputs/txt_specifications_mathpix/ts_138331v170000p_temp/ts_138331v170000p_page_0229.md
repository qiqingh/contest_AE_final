3> set the failureType as beamFailureRecoveryFailure;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the failureType as randomAccessProblem;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the MCGFailurelnformation message to provide indication from MCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as ric-MaxNumRetx:
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the MCGFailureInformation message due to consistent uplink LBT failures on the MCG:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as Ibt-Failure;
1> else if connected as an IAB-node and the MCGFailureInformation message is initiated due to the reception of a BH RLF indication on BAP entity from the MCG:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as bh-RLF.
5.7.3b.4 Actions related to transmission of MCGFailurelnformation message

The UE shall set the contents of the MCGFailureInformation message as follows:
\( 1> \) include and set failureType in accordance with 5.7.3b.3;
1> for each MeasObjectNR configured by a measConfig associated with the MCG, and for which measurement results are available:
\( 2> \) include an entry in measResultFreqList;
\( 2> \) if there is a measld configured with the MeasObjectNR and a reportConfig which has rsType set to ssb:
\( 3> \) set ssbFrequency in measResultFreqList to the value indicated by ssbFrequency as included in the MeasObjectNR;
\( 2> \) if there is a measId configured with the MeasObjectNR and a reportConfig which has rsType set to csi-rs:
3> set refFreqCSI-RS in measResultFreqList to the value indicated by refFreqCSI-RS as included in the associated measurement object;
\( 2> \) if a serving cell is associated with the MeasObjectNR:
3> set measResultServingCell in measResultFreqList to include the available quantities of the concerned cell and in accordance with the performance requirements in TS 38.133 [14];

2> set the measResultNeighCellList in measResultFreqList to include the best measured cells, ordered such that the best cell is listed first, and based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and set its fields as follows;
\( 3> \) ordering the cells with sorting as follows:
\( 4> \) based on SS/PBCH block if SS/PBCH block measurement results are available and otherwise based on CSI-RS;
\( 4> \) using RSRP if RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise using RSRQ if RSRQ measurement results are available, otherwise using SINR;

3> for each neighbour cell included:
\( 4> \) include the optional fields that are available.
1> for each EUTRA frequency the UE is configured to measure by measConfig for which measurement results are available:
