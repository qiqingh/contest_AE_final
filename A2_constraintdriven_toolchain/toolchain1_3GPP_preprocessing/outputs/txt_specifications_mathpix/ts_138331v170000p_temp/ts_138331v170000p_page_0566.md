\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline FeatureCombinationPreambles field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deltaPreamble \\
Power offset between msg3 and RACH preamble transmission. If configured, this parameter overrides msg3-DeitaPreamble or msgA-DeltaPreamble, Actual value \( = \) field value \( { }^{*} 2 \) [dB] (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
featureCombination \\
Indicates which combination of features that the preambles indicated by this IE are associated with.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
messagePowerOffsetGroupB \\
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to -infinity. Value \( d B 0 \) corresponds to \( 0 \mathrm{~dB}, d B 5 \) corresponds to 5 dB and so on (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfPreamblesForThisPartition \\
It determines how many consecutive preambles are associated to the Feature Combination starting from the starting preamble(s) per SSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA \\
It determines how many consecutive preambles are associated to Group A starting from the starting preamble(s). The remaining preambles associated to the Feature \\
Combination are associated to Group B
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-SizeGroupA \\
Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2). If this feature combination preambles are associated to a RACH-ConfigCommon-twostepRA, this field correspond to msgA-RA-SizeGroupA, otherwise it corresponds to ra-SizeGroupA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rsrp-ThresholdSSB \\
L1-RSRP threshold used for determining whether a candidate beam may be used by the UE to attempt contention free random access to recover from beam failure (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6). If this feature combination preambles are associated to a RACH-ConfigCommon-twostepRA, this field correspond to msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB, otherwise it corresponds to rsrp-ThresholdSSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config \\
If present it specifies how the 2-step RACH preambles identified by this FeatureCombinationPreambles are mapped to a PUSCH slot separate from the one defined in MsgA-ConfigCommon-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-SharedRO-Maskindex \\
Mask index (see 38.321). \\
Indicates a subset of ROs where preambles are allocated for this feature combination. This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, and 4-step and 2-step has shared ROs, then all ROs are shared. \\
Editor's note: This field description can be clarified further later.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startPreambleForThisPartition \\
It defines the first preamble associated with the Feature Combination. If \( \mathrm{N}<1 \) the first preamble in each PRACH occasion is the one having the same index indicated by this field. If \( \mathrm{N}>=1 \) in each PRACH occasion N blocks of preambles associated with the Feature Combination are define, each having start index \( n \cdot N_{\text {preamble }}^{\text {latal }} / N+ \) \\
startPreambleForThisPartition (see 38.213).
\end{tabular} \\

\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Conditional Presence } & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Explanation } \\
\hline MsgAConfigCommon & The field is optional present, Need R, if FeatureCombinationPreambles is included in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA. \\
Otherwise, it is absent, Need R.
