\( 4> \) if measurements are available for the measObjectEUTRA:
\( 5> \) set the measResultListEUTRA in measResultNeighCells to include the best measured cells ordered such that the cell with highest RSRP is listed first if RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise the cell with highest RSRQ is listed first, based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 5> \) for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are available;
3> for each of the neighbour cells included in measResultNeighCells:
4> if the cell was a candidate target cell included in the condRRCReconfig within the conditionalReconfiguration configured by the source PCell, in which the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was applied:
\( 5> \) set the choCandidate to true in measResultNR;
\( 3> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7;
\( 1> \) release successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync.
The UE may discard the successful handover information, i.e., release the UE variable VarSuccessHO-Report, 48 hours after the last successful handover information is added to the VarSuccessHO-Report.
5.7.12 IAB Other Information
5.7.12.1 General

Figure 5.7.12.1-1: IAB Other Information procedure

The IAB Other Information procedure is used by IAB-MT to request the IAB-donor-CU to allocate IP address or inform the IAB-donor-CU of the IP address for the collocated IAB-DU.
5.7.12.2 Initiation

Upon initiation of the procedure, the IAB-MT shall:
1> initiate transmission of the IABOtherInformation message in accordance with 5.7.12.3;
5.7.12.3 Actions related to transmission of IABOtherInformation message

The IAB-MT shall set the contents of IABOtherInformation message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the procedure is used to request IP addresses:
\( 2> \) if IPv4 addresses are requested:
3> set the iab-IPv4-AddressNumReq to the number of [Pv4 addresses requested per specific usage;
2 if IPv6 addresses or [Pv6 address prefixes are requested:
