\( 2> \) if cnType is included:
\( 3> \) after the cell selection, indicate the available CN Type(s) and the received cnType to upper layers;
NOTE 1: Handling the case if the E-UTRA cell selected after the redirection does not support the core network type specified by the cnType, is up to UE implementation.
\( 2> \) if voiceFallbackIndication is included:
3> consider the RRC connection release was for EPS fallback for IMS voice (see TS 23.502 [43]);
1> if the RRCRelease message includes the cellReselectionPriorities or freqPriorityListNRSlicing:
\( 2> \) store the cell reselection priority information provided by the cellReselectionPriorities or freqPriorityListNRSlicing;
\( 2> \) if the \( t 320 \) is included:
\( 3> \) start timer T320, with the timer value set according to the value of \( t 320 \);
1> else:
2> apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the system information;
\( 1> \) if deprioritisation Req is included and the UE supports RRC connection release with deprioritisation:
\( 2> \) start or restart timer T325 with the timer value set to the deprioritisationTimer signalled;
\( 2> \) store the deprioritisationReq until T325 expiry;
NOTE 1a: The UE stores the deprioritisation request irrespective of any cell reselection absolute priority assignments (by dedicated or common signalling) and regardless of RRC connections in NR or other RATs unless specified otherwise.
\( 1> \) if the RRCRelease includes the measIdleConfig:
\( 2> \) if T331 is running:
3> stop timer T331;
\( 3> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3;
\( 2> \) if the measIdleConfig is set to setup:
3> store the received measIdleDuration in VarMeasIdleConfig;
\( 3> \) start timer T331 with the value set to measIdleDuration;
3> if the measIdleConfig contains measIdleCarrierListNR:
4> store the received measIdleCarrierListNR in VarMeasIdleConfig;
3> if the measIdleConfig contains measIdleCarrierListEUTRA:
4> store the received measIdleCarrierListEUTRA in VarMeasIdleConfig;
3> if the measIdleConfig contains validityAreaList:
4> store the received validityAreaList in VarMeasIdleConfig;
\( 1> \) if the RRCRelease includes suspendConfig:
\( 2> \) reset MAC and release the default MAC Cell Group configuration, if any;
\( 2> \) apply the received suspendConfig except the received nextHopChainingCount;
\( 2> \) if the sdt-Config is configured:
\( 3> \) for each of the DRB in the sdt-DRB-List:
