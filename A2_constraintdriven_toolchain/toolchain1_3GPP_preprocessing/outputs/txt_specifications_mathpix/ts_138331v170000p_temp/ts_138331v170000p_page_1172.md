A. 5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages

The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-[dle should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A. 6 Guidelines regarding use of need codes

The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional downlink fields:
- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
- use Need M (=Maintain);
- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
- use Need R (=Release);
- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
- use Need N (=None);
- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
- use Need S (=Specified);
- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text or in the field description table.
A. 7 Guidelines regarding use of conditions

Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the following types can be distinguished:
- Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field \( B \) is mandatory present if the same message includes field \( A \) and when it is set value \( X \).
