\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline ConfiguredGrantConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
antennaPort \\
Indicates the antenna port(s) to be used for this configuration, and the maximum bitwidth is 5. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2, and TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1. The network does not configure this for CG-SDT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
autonomousTx \\
If this field is present, the Configured Grant configuration is configured with autonomous transmission, see TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
betaOffsetCG-UCI \\
Beta offset for CG-UCI in CG-PUSCH, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.3
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-betaOffsetsCrossPri0, cg-betaOffsetsCrossPri1 \\
Selection between and configuration of dynamic and semi-static beta-offset for multiplexing HARQ-ACK in CG-PUSCH with different priorities. \\
The field cg-betaOffsetsCrossPriO indicates multiplexing LP HARQ-ACK in HP CG-PUSCH. This field is configured only if phy-Prioritylndex-r16 is configured with value p1. \\
The field cg-betaOffsetsCrossPri1 indicates multiplexing HP HARQ-ACK in LP CG-PUSCH. This field is configured only if phy-Prioritylndex-r16 is configured with value p0.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-COT-SharingList \\
Indicates a table for COT sharing combinations (see 37.213 [48], clause 4.1.3). One row of the table can be set to noCOT-Sharing to indicate that there is no channel occupancy sharing. If the cg-Retransmission Timer-r16 is configured and the UE operates as an initiating device in semi-static channel access mode (see TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.3), then cg-COT-SharingList-r16 is configured and the UE ignores the field channelAccessPriority-r16. \\
Editor's note (IIoT): The last part "the UE ignores the field channelAccessPriority-r16" may be already implemented by RAN1 spec 37.213. RAN2 to discuss in the maintenance phase on whether to remove this to avoid misinterpretation. The field cg-COT-SharingList-r17 is only applicable for FR2-2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-COT-SharingOffset \\
Indicates the offset from the end of the slot where the COT sharing indication in UCI is enabled where the offset in symbols is equal to \( 14^{*} \mathrm{n} \), where n is the signaled value for cg-COT-SharingOffset. Applicable when ul-toDL-COT-SharingED-Threshold-r16 is not configured (see 37.213 [48], clause 4.1.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-DMRS-Configuration \\
DMRS configuration (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-minDFI-Delay \\
Indicates the minimum duration (in unit of symbols) from the ending symbol of the PUSCH to the starting symbol of the PDCCH containing the downlink feedback indication (DFI) carrying HARQ-ACK for this PUSCH. The HARQ-ACK received before this minimum duration is not considered as valid for this PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.5). The following minimum duration values are supported, depending on the configured subcarrier spacing [symbols]: \\
\( 15 \mathrm{kHz}: \quad 7, \mathrm{~m}^{\star} 14 \), where \( \mathrm{m}=\{1,2,3,4\} \) \\
\( 30 \mathrm{kHz}: ~ 7, \mathrm{~m}^{*} 14 \), where \( \mathrm{m}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} \) \\
\( 60 \mathrm{kHz}: \quad 7, \mathrm{~m}^{*} 14 \), where \( \mathrm{m}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\} \)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-nrofPUSCH-inSlot \\
Indicates the number of consecutive PUSCH configured to CG within a slot where the SLIV indicating the first PUSCH and additional PUSCH appended with the same length (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-nrofSlots \\
Indicates the number of allocated slots in a configured grant periodicity following the time instance of configured grant offset (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-RetransmissionTimer \\
Indicates the initial value of the configured retransmission timer (see TS 38.321 [3]) in multiples of periodicity. The value of cg-RetransmissionTimer is always less than or equal to the value of configured GrantTimer. This field is always configured together with harq-Proc/D-Offset. This field is not configured for operation in licensed spectrum or simultaneously with harq-Proc/D-Offset2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-StartingOffsets \\
This field is not applicable for a UE which is allowed to operate as an initiating device in semi-static channel access mode, i.e., not applicable for a UE configured with UE FFP parameters (e.g. period, offset) regardless whether the UE would initiate its own COT or would share gNB's COT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-UCI-Multiplexing \\
If present, this field indicates that in the case of PUCCH overlapping with CG-PUSCH(s) within a PUCCH group, the CG-UCI and HARQ-ACK are jointly encoded (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantConfigindex \\
Indicates the index of the Configured Grant configurations within the BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
