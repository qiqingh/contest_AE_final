5.3.5.8 Reconfiguration failure
5.3.5.8.1 Void
5.3.5.8.2 Inability to comply with RRCReconfiguration

NOTE 00: The UE behaviour specified in this clause does not apply to the fields in ServingCellConfigCommon that are defined in release-16 and later. The UE ignores, i.e. does not take an action on and does not store, the fields that it does not support or does not comprehend.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE is in (NG)EN-DC:
\( 2> \) if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfiguration message received over SRB3;
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received as part of ConditionalReconfiguration:
\( 4> \) continue using the configuration used prior to when the inability to comply with the RRCReconfiguration message was detected;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of RRCReconfiguration message;
\( 3> \) if MCG transmission is not suspended:
\( 4> \) initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in clause 5.7 .3 to report SCG reconfiguration error, upon which the connection reconfiguration procedure ends;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) intitate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.7, upon which the connection reconfiguration procedure ends;
\( 2> \) else, if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfiguration message received over SRB1;
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received as part of ConditionalReconfiguration:
4 continue using the configuration used prior to when the inability to comply with the RRCReconfiguration message was detected;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of RRCReconfiguration message;
\( 3> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.7, upon which the connection reconfiguration procedure ends.
\( 1> \) else if \( R R C \) Reconfiguration is received via NR (i.e., NR standalone, NE-DC, or NR-DC):
\( 2> \) if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfiguration message received over SRB3;

NOTE 0: This case does not apply in NE-DC.
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received as part of ConditionalReconfiguration:
4 continue using the configuration used prior to when the inability to comply with the RRCReconfiguration message was detected;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of RRCReconfiguration message;
