\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierInfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
referenceCarrierIndex \\
The serving cell ID of the carrier which is to be used as the reference for interpreting the Tx Direction Current location as reported using txDirectCurrentLocation-r16. The numerology of the uplink BWP ID reported with bwp-/d-r16 for this serving cell is the numerology used for interpreting the reported subcarrier location.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
shift7dot5kHz \\
Indicates whether there is 7.5 kHz shift or not. 7.5 kHz shift is applied if the field is set to true. Otherwise 7.5 kHz shift is not applied.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
txDirectCurrentLocation \\
The uplink Tx Direct Current location for the two carrier uplink CA with the serving cells reported using carrierOnelnfo-r16 and carrierTwolnfo-r16. Values in the range of this field between 0 and 3299 indicate the subcarrier index of the uplink Tx Direct Current location with the subcarrier taken from the serving cell with ID referenceCarrierindex and the numerology of the corresponding uplink BWP reported for this serving cell. Value 3300 indicates "Outside the carrier" and value 3301 indicates "Undetermined position within the carrier".
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UplinkTxDirectCurrentCarrierinfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bwp-ld \\
The BWP ID of the serving cell which is part of the two carrier uplink carrier aggregation. The UE shall not report this field if the serving cell is reported as deactivated using deactivatedCarrier-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deactivatedCarrier \\
For the reported uplink Tx Direct Current location(s) corresponding to singlePA-TxDirectCurrent-r16, indicates whether the carrier is deactivated or not for this serving cell. If the carrier refers to the PCell, the UE shall not set this field to deactivated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servCellindex \\
The serving cell ID of the serving cell which is part of the two carrier uplink carrier aggregation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Uplink TxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierOneinfo \\
The serving cell ID and BWP ID of the first carrier of the uplink carrier aggregation for which the uplink Tx Direct Current location(s) are being reported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierTwoinfo \\
The serving cell ID and BWP ID of the second carrier of the uplink carrier aggregation for which the uplink Tx Direct Current location(s) are being reported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
singlePA-TxDirectCurrent \\
The uplink Tx Direct Current location for the UE which support single PA for this uplink carrier aggregation. For the UEs which support dual PA for this uplink carrier aggregation, this field is for reporting the uplink Tx Direct Current location of the first PA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
secondPA-TxDirectCurrent \\
The uplink Tx Direct Current location used by the UE with the second PA for the UEs which support dual PA for this uplink carrier aggregation. This field shall be absent for the UplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier entity where deactivatedCarrier of carrierOnelnfo or carrierTwolnfo is set to deactivated.

- ZP-CSI-RS-Resource

The IE ZP-CSI-RS-Resource is used to configure a Zero-Power (ZP) CSI-RS resource (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.2). Reconfiguration of a ZP-CSI-RS-Resource between periodic or semi-persistent and aperiodic is not supported.
