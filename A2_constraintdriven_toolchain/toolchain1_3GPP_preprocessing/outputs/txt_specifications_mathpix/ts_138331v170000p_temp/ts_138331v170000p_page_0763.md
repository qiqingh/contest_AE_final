\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline EventTriggerConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
a3-Offset/a6-Offset \\
Offset value(s) to be used in NR measurement report triggering condition for event a3/a6. The actual value is field value * 0.5 dB .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
aN-ThresholdM \\
Threshold value associated to the selected trigger quantity (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) per RS Type (e.g. SS/PBCH block, CSI-RS) to be used in NR measurement report triggering condition for event number aN. If multiple thresholds are defined for event number aN, the thresholds are differentiated by M . The network configures aN-Threshold1 only for events A1, A2, A4, A5 and a5-Threshold2 only for event A5. In the same eventA5, the network configures the same quantity for the MeasTriggerQuantity of the a5Threshold 1 and for the MeasTriggerQuantity of the a5-Threshold2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelOccupancyThreshold \\
RSSI threshold which is used for channel occupancy evaluation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
distanceThresFromReference1, distanceThresFromReference2 \\
Distance from a reference location configured with referenceLocation1 or referenceLocation2. Each step represents 50m.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eventld \\
Choice of NR event triggered reporting criteria. If network configured eventD1 network shall configure includeCommonLocationInfo for the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport \\
Max number of RS indexes to include in the measurement report for A1-A6 events.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxReportCells \\
Max number of non-serving cells to include in the measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
referenceLocation1, referenceLocation2 \\
Reference locations used for location based event. The referenceLocation1 is associated to serving cell and referenceLocation2 is associated to candidate target cell. The value of the field is same as Ellipsoid-Point defined in TS37.355. The first/leftmost bit of the first octet contains the most significant bit.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportAddNeighMeas \\
Indicates that the UE shall include the best neighbour cells per serving frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportAmount \\
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportOnLeave \\
Indicates whether or not the UE shall initiate the measurement reporting procedure when the leaving condition is met for a cell in cellsTriggeredList, as specified in 5.5.4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportQuantityCell \\
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportQuantityRS-Indexes \\
Indicates which measurement information per RS index the UE shall include in the measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeToTrigger \\
Time during which specific criteria for the event needs to be met in order to trigger a measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
useAllowedCellList \\
Indicates whether only the cells included in the allow-list of the associated measObject are applicable as specified in 5.5.4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
useT312 \\
If value TRUE is configured, the UE shall use the timer T312 with the value 1312 as specified in the corresponding measObjectNR. If value FALSE is configured, the timer T312 is considered as disabled. Network configures value TRUE only if reportType is set to eventTriggered.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
xN-ThresholdM \\
Threshold value associated to the selected trigger quantity (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) per RS Type (e.g. SS/PBCH block, CSI-RS) to be used in NR measurement report triggering condition for event xN . If multiple thresholds are defined for event number xN , the thresholds are differentiated by \( \mathrm{M} . \times 1 \)-Threshold1 and \( \times 2 \)-Threshold indicates the threshold value for the serving L2 U2N Relay UE, \( \times 1 \)-Threshold2 indicates the threshold value for the NR Cells.
