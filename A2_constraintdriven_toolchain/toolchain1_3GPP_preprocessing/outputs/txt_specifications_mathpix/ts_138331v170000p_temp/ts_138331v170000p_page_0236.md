3> initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide MUSIM assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED;

3> start the timer T346g with the timer value set to the musim-LeaveWithoutResponseTimer;
1> if configured to provide MUSIM assistance information without leaving RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the MUSIM gap(s) and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistancelnformation message with musim-GapPreferenceList since it was configured to provide MUSIM assistance information without leaving RRC_CONNECTED; or
\( 2> \) if the current musim-GapPreferenceList is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including musim-GapPreferenceList and the timer T346h is not running:
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the current musim-GapPreferenceList;

3> start the timer T346h with the timer value set to the musim-GapProhibitTimer.
\( 1> \) if configured to provide the relaxation state of RLM measurements of a cell group:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with rim-MeasRelaxationState since it was configured to provide the relaxation state of RLM measurements for the cell group; or
\( 2> \) if the relaxation state of RLM measurements for the cell group has changed since the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including rim-MeasRelaxationState of the cell group and timer T346j associated with the cell group is not running:
\( 3> \) start timer T346j with the timer value set to the nim-RelaxtionReportingProhibitTimer;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the relaxation state of RLM measurements of the cell group;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide the relaxation state of BFD measurements of serving cells of a cell group:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with bfd-MeasRelaxationState since it was configured to provide the relaxation state of BFD measurements for the cell group; or
\( 2> \) if the relaxation state of BFD measurements in any serving cell of the cell group has changed since the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including bfd-MeasRelaxationState of the cell group and timer T346k associated with the cell group is not running:

3> start timer T346k with the timer value set to the bfd-RelaxtionReportingProhibitTimer;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the relaxation state of BFD measurements of serving cells of the cell group.

1> if data and/or signalling mapped to radio bearers not configured for SDT becomes available during SDT (i.e. while T319a is running):
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with nonSDT-DataIndication since the initiation of the current resume procedure for SDT:

3> initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide nonSDT-Datalndication.
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference for SCG deactivation and timer T346i is not running;
\( 2> \) if the UE prefers the SCG to be deactivated and did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with scg-DeactivationPreference since it was configured to provide its SCG deactivation preference; or
\( 2> \) if the UE preference for SCG deactivation is different from the last indicated scg-DeactivationPreference since the UE was configured to provide its SCG deactivation preference:

3> start timer T346i with the timer value set to the scg-DeactivationPreferenceProhibitTimer;
