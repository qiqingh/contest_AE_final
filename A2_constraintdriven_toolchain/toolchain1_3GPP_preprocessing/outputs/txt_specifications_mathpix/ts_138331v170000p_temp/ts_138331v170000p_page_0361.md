\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-IP-AddressToReleaseList \\
List of IP address allocated for IAB-node to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
lab-IP-Usage \\
This field is used to indicate the usage of the assigned IP address. If this field is not configured, the assigned IP address is used for all traffic.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-donor-DU-BAP-Address \\
This field is used to indicate the BAP address of the IAB-donor-DU where the IP address is anchored.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
keySetChangeIndicator \\
Indicates whether UE shall derive a new \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \). If reconfigurationWithSync is included, value true indicates that a \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key is derived from a \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{amF}} \) key taken into use through the latest successful NAS SMC procedure, or N2 handover procedure with Kamf change, as described in TS 33.501 [11] for \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNb}} \) re-keying. Value false indicates that the new \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key is obtained from the current Kgne key or from the NH as described in TS 33.501 [11].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
masterCellGroup \\
Configuration of master cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrdc-ReleaseAndAdd \\
This field indicates that the current SCG configuration is released and a new SCG is added at the same time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup \\
Includes an RRC message for SCG configuration in NR-DC or NE-DC. \\
For NR-DC (nr-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup contains the RRCReconfiguration message as generated (entirely) by SN gNB. In this version of the specification, the RRC message can only include fields secondaryCellGroup, otherConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, measConfig and bap-Config. \\
For NE-DC (eutra-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRC message can only include the field scg-Configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapConfig \\
Indicates the MUSIM gap configuration and controls setup/release of MUSIM gaps.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nas-Container \\
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for this field, although it affects activation of AS security after inter-system handover to NR. The content is defined in TS 24.501 [23].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForGapsConfigNR \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap requirement information of NR target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForNCSG-ConfigEUTRA \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of E-UTRA target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and \\
RRCResumeComplete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForNCSG-ConfigNR \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of NR target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nextHopChainingCount \\
Parameter NCC: See TS 33.501 [11]
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
onDemandSIB-Request \\
If the field is present, the UE is allowed to request SIB(s) on-demand while in RRC_CONNECTED according to clause 5.2.2.3.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
onDemandSIB-RequestProhibitTimer \\
Prohibit timer for requesting SIB(s) on-demand while in RRC_CONNECTED according to clause 5.2.2.3.5. Value in seconds. Value s0 means prohibit timer is set to 0 seconds, value s0dot5 means prohibit timer is set to 0.5 seconds, value s1 means prohibit timer is set to 1 second and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
otherConfig \\
Contains configuration related to other configurations. When configured for the SCG, only fields drx-PreferenceConfig, maxBW-PreferenceConfig, maxBW-PreferenceConfigFR2-2, maxCC-PreferenceConfig, maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceConfig, maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceConfigFR2-2, minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceConfig, minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceConfigExt, btNameList, wanNameList, sensorNameList and obtainCommonLocation can be included.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
radioBearerConfig \\
Configuration of Radio Beares (DRBs, SRBs, multicast MRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. In EN-DC this field may only be present if the RRCReconfiguration is transmitted over SRB3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
