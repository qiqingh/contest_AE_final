11 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
11.1 General

This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
11.2 Inter-node RRC messages
11.2.1 General

This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.
