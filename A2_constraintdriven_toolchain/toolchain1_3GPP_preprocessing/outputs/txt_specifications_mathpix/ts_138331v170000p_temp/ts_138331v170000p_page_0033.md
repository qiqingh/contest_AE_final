3GPP TS 38.331 version 17.0.0 Release 17
32
ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)
- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured UEs;
- Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement configured UEs;
- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data.
- RRC_INACTIVE:
- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
- The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
- A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
- Transfer of unicast data and/or signalling to/from UE over radio bearers configured for SDT;

The UE:
- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
- During SDT procedure, monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging using fullI-RNTI;
- If configured by upper layers for MBS multicast reception, monitors Paging channel for paging using TMGI;
- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
- Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when moving outside the configured RAN-based notification area;
- Acquires system information, while SDT procedure is not ongoing, and can send SI request (if configured);
- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, performs logging of available measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured UEs;
- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement configured UEs;
- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data.
- RRC_CONNECTED:
- The UE stores the AS context;
- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
- Transfer of MBS multicast data to UE;
- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the SpCell, for increased band width;
- For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for increased band width;
