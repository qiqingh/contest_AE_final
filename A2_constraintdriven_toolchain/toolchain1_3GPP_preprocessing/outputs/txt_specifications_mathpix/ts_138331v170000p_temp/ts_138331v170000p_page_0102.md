5.3.5.8.3 T304 expiry (Reconfiguration with sync Failure) or T420 expiry (Path switch failure)

The UE shall:
1> if T304 of the MCG expires, or
1> if T420 expires, or,
1> if the target L2 U2N Relay UE changes its serving PCell before path switch (i.e. the received RRCReconfiguration message containing reconfigurationWithSync indicating path switch as specified in 5.3.5.5.2):
\( 2> \) release dedicated preambles provided in rach-ConfigDedicated if configured;
\( 2> \) release dedicated msgA PUSCH resources provided in rach-ConfigDedicated if configured;
\( 2> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured, and radio link failure is not detected in the source PCell, according to clause 5.3.10.3:
\( 3> \) reset MAC for the target PCell and release the MAC configuration for the target PCell ;
3> for each DAPS bearer:
4 release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the target PCell;

4> reconfigure the PDCP entity to release DAPS as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 3> \) for each SRB:
4> if the masterKeyUpdate was not received:
\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity for the source PCell with state variables continuation as specified in TS 38.323 [5];

4> release the PDCP entity for the target PCell;
4> release the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the target PCell;
\( 4> \) trigger the PDCP entity for the source PCell to perform SDU discard as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
4> re-establish the RLC entity for the source PCell;
\( 3> \) release the physical channel configuration for the target PCell;
\( 3> \) discard the keys used in target PCell (the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCenc }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCint }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the Kupene key), if any;

3> resume suspended SRBs in the source PCell;
\( 3> \) for each non-DAPS bearer:
4> revert back to the UE configuration used for the DRB or multicast MRB in the source PCell, includes PDCP, RLC states variables, the security configuration and the data stored in transmission and reception buffers in PDCP and RLC entities;

3> revert back to the UE measurement configuration used in the source PCell;
3> store the handover failure information in VarRLF-Report as described in the clause 5.3.10.5;
\( 3> \) initiate the failure information procedure as specified in clause 5.7 .5 to report DAPS handover failure.
\( 2> \) else:
3> revert back to the UE configuration used in the source PCell;
