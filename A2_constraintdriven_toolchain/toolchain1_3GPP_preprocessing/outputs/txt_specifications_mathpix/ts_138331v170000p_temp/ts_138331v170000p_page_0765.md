u-DelayValueConfig \\
If the field is present, the UE shall perform the actual UL PDCP Packet Average Delay measurement per DRB as specified in TS 38.314 [53] and the UE shall ignore the fields reportQuantityCell and maxReportCells. The applicable values for the corresponding reportinterval are (one of the) (ms120, ms240, ms480, ms640, ms1024, ms2048, ms5120, ms10240, ms20480, ms40960, min1,min6, min12, min30\}. The report/nterval indicates the periodicity for performing and reporting of UL PDCP Packet Average Delay per DRB measurement as specified in TS 38.314 [53].

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ul-ExcessDelayConfig \\
If the field is present, the UE shall perform the actual UL PDCP Excess Packet Delay per DRB measurement as specified in TS 38.314 [53] and the UE shall ignore the fields reportQuantityCell and maxReportCells. The applicable values for the corresponding reportinterval are (one of the) (ms120, ms240, ms480, ms640, ms1024, ms2048, ms5120, ms10240, ms20480, ms40960, min1,min6, min12, min30\}.

drx-SFTD-NeighMeas \\
Indicates that the UE shall use available idle periods (i.e. DRX off periods) for the SFTD measurement in NR standalone. The network only includes drx-SFTD-NeighMeas field when reprtSFTD-NeighMeas is set to true.

reportSFTD-NeighMeas \\
Indicates whether UE is required to perform SFTD measurement between PCell and NR neighbour cells in NR standalone. The network does not include this field if reportSFTD-Meas is set to true.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportRSRP \\
Indicates whether UE is required to include RSRP result of NR PSCell or NR neighbour cells in SFTD measurement result, derived based on SSB. If it is set to true, the network should ensure that ssb-ConfigMobility is included in the measurement object for NR PSCell or NR neighbour cells.
