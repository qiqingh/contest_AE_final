- is reporting that a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure has been detected,
- is reporting the sidelink UE capability information of the associated peer UE for unicast communication,
- is reporting the RLC mode information of the sidelink data radio bearer(s) received from the associated peer UE for unicast communication,
- is reporting the sidelink DRX configuration received from the associated peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication,
- is reporting the sidelink DRX assistance information received from the associated peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication,
- is reporting, for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication, [FFS on additional information],
- is reporting, for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication, the Destination Layer-2 ID and QoS profile associated with its interested services that sidelink DRX is applied,
- is reporting DRX configuration reject information from its associated peer RX UE, when the UE is a TX UE and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1 ,
- is reporting parameters related to U2N relay operation.

Editor's Note: FFS on the additional information/Tx profile, pending on reply from SA2 relate to WA "no additional RAN2 work if SA2 confirms it is feasible (whether the mapping from L2 id to TX profile is feasible in the gNB (like what we did in LTE)".
5.8.3.2 Initiation

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication or NR sidelink discovery or NR sidelink U2N relay operation that is in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure to indicate it is (interested in) receiving or transmitting NR sidelink communication or NR sidelink discovery or NR sidelink U2N relay operation in several cases including upon successful connection establishment or resuming, upon change of interest, upon changing QoS profiles, upon receiving UECapabilityInformationSidelink from the associated peer UE, upon RLC mode information updated from the associated peer UE or upon change to a PCell providing SIB12 including sl-ConfigCommonNR. A UE capable of NR sidelink communication may initiate the procedure to request assignment of dedicated sidelink DRB configuration and transmission resources for NR sidelink communication transmission. A UE capable of NR sidelink communication may initiate the procedure to report to the network that a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure has been declared. A UE capable of NR sidelink discovery may initiate the procedure to request assignment of dedicated resources for sidelink discovery transmission or sidelink discovery reception. A UE capable of U2N relay operation may initiate the procedure to report/update parameters for acting as U2N Relay UE or U2N Remote UE (including L2 Remote UE's source L2 ID).

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure to report the sidelink DRX configuration received from the associated peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication, upon accepting the sidelink DRX configuration from the associated peer UE. A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1 may initiate the procedure to report the sidelink DRX assistance information received from the associated peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication, upon receiving sidelink DRX assistance information from the associated peer UE.

An RX UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure to report the Destination Layer-2 ID and QoS profile associated with its interested services that sidelink DRX is applied, for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication.

Upon initiating this procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if SIB12 including \( s \)-ConfigCommonNR is provided by the PCell:
\( 2> \) ensure having a valid version of SIB12 for the PCell;
\( 2> \) if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink communication on the frequency included in \( s l \) FreqInfoList in SIB12 of the PCell:

3> if the UE did not transmit a SidelinkUEInformationNR message since last entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
