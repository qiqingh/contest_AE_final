NOTE 1: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.

Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 and SRB4, including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].

Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split SRB is not supported for SRB0 and SRB3).

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3 are assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), (i.e. \( \mathrm{CAPC}=1 \) ) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.
4.3 Services
4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers

The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
- Broadcast of common control information;
- Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a mobile terminating call;
- Notification of UEs about ETWS and/or CMAS;
- Transfer of dedicated signalling;
- Broadcast of positioning assistance data;
- Transfer of application layer measurement configuration and reporting.
4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers

In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower layers:
- Integrity protection, ciphering and loss-less in-sequence delivery of information without duplication;
4.4 Functions

The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
- Broadcast of system information:
- Including NAS common information;
- Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. cell (re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information) and information (also) applicable for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED (e.g. common channel configuration information);
- Including ETWS notification, CMAS notification;
- Including positioning assistance data.
- RRC connection control:
- Paging;
- Establishment/modification/suspension/resumption/release of RRC connection, including e.g. assignment/modification of UE identity (C-RNTI, fullI-RNTI, etc.), establishment/modification/suspension/resumption/release of SRBs (except for SRB0);
- Access barring;
