The UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in BandCombinationList (without suffix). If the field is included in supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only-v1610, the UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in BandCombinationList of supportedBand Combination ListNEDC-Only (without suffix) field. \\
If the field is included in supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only-v15a0, the UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in BandCombinationList (without suffix) of supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only (without suffix) field.

The UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in BandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch-r16. \\
For the field of supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch-v1700, if the UE does not support 2Tx-2Tx switching for a given band combination, the field of supportedBandPairListNR-v1700 in the corresponding entry is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ca-ParametersNRDC \\
If the field is included for a band combination in the NR capability container, the field indicates support of NR-DC. Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
featureSetCombinationDAPS \\
If this field is present for a band combination, it reports the feature set combination supported for the band combination when any DAPS bearer is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ne-DC-BC \\
If the field is included for a band combination in the MR-DC capability container, the field indicates support of NE-DC. Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
supportedBandPairListNR-r16, supportedBandPairListNR-v1700 \\
Indicates a list of band pair supporting UL Tx switching as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] for a given band combination. \\
A UE supporting 2Tx-2Tx switching should include both of supportedBandPairListNR-r16 and supportedBandPairListNR-v1700. And the UE shall include the same number of entries listed in the same order as in supportedBandPairListNR-r16. \\
If the UE does not support 2Tx-2Tx switching for a given band pair, the field of uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod2T2T in the corresponding entry is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srs-Switching TimesListNR \\
Indicates, for a particular pair of NR bands, the RF retuning time when switching between a NR carrier corresponding to this band entry and another (PUSCH-less) NR carrier corresponding to the band entry in the order indicated below: \\
- For the first NR band, the UE shall include the same number of entries for NR bands as in bandList, i.e. first entry corresponds to first NR band in bandList and so on, \\
- For the second NR band, the UE shall include one entry less, i.e. first entry corresponds to the second NR band in bandList and so on \\
- Andso on
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srs-Switching TimesListEUTRA \\
Indicates, for a particular pair of E-UTRA bands, the RF retuning time when switching between an E-UTRA carrier corresponding to this band entry and another (PUSCH-less) E-UTRA carrier corresponding to the band entry in the order indicated below: \\
- For the first E-UTRA band, the UE shall include the same number of entries for E-UTRA bands as in bandList, i.e. first entry corresponds to first E-UTRA band in bandList and so on, \\
- For the second E-UTRA band, the UE shall include one entry less, i.e. first entry corresponds to the second E-UTRA band in bandList and so on \\
- Andso on
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srs-TxSwitch \\
Indicates supported SRS antenna switch capability for the associated band. If the UE indicates support of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR, the UE is allowed to set this field for a band with associated FeatureSetUplinkld set to 0 for SRS carrier switching.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkTxSwitchingBandParametersList-v1700 \\
Indicates a list of per band per band combination capabilities for UL Tx switching.
