- a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN. 1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the conditionality of field 3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlockI to be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing field3 and field4).
10.5 Not comprehended field

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
\( 1> \) if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
\( 2> \) treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE: This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in clause 10.3.
