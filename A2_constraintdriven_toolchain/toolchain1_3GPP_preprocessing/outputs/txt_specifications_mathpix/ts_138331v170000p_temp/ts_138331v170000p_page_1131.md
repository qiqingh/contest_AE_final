\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxinterFreqMeasIdentitiesSCG \\
Indicates the maximum number of allowed measurement identities that the SCG is allowed to configure for inter-frequency measurement. The maximum value for this field is 10. If the field is absent, the SCG is allowed to configure inter-frequency measurements up to the maximum value. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxintraFreqMeasidentitiesSCG \\
Indicates the maximum number of allowed measurement identities that the SCG is allowed to configure for intra-frequency measurement on each serving frequency. The maximum value for this field is 9 (in case of (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC) or 10 (in case of NE-DC). If the field is absent, the SCG is allowed to configure intra-frequency measurements up to the maximum value on each serving frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxMeasCLI-ResourceSCG \\
Indicates the maximum number of CLIRSSI resources that the SCG is allowed to configure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxMeasFreqsSCG \\
Indicates the maximum number of NR inter-frequency carriers the SN is allowed to configure with PSCell for measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxMeasSRS-ResourceSCG \\
Indicates the maximum number of SRS resources that the SCG is allowed to configure for CLI measurement.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNumberCPCCandidates \\
Indicates the maximum numbers of conditional reconfigurations the SN is allowed to configure for SN initiated CPC. \\
Editor's note: This field is added following a working assumption, it can be revisited in next meeting if complications are found.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNumberROHC-ContextSessionsSN \\
Indicates the maximum number of ROHC context sessions allowed to SN terminated bearer, excluding context sessions that leave all headers uncompressed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNumberEHC-ContextsSN \\
Indicates the maximum number of EHC contexts allowed to the SN terminated bearer. The field indicates the number of contexts in addition to CID = "all zeros", as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxNumberUDC-DRB \\
Indicates the maximum number of UDC DRBs allowed to SN terminated bearer. This field is used in NGEN-DC, NR-DC and NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxToffset \\
Indicates the maximum Toffset value the SN is allowed to use for scheduling SCG transmissions (see TS 38.213 [13]). This field is used in NR-DC only when the fields nrdc-PC-mode-FR1-r16 or nrdc-PC-mode-FR2-r16 are set to dynamic. Value \( m s 0 d o t 5 \) corresponds to 0.5 ms , value \( m s 0 d o t 75 \) corresponds to 0.75 ms , value ms 1 corresponds to 1 ms and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measuredFrequencies \( M N \) \\
Used by MN to indicate a list of frequencies measured by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measGapConfig \\
Indicates the FR1 and perUE measurement gap configuration configured by MN.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measGapConfigFR2 \\
Indicates the FR2 measurement gap configuration configured by MN.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcg-RB-Config \\
Contains all of the fields in the IE RadioBearerConfig used in MN, used by the SN to support delta configuration to UE (i.e. when MN does not use full configuration option), for bearer type change between MN terminated bearer with NR PDCP to SN terminated bearer. It is also used to indicate the PDCP duplication related information for MN terminated split bearer (whether duplication is configured and if so, whether it is initially activated) in SN Addition/Modification procedure. Otherwise, this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultReportCGI, measResultReportCGI-EUTRA \\
Used by MN to provide SN with CGI-Info for the cell as per SN's request. In this version of the specification, the measResultReportCG/is used for (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC and the measResultReportCG/-EUTRA is used only for NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResuitSCG-EUTRA \\
This field includes the MeasResultSCG-FailureMRDC IE as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultSFTD-EUTRA \\
SFTD measurement results between the PCell and the E-UTRA PScell in NE-DC. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrdc-Assistanceinfo \\
Contains the IDC assistance information for MR-DC reported by the UE (see TS 36.331 [10]).
\end{tabular} \\
