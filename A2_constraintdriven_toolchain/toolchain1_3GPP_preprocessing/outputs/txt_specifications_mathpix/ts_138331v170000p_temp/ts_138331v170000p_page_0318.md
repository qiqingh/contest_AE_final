ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)
5.9.2.2 Initiation

A UE shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon becoming interested to receive MBS broadcast services. A UE interested to receive MBS broadcast services shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon entering the cell providing SIB20 (e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed due to the start of new MBS service(s). A UE that is receiving data via broadcast MRB shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed due to MCCH information modification other than the change caused by the start of new MBS session(s).

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information.
5.9.2.3 MCCH information acquisition by the UE

An MBS capable UE interested to or receiving an MBS broadcast service shall:
\( 1> \) if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
\( 2> \) start acquiring the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message on MCCH from the slot in which the change notification was received;
\( 1> \) if the UE enters a cell broadcasting SIB20:
\( 2> \) acquire the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message on MCCH at the next repetition period;
5.9.2.4 Actions upon reception of the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message

No UE requirements related to the contents of the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within the corresponding field descriptions.
5.9.3 Broadcast MRB configuration
5.9.3.1 General

The broadcast MRB configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure PDCP, RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive an broadcast MRB transmitted on MTCH, or upon modification of a configuration of a broadcast MRB received by the UE. The procedure applies to MBS capable UEs interested to or receiving an MBS broadcast service that are in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceMTCH.
5.9.3.2 Initiation

The UE applies the broadcast MRB establishment procedure to start receiving an MBS session of a MBS broadcast service it is interested in. The procedure may be initiated eg- upon start of the MBS session, upon entering a cell providing a MBS broadcast service UE is interested in, upon becoming interested in the MBS broadcast service, upon removal of UE capability limitations inhibiting reception of the MBS broadcast service UE is interested in.

The UE applies the broadcast MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session of a MBS broadcast service. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBS session, upon leaving the cell broadcasting the MBS service UE is interested in, upon losing interest in the MBS service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
5.9.3.3 Broadcast MRB establishment

Upon a broadcast MRB establishment, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) establish a PDCP entity and an RLC entity in accordance with MRB-InfoBroadcast for this broadcast MRB included in the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message and the configuration specified in 9.1.1.7;
