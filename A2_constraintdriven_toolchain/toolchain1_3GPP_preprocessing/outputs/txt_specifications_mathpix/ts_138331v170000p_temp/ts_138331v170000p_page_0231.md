5.7.4 UE Assistance Information
5.7.4.1 General

Figure 5.7.4.1-1: UE Assistance Information

The purpose of this procedure is for the UE to inform the network of:
- its delay budget report carrying desired increment/decrement in the connected mode DRX cycle length, or;
- its overheating assistance information, or;
- its IDC assistance information, or;
- its preference on DRX parameters for power saving, or;
- its preference on the maximum aggregated bandwidth for power saving, or;
- its preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers for power saving, or;
- its preference on the maximum number of MIMO layers for power saving, or;
- its preference on the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling for power saving, or;
- its preference on the RRC state, or;
- configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication, or;
- its preference in being provisioned with reference time information, or;
- its preference for FR2 UL gap, or;
- its preference to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED state for MUSIM operation, or;
- its preference on the MUSIM gaps, or;
- its relaxation state for RLM measurements, or;
- its relaxation state for BFD measurements, or;
- availability of data mapped to radio bearers which are not configured for SDT, or;
- its preference for the SCG to be deactivated, or;
- indicate that the UE has uplink data to transmit for a DRB for which there is no MCG RLC bearer while the SCG is deactivated, or;
- change of its fulfilment status for RRM measurement relaxation criterion.
5.7.4.2 Initiation

A UE capable of providing delay budget report in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases, including upon being configured to provide delay budget report and upon change of delay budget preference.
