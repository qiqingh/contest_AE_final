mediumBitmap \\
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the k -th bit is set to 1 , the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the SMTC measurement duration with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to \( \mathrm{k}-1 \) may be transmitted; if the kt -th bit is set to 0 , the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k -th bit is set to 0 , where \( \mathrm{k}> \) ssb-PositionQCL-Common and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. If ssb-PositionQCL is configured with a value smaller than ssb-PositionQCL-Common, only the leftmost K bits ( \( \mathrm{K}=s s b \)-PositionQCL) are applicable for the corresponding cell.

- SS-RSSI-Measurement

The IE SS-RSSI-Measurement is used to configure RSSI measurements based on synchronization reference signals.

\hline SS-RSSI-Measurement field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
endSymbol \\
Within a slot that is configured for RSSI measurements (see measurementSlots) the UE measures the RSSI from symbol 0 to symbol endSymbol. This field identifies the entry in Table 5.1.3-1 in TS 38.215 [9], which determines the actual end symbol.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measurementSlots \\
Indicates the slots in which the UE can perform RSSI measurements. The length of the BIT STRING is equal to the number of slots in the configured SMTC window (determined by the duration and by the subcarrierSpacing). The first (left-most / most significant) bit in the bitmap corresponds to the first slot in the SMTC window, the second bit in the bitmap corresponds to the second slot in the SMTC window, and so on. The UE measures in slots for which the corresponding bit in the bitmap is set to 1. In case this field is configured for a SCell with ca-SlotOffset-r16, the bits in the bitmap corresponds to the slots that are fully contained in the SMTC window.

- SubcarrierSpacing

The IE SubcarrierSpacing determines the subcarrier spacing. Restrictions applicable for certain frequencies, channels or signals are clarified in the fields that use this IE.
