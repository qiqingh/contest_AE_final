gin-ElementList \\
The G/N-ElementList contains one or more GIN elements. Each GIN element contains either one GIN, which is identified by a PLMN ID and a NID, or multiple GINs that share the same PLMN ID. The GIN index \( m \) is defined as \( \mathrm{d} 1+\mathrm{d} 2+\ldots+\mathrm{d}(n-1)+\mathrm{i} \) for the GIN included in the \( n \)-th entry of the gin-ElementList and the \( i \)-th entry of its corresponding G/NElement, where \( d(k) \) is the number of GIN index values used in the \( k \)-th gin-ElementList entry.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ginsPerSNPN-List \\
Indicates the supported GINs for each SNPN. The network includes the same number of entries as the number of SNPNs in snpn-Access/nfoList in provided in SIB1, and the n-th entry in this list corresponds to the n-th SNPN listed in snpn-AccessinfoList provided in SIB1. It is not present if there is only a single SNPN in snpn-AccessinfoList in SIB1, as in that case all GINs in this SIB is associated with that SNPN.

supportedGINs \\
Indicates the GINs which are supported by the given SNPN. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to the GIN with GIN index 0 , the second bit corresponds to the GIN with GIN index 1 and so on. A bit set to 1 indicates that the GIN is supported by the SNPN. If the field is is not present, then the corresponding SNPN does not support any GINs.
