\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RRCReconfiguration-IEs field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bap-Config \\
This field is used to configure the BAP entity for IAB nodes.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bap-Address \\
Indicates the BAP address of an IAB-node. The BAP address of an IAB-node cannot be changed once configured to the BAP entity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
conditionalReconfiguration \\
Configuration of candidate target SpCell(s) and execution condition(s) for conditional handover, conditional PSCell addition or conditional PSCell change. The field is absent if any DAPS bearer is configured or if the masterCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync. For conditional PSCell change, the field is absent if the secondaryCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync. The RRCReconfiguration message contained in DLinformation TransferMRDC cannot contain the field conditionalReconfiguration for conditional PSCell change and conditional PSCell addition.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
daps-SourceRelease \\
Indicates to UE that the source cell part of DAPS operation is to be stopped and the source cell part of DAPS configuration is to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dedicatedNAS-MessageList \\
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for each PDU in the list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dedicatedPagingDelivery \\
This field is used to transfer Paging message to the L2 Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dedicatedPosSysinfoDelivery \\
This field is used to transfer SIBPos to the UE in RRC_CONNECTED.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dedicatedSIB1-Delivery \\
This field is used to transfer SIB1 to the UE. The field has the same values as the corresponding configuration in serving CellConfigCommon.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dedicatedSysteminformationDelivery \\
This field is used to transfer SIB6, SIB7, SIB8 to the UE with an active BWP with no common serach space configured. For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, this field is used to transfer the SIBs requested on-demand.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID \\
This field is used for IAB-node to configure the default uplink Routing ID, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IABMT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes. This field is mandatory only for IAB-node bootstrapping.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel \\
This field is used for IAB-nodes to configure the default uplink BH RLC channel, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IAB-MT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes, and the new IP address is anchored at a different IAB-donor-DU. This field is mandatory for IAB-node bootstrapping. If the IAB-MT is operating in EN-DC, the default uplink BH RLC channel is referring to an RLC channel on the SCG; Otherwise, it is referring to an RLC channel on the MCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
flowControlFeedbackType \\
This field is only used for IAB-node that support hop-by-hop flow control to configure the type of flow control feedback. Value perBH-RLC-Channel indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback per BH RLC channel, value perRoutingID indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback per routing ID, and value both indicates that the IAB-node shall provide flow control feedback both per BH RLC channel and per routing ID.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fullConfig \\
Indicates that the full configuration option is applicable for the RRCReconfiguration message for intra-system intra-RAT HO. For inter-RAT HO from E-UTRA to NR, fullConfig indicates whether or not delta signalling of SDAP/PDCP from source RAT is applicable. This field is absent if any DAPS bearer is configured or when the RRCReconfiguration message is transmitted on SRB3, and in an RRCReconfiguration message for SCG contained in another RRCReconfiguration message (or RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, see TS 36.331 [10]) transmitted on SRB1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-IP-Address \\
This field is used to provide the IP address information for IAB-node.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-IP-Addressindex \\
This field is used to identify a configuration of an IP address.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-IP-Address ToAddModList \\
List of IP addresses allocated for IAB-node to be added and modified.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
