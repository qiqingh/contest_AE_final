3> for each applicable cell which measurement results are available, include an entry in the measResultCellListSFTD-NR and set the contents as follows:
\( 4> \) set physCellld to the physical cell identity of the concerned NR neighbour cell.
\( 4> \) set sfn-OffsetResult and frameBoundaryOffsetResult to the measurement results provided by lower layers;
\( 4> \) if the reportRSRP is set to true:
\( 5> \) set \( r s r p \)-Result to the RSRP of the concerned cell derived based on SSB;
\( 1> \) else if the corresponding measObject concerns E-UTRA:
\( 2> \) if the reportSFTD-Meas is set to true within the corresponding reportConfigInterRAT for this measId:
\( 3> \) set the measResultSFTD-EUTRA in accordance with the following:

\( 1> \) if PDCP excess delay measurements are available:
\( 2> \) set the \( u \) /-PDCP-ExcessDelayResultList to include the corresponding PDCP excess delay measurements;
\( 1> \) if the includeCommonLocationInfo is configured in the corresponding reportConfig for this measId and detailed location information that has not been reported is available, set the content of commonLocationInfo of the locationInfo as follows:

\( 2> \) if available, include the gnss-TOD-msec,
\( 1> \) if the includeWLAN-Meas is configured in the corresponding reportConfig for this measld, set the wlanLocationInfo of the locationInfo in the measResults as follows:
\( 2> \) if available, include the \( \log M e a s R e s u l t W L A N \), in order of decreasing RSSI for WLAN APs;
\( 1> \) if the includeBT-Meas is configured in the corresponding reportConfig for this measld, set the BT-LocationInfo of the locationInfo in the measResults as follows:
\( 2> \) if available, include the \( \log M e a s R e s u l t B T \), in order of decreasing RSSI for Bluetooth beacons;
\( 1> \) if the includeSensor-Meas is configured in the corresponding reportConfig for this measld, set the sensorLocationInfo of the locationInfo in the measResults as follows:
\( 2> \) if available, include the sensor-MeasurementInformation;
\( 2> \) if available, include the sensor-MotionInformation;
\( 1> \) if there is at least one applicable transmission resource pool for NR sidelink communication (for measResultsSL):
