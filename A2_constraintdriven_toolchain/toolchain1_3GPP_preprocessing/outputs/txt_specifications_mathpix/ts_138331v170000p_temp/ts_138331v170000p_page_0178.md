\( 5> \) perform the RSSI and channel occupancy measurements on the frequency indicated in the associated measObject;
\( 2> \) if the reportType for the associated reportConfig is set to reportSFTD and the numberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld is less than one:
\( 3> \) if the reportSFTD-Meas is set to true:
4 if the measObject is associated to E-UTRA:
\( 5> \) perform SFTD measurements between the PCell and the E-UTRA PSCell;
\( 5> \) if the reportRSRP is set to true;
\( 6> \) perform RSRP measurements for the E-UTRA PSCell;

\( 2> \) perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in 5.5.4, except if reportConfig is condTriggerConfig-

NOTE 1: The evaluation of conditional reconfiguration execution criteria is specified in 5.3 .5 .13 .
The UE capable of Rx-Tx time difference measurement when configured with measObjectRxTxDiff shall:
1> perform the corresponding Rx -Tx time difference measurements associated with downlink reference signals indicated in the concerned measObjectRxTxDiff-

The UE capable of CBR measurement when configured to transmit NR sidelink communication shall:
\( 1> \) If the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in slConfig DedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12:
