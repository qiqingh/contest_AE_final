\( 4> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the pool of resources indicated by sl-RxPool in SIB12;
\( 2> \) else:
3> configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the pool of resources that were preconfigured by \( s \)-RxPool in SL-Preconfiguration NR, as defined in clause 9.3;
5.8.8 Sidelink communication transmission

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication and has related data to be transmitted shall:
\( 1> \) if the conditions for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in 5.8.2 are met:
\( 2> \) if the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in \( s \) /-FreqInfoToAddModList in \( s \) ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12:
\( 3> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and uses the frequency included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message:

4> if the UE is configured with \( s \)-ScheduledConfig:
\( 5> \) if T310 for MCG or T311 is running; and if \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional is included in sl-FreqInfoList for the concerned frequency in SIB12 or included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR in RRCReconfiguration; or

5> if T301 is running and the cell on which the UE initiated RRC connection re-establishment provides SIB12 including sl-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency; or
\( 5> \) if T304 for MCG is running and the UE is configured with \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional included in \( s l \) ConfigDedicatedNR for the concerned frequency in RRCReconfiguration:

6> configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 2 based on random selection using the pool of resources indicated by sl-TxPoolExceptional as defined in TS 38.321 [3];
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 1 for NR sidelink communication;

5> if T311 is running, configure the lower layers to release the resources indicated by rrcConfiguredSidelinkGrant (if any);

4- if the UE is configured with sl-UE-SelectedConfig:
\( 5> \) if a result of sensing on the resources configured in \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration is not available in accordance with TS 38.214 [19];
\( 6> \) if sl-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency is included in RRCReconfiguration; or
6> if the PCell provides SIB12 including sl-TxPoolExceptional in sl-FreqInfoList for the concerned frequency:
\( 7> \) configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 2 based on random selection using the pool of resources indicated by sl-TxPoolExceptional as defined in TS 38.321 [3];
\( 5> \) else, if the \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal and/or \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormalPS for the concerned frequency is included in the \( s \)-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
