\hline MeasResuits field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
excessDelay \\
Indicates the ratio of packets in UL per DRB exceeding the configured delay threshold among the UL PDCP SDUs, according to the UL PDCP Excess Packet Delay per DRB mapping table, as defined in TS 38.314 [53], Table 4.3.1.e-1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measid \\
Identifies the measurement identity for which the reporting is being performed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measQuantityResuits \\
The value sinr is not included when it is used for LogMeasReport-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultCellListSFTD-NR \\
SFTD measurement results between the PCell and the NR neighbour cell(s) in NR standalone.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResuItCLI \\
CLI measurement results.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultEUTRA \\
Measured results of an E-UTRA cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultForRSSI \\
Includes measured RSSI result in dBm (see TS 38.215 [9]) and channelOccupancy which is the percentage of samples when the RSSI was above the configured channelOccupancyThreshold for the associated reportConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultListEUTRA \\
List of measured results for the maximum number of reported best cells for an E-UTRA measurement identity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultListNR \\
List of measured results for the maximum number of reported best cells for an NR measurement identity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultListUTRA-FDD \\
List of measured results for the maximum number of reported best cells for a UTRA-FDD measurement identity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultNR \\
Measured results of an NR cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultServFreqListEUTRA-SCG \\
Measured results of the E-UTRA SCG serving frequencies: the measurement result of PSCell and each SCell, if any, and of the best neighbouring cell on each E-UTRA SCG serving frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultServFreqListNR-SCG \\
Measured results of the NR SCG serving frequencies: the measurement result of PSCell and each SCell, if any, and of the best neighbouring cell on each NR SCG serving frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultServingMOList \\
Measured results of measured cells with reference signals indicated in the serving cell measurement objects including measurement results of SpCell, configured SCell(s) and best neighbouring cell within measured cells with reference signals indicated in on each serving cell measurement object. If the sending of the MeasurementReport message is triggered by a measurement configured by the field si-ConfigDedicatedForNR received within an E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message (i.e. CBR measurements), this field is not applicable and its contents is ignored by the network.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultSFTD-EUTRA \\
SFTD measurement results between the PCell and the E-UTRA PScell in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultSFTD-NR \\
SFTD measurement results between the PCell and the NR PScell in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultsSL \\
CBR measurements results for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultUTRA-FDD \\
Measured result of a UTRA-FDD cell.
