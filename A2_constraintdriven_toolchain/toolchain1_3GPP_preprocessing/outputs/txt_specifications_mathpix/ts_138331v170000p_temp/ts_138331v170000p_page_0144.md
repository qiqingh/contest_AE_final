\( 2> \) perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the selected Access Category and one or more Access [dentities to be applied as specified in TS 24.501 [23];
\( 3> \) if the access attempt is barred:
\( 4> \) set the variable pending \( R N A \)-Update to true;
\( 4> \) the procedure ends;
NOTE 2: In case the L2 U2N Relay UE initiates RRC connection resume according to conditions as specified in 5.3.13.1a, the L2 U2N Relay UE sets the resume Cause by implementation. If the cause value in the message received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 is emergency, mps-PriorityAccess, or mcsPriorityAccess, the L2 U2N Relay UE can set the same value. Otherwise, the L2 U2N Relay UE does not set the value as emergency, mps-PriorityAccess, or mcs-PriorityAccess.
\( 1> \) if the UE is in NE-DC or NR-DC:
\( 2> \) if the UE does not support maintaining SCG configuration upon connection resumption:
\( 3> \) release the MR-DC related configurations (ie., as specified in 5.3 .5 .10 ) from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) if the UE does not support maintaining the MCG SCell configurations upon connection resumption:
\( 2> \) release the MCG SCell(s) from the UE [nactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) if the UE performs connection resumption in a different cell than the cell where srs-PosRRC-InactiveConfig was configured;
\( 2> \) release srs-PosRRC-InactiveConfig, if configured;
Editor's Note: This agreement/clause may not be needed because we have this agreement TA timer configuration is invalidated upon any cell reselection; see 5.7.15.
\( 1> \) if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via PC5-RRC connection (ie the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) apply the default configuration of SL-RLC1 as defined in 9.2 .4 for SRB1;
\( 2> \) apply the default PDCP configuration defined in 9.2.1 for SRB1;
\( 1> \) else:
\( 2> \) apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications, except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIBI;
\( 2> \) apply the default SRB1 configuration as specified in 9.2.1;
\( 2> \) apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
\( 1> \) release delayBudgetReportingConfig from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) stop timer T342, if running;
\( 1> \) release overheatingAssistanceConfig from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) stop timer T345, if running;
\( 1> \) release idc-AssistanceConfig from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) release \( d r x \)-PreferenceConfig for all configured cell groups from the UE [nactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) stop all instances of timer T346a, if running;
\( 1> \) release \( \max B W \)-PreferenceConfig for all configured cell groups from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 1> \) stop all instances of timer T346b, if running;
\( 1> \) release maxCC-PreferenceConfig for all configured cell groups from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
