\( 4> \) if the UE is (capable of) acting as U2N Relay UE, and if SIB12 includes sl-RelayUE-ConfigCommon, and if the U2N Relay UE threshold conditions as specified in 5.8.14.2 are met; or

4- if the UE is selecting a U2N Relay UE / has a selected U2N Relay UE, and if SIB 12 includes s/-RemoteUE-ConfigCommon, and if the U2N Remote UE threshold conditions as specified in 5.8.15.2 are met:
\( 5> \) initiate transmission of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message to indicate the NR sidelink relay discovery announcements resources required by the UE in accordance with 5.8.3.3;
\( 2> \) else:
3> if the last transmission of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message included \( s \) /-TxResourceReqListDisc:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message to indicate it no longer requires NR sidelink relay discovery announcements resources in accordance with 5.8.3.3;
5.8.3.3 Actions related to transmission of SidelinkUEInformationNR message

The UE shall set the contents of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the UE initiates the procedure to indicate it is (no more) interested to receive NR sidelink communication or to request (configuration/release) of NR sidelink communication transmission resources or to report to the network that a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure has been declared or to report to the network the sidelink DRX configuration for NR sidelink unicast communication or to report to the network the sidelink DRX assistance information for NR sidelink unicast communication or to report the Destination Layer-2 ID and QoS profile associated with its interested services that sidelink DRX is applied for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication or to indicate it is (no more) interested to receive NR sidelink discovery announcements or to request (configuration/release) of NR sidelink discovery announcements transmission resources or to request (configuration/ release) of NR sidelink U2N relay communication transmission resources (i.e. UE includes all concerned information, irrespective of what triggered the procedure):
\( 2> \) if SIB12 including sl-ConfigCommonNR is provided by the PCell:
\( 3> \) if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink communication:
4 include \( s \)-RxInterestedFreqList and set it to the frequency for NR sidelink communication reception;
4> include \( s l \)-RxDRX-ReportList and set its fields (if needed) as follows for each destination for which it reports to network:
\( 5> \) if \( s \)-DRX-ConfigCommon-GC-BC is included in SIB12-IEs:
\( 6> \) set sl-DRX-ConfigFromTx to include the accepted sidelink DRX configuration of the associated destination, if received from the associated peer UE;

6> set sl-RxInterestedQoS-InfoList to include the QoS profile of its interested service for the associated destination for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication;

3> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication:
4> include \( s l \)-TxResourceReqList and set its fields (if needed) as follows for each destination for which it requests network to assign NR sidelink communication resource:
\( 5> \) set \( s \)-DestinationIdentity to the destination identity configured by upper layer for NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 5> \) set \( s l \)-CastType to the cast type of the associated destination identity configured by the upper layer for the NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 5> \) set \( s i \)-RLC-Modelndication to include the RLC mode(s) and optionally QoS profile(s) of the sidelink QoS flow(s) of the associated RLC mode(s), if the associated bi-directional sidelink DRB has been established due to the configuration by RRCReconfigurationSidelink;
