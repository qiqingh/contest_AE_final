Figure 5.3.13.1-3: RRC connection resume followed by network release, successful

Figure 5.3.13.1-4: RRC connection resume followed by network suspend, successful

Figure 5.3.13.1-5: RRC connection resume, network reject

The purpose of this procedure is to resume a suspended RRC connection, including resuming \( \mathrm{SRB}(\mathrm{s}), \mathrm{DRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) and multicast MRB(s) or perform an RNA update. This procedure is also used to initiate SDT in RRC_INACTIVE.
5.3.13.1a Conditions for resuming RRC Connection for NR sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication

For NR sidelink communication/discovery an RRC connection is resumed only in the following cases:
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery and related data is available for transmission:
\( 2> \) if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in \( s l \) FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency; or
\( 2> \) if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink discovery is included in \( s l \) FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-DiscTxPoolSelected or sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency;

For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_INACTIVE, an RRC connection establishment is resumed in the following cases:
1> if any message is received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;

For V2X sidelink communication an RRC connection resume is initiated only when the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS 36.331 [10] are met.
