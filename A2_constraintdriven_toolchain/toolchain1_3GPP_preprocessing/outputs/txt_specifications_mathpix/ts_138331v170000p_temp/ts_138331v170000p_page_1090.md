targetCellidentity \\
An input variable used to calculate the shortMAC-I. Set to the cellidentity of the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-Identity/nfoList broadcasted in SIB1 of the target cell i.e. the cell the UE is trying to reestablish the connection.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
source-c-RNTI \\
Set to C-RNTI that the UE had in the PCell it was connected to prior to the reestablishment.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourcePhysCellid \\
Set to the physical cell identity of the PCell the UE was connected to prior to the reestablishment.
