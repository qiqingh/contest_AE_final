\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofHARQ-BundlingGroups \\
Indicates the number of HARQ bundling groups for type2 HARQ-ACK codebook.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pathlossReferenceLinking \\
Indicates whether UE shall apply as pathloss reference either the downlink of SpCell (PCell for MCG or PSCell for SCG) or of SCell that corresponds with this uplink (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-ServingCellConfig \\
PDSCH related parameters that are not BWP-specific.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rateMatchPatternToAddModList \\
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the rate match patterns. Rate match patterns defined here on cell level apply only to PDSCH of the same numerology. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sCellDeactivationTimer \\
SCell deactivation timer in TS 38.321 [3]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value infinity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
semiStaticChannelAccessConfigUE \\
When this field is configured and when channelAccessMode-r16 (see IE ServingCellConfigCommon and IE ServingCellConfigCommonSIB) is configured to semiStatic, the UE operates in semi-static channel access mode and can initiate a channel occupancy periodically (see TS 37.213 [48], Clause 4.3). \\
The period can be configured independently from period configured in SemiStaticChannelAccessConfig-r16 if the UE indicates the corresponding capability. Otherwise, the periodicity configured by periodUE-r17 is an integer multiple of or an integter factor of the periodicity indicated by period in SemiStaticChannelAccessConfig-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servingCellMO \\
measObjectld of the MeasObjectNR in MeasConfig which is associated to the serving cell. For this MeasObjectNR, the following relationship applies between this MeasObjectNR and frequency/nfoDL in ServingCellConfigCommon of the serving cell: if ssbFrequency is configured, its value is the same as the absoluteFrequencySSB and if csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility is configured, the value of its subcarrierSpacing is present in one entry of the scs-SpecificCarrierList, csi-RS-CellListMobility includes an entry corresponding to the serving cell (with celld equal to physCelld in ServingCellConfigCommon) and the frequency range indicated by the csi-rs-MeasurementBW of the entry in csi-RS-CellListMobility is included in the frequency range indicated by in the entry of the scs-SpecificCarrierList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
supplementaryUplink \\
Network may configure this field only when supplementaryUplinkConfig is configured in ServingCellConfigCommon or supplementaryUplink is configured in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
supplementaryUplinkRelease \\
If this field is included, the UE shall release the uplink configuration configured by supplementaryUplink. The network only includes either supplementaryUplinkRelease or supplementaryUplink at a time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tag-ld \\
Timing Advance Group ID, as specified in TS 38.321 [3], which this cell belongs to.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tci-Info \\
If configured for an SCell, or if configured for the PSCell when the SCG is being activated upon the reception of the containing message, the UE shall consider the indicated TCI states as the activated TCI states for PDCCH/PDSCH reception on this serving cell. \\
If configured for the PSCell when the SCG is indicated as deactivated in the containing message: \\
- the UE shall consider the indicated TCI states as the TCI states to be activated for PDCCH/PDSCH reception upon a later SCG activation in which tci-Info is absent \\
- if bfd-and-RLM is configured and no RS is configured in RadioLinkMonitoringConfig for RLM, respectively for BFD, the UE shall use the indicated TCI states for PDCCH as RS for RLM, respectively for BFD. \\
When this field is absent for the PSCell and the SCG is being deactivated: \\
- the UE shall consider the previously activated TCI states as the TCI states to be activated for PDCCH/PDSCH reception upon a later SCG activation in which tci-Info is absent \\
- if bfd-and-RLM is configured and no RS is configured in RadioLinkMonitoringConfig for RLM, respectively for BFD, the UE shall use the previously activated TCI states for PDCCH as RS for RLM, respectively for BFD.
