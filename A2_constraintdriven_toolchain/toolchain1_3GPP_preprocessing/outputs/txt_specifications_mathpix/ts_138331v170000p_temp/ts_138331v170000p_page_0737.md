\hline 2StepOnlyNoCFRA & The field is mandatory present if RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is included in the RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA and there are no 4-step random access configurations configured in the BWP (i.e only 2-step random access type configured in the BWP), otherwise (i.e. 4-step random access configuration also exists in the BWP) the field is optionally present, Need S. When RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is included in the RACH-ConfigDedicated, this field is absent. \\
\hline NoCFRA & The field is mandatory present if msgB-ResponseWindow-r17 is absent and RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is not included in CFRA-TwoStep in RACH-ConfigDedicated, otherwise the field is absent, Need S. \\
\hline NoCFRA2 & The field is mandatory present if msgB-ResponseWindow-r16 is absent and RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is not included in CFRA-TwoStep in RACH-ConfigDedicated, otherwise the field is absent, Need S. \\

RA-Prioritization field descriptions
powerRampingStepHighPrioritiy
Power ramping step applied for prioritized random access procedure.
scalingFactorBI
Scaling factor for the backoff indicator (BI) for the prioritized random access procedure. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.4). Value zero corresponds to 0 , value dot25 corresponds to 0.25 and so on.
