\( 3> \) for the concerned SI message, determine the number \( n \) which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by posSchedulingInfoList in SIBI;
\( 3> \) determine the integer value \( x=m \times w+(n-1) \times w \), where \( w \) is the si-WindowLength;
\( 3> \) the SI-window starts at the slot \( \# a \), where \( a=x \bmod \mathrm{~N} \), in the radio frame for which SFN \( \bmod T= \) FLOOR \( (x / \mathrm{N})+8 \), where \( T \) is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 1> \) receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e SI-RNTI in the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in time is given by si-WindowLength, or until the SI message was received;
\( 1> \) if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the current modification period;

NOTE 1: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located.

NOTE 2: The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.

NOTE 3: If the concerned SI message was not received in the current modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE implementation.

NOTE 4: A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may stop the PDCCH monitoring during the SI window for the concerned \( S I \) message when the requested \( S I B(s) \) are acquired.

NOTE 5: A UE capable of NR sidelink communication and configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication on a frequency, may acquire SIB12 or SystemInformationBlockType 28 from a cell other than current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED), if SIB12 of current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED) does not provide configuration for NR sidelink communication for the frequency, and if the other cell providing configuration for NR sidelink communication for the frequency meets the S-criteria as defined in TS 38.304 [20] or TS 36.304 [27].
\( 1> \) perform the actions for the acquired SI message as specified in clause 5.2.2.4.
5.2.2.3.3 Request for on demand system information

The UE shall, while T319a is not running:
\( 1> \) if SIBI includes si-SchedulingInfo containing si-RequestConfigSUL and criteria to select supplementary uplink as defined in TS 38.321[13], clause 5.1.1 is met:
\( 2> \) trigger the lower layer to initiate the Random Access procedure on supplementary uplink in accordance with [3] using the PRACH preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in si-RequestConfigSUL corresponding to the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:
\( 3> \) acquire the requested \( S I \) message( \( s \) ) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> else if SIBI includes si-SchedulingInfo containing si-RequestConfig and criteria to select normal uplink as defined in TS 38.321 [13], clause 5.1.1 is met:
\( 2> \) trigger the lower layer to initiate the random access procedure on normal uplink in accordance with TS 38.321 [3] using the PRACH preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in si-RequestConfig corresponding to the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:
