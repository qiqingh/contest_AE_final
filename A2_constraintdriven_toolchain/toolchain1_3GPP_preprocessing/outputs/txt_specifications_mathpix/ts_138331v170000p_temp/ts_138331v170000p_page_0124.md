\( 1> \) if the cell selection is triggered by detecting radio link failure of the MCG or re-configuration with sync failure of the MCG or mobility from NR failure, and
\( 1> \) if attemptCondReconfig is configured; and
1> if the selected cell is one of the candidate cells for which the reconfigurationWithSync is included in the masterCellGroup in VarConditionalReconfig:
\( 2> \) set the choCellld in the VarRLF-Report to the global cell identity and tracking area code, if available, otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the selected cell;
\( 2> \) apply the stored condRRCReconfig associated to the selected cell and perform actions as specified in 5.3.5.3;
NOTE 1: It is left to network implementation to how to avoid keystream reuse in case of CHO based recovery after a failed handover without key change.
