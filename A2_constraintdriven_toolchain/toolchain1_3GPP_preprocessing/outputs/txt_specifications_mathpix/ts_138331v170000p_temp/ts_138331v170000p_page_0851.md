- UAC-BarringInfoSetList

The IE UAC-BarringInfoSetList provides a list of access control parameter sets. An access category can be configured with access parameters according to one of the sets.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UAC-BarringinfoSetList field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uac-BarringinfoSetList \\
List of access control parameter sets. Each access category can be configured with access parameters corresponding to a particular set by uac-barringinfoSetindex. \\
Association of an access category with an index that has no corresponding entry in the uac-Barring/nfoSetList is valid configuration and indicates no barring.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uac-BarringForAccessidentity \\
Indicates whether access attempt is allowed for each Access Identity. The leftmost bit, bit 0 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 1, bit 1 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 2, bit 2 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 11, bit 3 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 12, bit 4 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 13, bit 5 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 14, and bit 6 in the bit string corresponds to Access Identity 15. Value 0 means that access attempt is allowed for the corresponding access identity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uac-BarringFactor \\
Represents the probability that access attempt would be allowed during access barring check.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uac-BarringFactorForAI3 \\
Barring factor applicable for Access Identity 3. Represents the probability that access attempt would be allowed during access barring check. If absent, the UE considers the access attempt as allowed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uac-BarringTime \\
The average time in seconds before a new access attempt is to be performed after an access attempt was barred at access barring check for the same access category, see 5.3.14.5.
\end{tabular} \\
