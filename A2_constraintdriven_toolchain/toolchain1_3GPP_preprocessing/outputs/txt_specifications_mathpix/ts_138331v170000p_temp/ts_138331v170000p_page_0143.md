ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

NOTE: Upper layers initiate an RRC connection resume. The interaction with NAS is left to UE implementation.
5.3.13.1b Conditions for initiating SDT

AUE in RRC_INACTIVE initiates the resume procedure for SDT when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
\( 1> \) the upper layers request resumption of RRC connection; and
1> SIBl includes sat-ConfigCommon; and
\( 1> \) sdt-Config is configured; and \( 1> \) all the pending data in UL is mapped to the radio bearers configured for SDT; and

1> lower layers indicate that conditions for initiating SDT as specified in TS 38.321 [3] are fulfilled.
5.3.13.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers or AS (when responding to RAN paging, upon triggering RNA updates while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, for NR sidelink communication/V2X sidelink communication as specified in clause 5-3.13.1a) requests the resume of a suspended RRC connection or for initiating SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.1b.

The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this procedure.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered by response to NG-RAN paging:
\( 2> \) select ' 0 ' as the Access Category;
\( 2> \) perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the selected Access Category and one or more Access Identities provided by upper layers;
\( 3> \) if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
\( 1> \) else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered by upper layers:
\( 2> \) if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more Access Identities:
\( 3> \) perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper layers;

4> if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
\( 2> \) if the resumption occurs after release with redirect with mpsPriorityIndication:
3> set the resumeCause to mps-PriorityAccess;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) set the resumeCause in accordance with the information received from upper layers;
\( 1> \) else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered due to an RNA update as specified in 5.3.13.8:
\( 2> \) if an emergency service is ongoing:
NOTE 1: How the RRC layer in the UE is aware of an ongoing emergency service is up to UE implementation.
3> select '2' as the Access Category;
3> set the resumeCause to emergency;
2> else:
\( 3> \) select ' 8 ' as the Access Category;
