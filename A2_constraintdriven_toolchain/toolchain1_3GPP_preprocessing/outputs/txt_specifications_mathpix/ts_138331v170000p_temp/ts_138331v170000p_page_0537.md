\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofReportedRS \\
The number (N) of measured RS resources to be reported per report setting in a non-group-based report. N <= N_max, where N_max is either 2 or 4 depending on UE capability. \\
(see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4) When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Mode1 \\
Configures the number of reported X CSIs when csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode 1' as described in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2. The field is present only if csi-ReportMode configures Mode 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference \\
NZP CSI RS resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfig/d of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CS/-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only NZP-CSI-RS resources. The bwp-ld in that CSI-ResourceConfig is the same value as the bwp-ld in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p0alpha \\
Index of the p0-alpha set determining the power control for this CSI report transmission (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-BundieSizeForCSI \\
PRB bundling size to assume for CQI calculation when reportQuantity is CRI/RI/i1/CQI. If the field is absent, the UE assumes that no PRB bundling is applied (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pmi-Formatindicator \\
Indicates whether the UE shall report a single (wideband) or multiple (subband) PMI. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-CSI-ResourceList \\
Indicates which PUCCH resource to use for reporting on PUCCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportConfigType \\
Time domain behavior of reporting configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportFreqConfiguration \\
Reporting configuration in the frequency domain. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportQuantity \\
The CSI related quantities to report. see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1. If the field reportQuantity-r16 is present, UE shall ignore reportQuantity (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportSlotConfig \\
Periodicity and slot offset (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). If the field reportSlotConfig-v1530 is present, the UE shall ignore the value provided in reportSlotConfig (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportSlotOffsetList, reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1, reportSIotOffsetListDCI-0-2 \\
Timing offset Y for semi persistent reporting using PUSCH. This field lists the allowed offset values. This list must have the same number of entries as the puschTimeDomainAllocationList in PUSCH-Config. A particular value is indicated in DCI. The network indicates in the DCI field of the UL grant, which of the configured report slot offsets the UE shall apply. The DCI value 0 corresponds to the first report slot offset in this list, the DCI value 1 corresponds to the second report slot offset in this list, and so on. The first report is transmitted in slot \( \mathrm{n}+\mathrm{Y} \), second report in \( \mathrm{n}+\mathrm{Y}+\mathrm{P} \), where P is the configured periodicity. \\
Timing offset Y for aperiodic reporting using PUSCH. This field lists the allowed offset values. This list must have the same number of entries as the puschTimeDomainAllocationList in PUSCH-Config. A particular value is indicated in DCI. The network indicates in the DCI field of the UL grant, which of the configured report slot offsets the UE shall apply. The DCI value 0 corresponds to the first report slot offset in this list, the DCI value 1 corresponds to the second report slot offset in this list, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1). \\
The field reportSiotOffsetListDCI-0-1 applies to DCI format 0 1 and the field reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2 applies to DCI format 0 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourcesForChanneIMeasurement \\
Resources for channel measurement. csi-ResourceConfig/d of a CSS-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only NZP-CSI-RS resources and/or SSB resources. This CSI-ReportConfig is associated with the DL BWP indicated by bwpId in that CSI-ResourceConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sharedCMR \\
Enables sharing of channel measurement resources between different CSI measurement hypotheses when (1) csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode1' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSIMode1 is set to 1 or 2; or (2) csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode2' (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
