\( 2> \) determine the sorting quantity according to reportQuantityCell for an NR cell, and according to reportQuantity for an E-UTRA cell, as below:
\( 3> \) if a single quantity is set to true:
4> consider this quantity as the sorting quantity;
3> else:
\( 4> \) if rsrp is set to true;
\( 5> \) consider RSRP as the sorting quantity;
4> else:
\( 5> \) consider RSRQ as the sorting quantity;
\( 2> \) determine the sorting quantity according to reportQuantityUTRA-FDD for UTRA-FDD cell, as below:
\( 3> \) if a single quantity is set to true:
4> consider this quantity as the sorting quantity;
3> else:
\( 4> \) consider RSCP as the sorting quantity.
\( 2> \) for a candidate L2 U2N Relay UE, consider the reportQuantityRelay as the sorting quantity;

5.5.6.1 General

Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication

The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR (eutra-RSTD, \( n r \)-RSTD, \( n r \)-UE-RxTxTimeDiff, \( n r \)-PRS-RSRP) which require measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards E-UTRA (eutra-FineTimingDetection) which requires measurement gaps. UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.

NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
5.5.6.2 Initiation

The UE shall:
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or start subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA, and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
\( 2> \) if preconfigured measurement gaps are configured and the UE considers that at least one of the preconfigured gaps meets the measurement gap requirements:

Editor's Note: check if Reference for TS 38.133 on measurement gap requirements is needed.
