5.3.13.5 Handling of failure to resume RRC Connection

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if timer T319 expires:
\( 2> \) if the UE has connection establishment failure information or connection resume failure information available in VarConnEstFailReport and if the RPLMN is not equal to plmn-identity stored in VarConnEstFailReport; or
\( 2> \) if the cell identity of current cell is not equal to the cell identity stored in measResultFailedCell in VarConnEstFailReport:
\( 3> \) reset the numberOfConnFail to 0;
\( 2> \) if the UE has connection establishment failure informaton or connection resume failure information available in VarConnEstFailReportList and if the RPLMN is not equal to plmn-identity stored in VarConnEstFailReportList:
\( 3> \) clear the content included in VarConnEstFailReportList;
\( 2> \) clear the content included in VarConnEstFailReport except for the numberOfConnFail, if any;
\( 2> \) store the following connection resume failure information in the VarConnEstFailReport by setting its fields as follows:
\( 3> \) set the plmn-Identity to the PLMN selected by upper layers (see TS 24.501 [23]) from the PLMN(s) included in the plmn-IdentitylnfoList in SIB1;
\( 3> \) set the measResultFailedCell to include the global cell identity, tracking area code, the cell level and SS/PBCH block level RSRP, and RSRQ, and SS/PBCH block indexes, of the failed cell based on the available SSB measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected connection resume failure;
\( 3> \) if available, set the measResultNeighCells, in order of decreasing ranking-criterion as used for cell reselection, to include neighbouring cell measurements for at most the following number of neighbouring cells: 6 intra-frequency and 3 inter-frequency neighbours per frequency as well as 3 inter-RAT neighbours, per frequency/ set of frequencies per RAT and according to the following:

4 for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are available;
NOTE: The UE includes the latest results of the available measurements as used for cell reselection evaluation, which are performed in accordance with the performance requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\( 3> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7;
\( 3> \) set perRAInfoList to indicate the performed random access procedure related information as specified in 5.7.10.5;
\( 3> \) if numberOfConnFail is smaller than 8 :
\( 4> \) increment the numberOfConnFail by 1;
\( 2> \) if the UE supports multiple CEF report:
3> if the cgi-Info in the measResultFailedCell in the newly added VarConnEstFailReport is the same as the cgi-Info in the measResultFailedCell in the last entry in the VarConnEstFailReportList:
\( 4> \) except for the numberOfConnFail, replace all information elements for the enty with the VarConnEstFailReport:
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) if the maxCEFReport-r 17 has not been reached:
