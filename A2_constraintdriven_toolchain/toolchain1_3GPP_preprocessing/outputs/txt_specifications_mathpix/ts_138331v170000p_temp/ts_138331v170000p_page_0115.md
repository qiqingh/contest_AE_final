1> if the UE was in RRC_CONNECTED and the SCG was activated before receiving the message for which this procedure is initiated:

2 if SRB3 was configured before the reception of the RRCReconfiguration or of the RRCConnectionReconfiguration and SRB3 is not to be released according to any RadioBearerConfig included in the RRCReconfiguration or in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331[10]:

3> trigger the PDCP entity of SRB3 to perform SDU discard as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
3> re-establish the RLC entity of SRB3 as specified in TS 38.322 [4].
5.3.5.13c FR2 UL gap configuration

The UE shall:
1> if ul-GapFR2-Config is set to setup:
\( 2> \) if an FR2 UL gap configuration is already setup, release the FR2 UL gap configuration;
\( 2> \) setup the FR2 UL gap configuration indicated by the ul-GapFR2-Config in accordance with the received gapOffset, i.e., the first subframe of each gap occurs at an SFN and subframe meeting the following condition:

SFN mod T = FLOOR (gapOffse/10);
if the UGRP is larger than 5 ms :
subframe \( = \) gapOffset \( \bmod 10 \);
else:
subframe \( = \) gapOffset or \( ( \) gapOffset +5\( ) \);
with \( \mathrm{T}=\mathrm{CEIL}(\mathrm{UGRP} / 10) \).
\( 1> \) else if ul-GapFR2-Config is set to release:
\( 2> \) release the FR2 UL gap configuration.
NOTE 1: For \( u \)-GapFR2-Config configuration with synchronous CA, the SFN and subframe of a serving cell on FR2 frequency is used in the gap calculation. For ul-GapFR2-Config configuration with asynchronous CA, the SFN and subframe of a serving cell on FR2 frequency indicated by the refFR2ServCellAsyncCA in ul-GapFR2-Config is used in the gap calculation.
5.3.5.13d Application layer measurement configuration

The UE shall:
1> if measConfigAppLayerToAddReleaseList is included in appLayerMeasConfig within RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume:
\( 2> \) for each measConfigAppLayerId value included in the measConfigAppLayerToReleaseList:
3> forward the measConfigAppLayerId and inform upper layers about the release of the application layer measurement configuration including any RAN visible configuration;
\( 3> \) discard any received application layer measurement report received from upper layers;
3> consider itself not to be configured to send application layer measurement report for the measConfigAppLayerId.

1> if measConfigAppLayerToAddModList is included in appLayerMeasConfig within RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume:
\( 2> \) for each measConfigAppLayerId value included in the measConfigAppLayerToAddModList:
