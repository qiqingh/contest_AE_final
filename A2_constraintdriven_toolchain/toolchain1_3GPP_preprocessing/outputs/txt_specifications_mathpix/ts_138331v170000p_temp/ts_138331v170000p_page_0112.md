1> perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation as specified in 5.3.5.13.4;
5.3.5.13.4 Conditional reconfiguration evaluation

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each condReconfigld within the VarConditionalReconfig:
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration within condRRCReconfig includes the masterCellGroup including the reconfigurationWithSync, consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value indicated in the ServingCellConfigCommon included in the reconfigurationWithSync within the masterCellGroup in the received condRRCReconfig to be applicable cell;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration within condRRCReconfig includes the secondaryCellGroup including the reconfigurationWithSync, consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value indicated in the ServingCellConfigCommon included in the reconfigurationWithSync within the secondaryCellGroup within the received condRRCReconfig to be applicable cell;
\( 2> \) if condExecutionCondSCG is configured:
\( 3> \) in the remainder of the procedures, consider each measId indicated in the condExecutionCondSCG as a measId in the VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig;
\( 2> \) if condExecutionCond is configured:
3> if it is configured via SRB3 or configured within \( n r \)-SCG or within \( n r \)-SecondaryCellGroupConfig (specified in TS 36.331 [10]) via SRB1:

4> in the remainder of the procedures, consider each measId indicated in the condExecutionCond as a measId in the VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig;

3> otherwise:
4> in the remainder of the procedures, consider each measId indicated in the condExecutionCond as a measId in the VarMeasConfig associated with the MCG measConfig;
\( 2> \) for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig indicated in the condExecutionCond or condExecutionCondSCG associated to condReconfigld:

3> if the condEventld is associated with condEventT1, and if the entry condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigld, i.e. the event corresponding with the condEventId(s) of the corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells; or
\( 3> \) if the condEventld is associated with condEventD1, and if the entry condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigld, i.e. the event corresponding with the condEventId(s) of the corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarConditionalReconfig; or
\( 3> \) if the condEventld is associated with condEventA3, condEventA4 or condEventA5, and if the entry condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigld, i.e. the event corresponding with the condEventId(s) of the corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarConditionalReconfig:

4> consider the event associated to that measId to be fulfilled;
3> if the measId for this event associated with the condReconfigId has been modified; or
3> if the condEventld is associated with condEventT1, and if the leaving condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigId, i.e. the event corresponding with the condEventId(s) of the corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells; or
\( 3> \) if the condEventld is associated with condEventD1, and if the leaving condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigId, i.e. the event corresponding with the condEventId(s) of the
