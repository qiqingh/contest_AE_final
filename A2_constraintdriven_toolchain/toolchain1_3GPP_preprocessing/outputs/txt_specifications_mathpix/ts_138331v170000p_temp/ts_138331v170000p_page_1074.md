\hline T310 & Upon detecting physical layer problems for the SpCell i.e. upon receiving N310 consecutive out-ofsync indications from lower layers. & Upon receiving N311 consecutive in-sync indications from lower layers for the SpCell, upon receiving RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync for that cell group, upon reception of MobilityFromNRCommand, upon the reconfiguration of \( n f \) TimersAnd Constant, upon initiating the connection reestablishment procedure, upon conditional reconfiguration execution i.e. when applying a stored RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync for that cell group, and upon initiating the MCG failure information procedure. Upon SCG release, if the T310 is kept in SCG. & If the T310 is kept in MCG: If AS security is not activated: go to RRC_IDLE else: initiate the MCG failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.3b or the connection reestablishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7 or the procedure as specified in 5.3.10.3 if any DAPS bearer is configured. If the T310 is kept in SCG, Inform E-UTRAN/NR about the SCG radio link failure by initiating the SCG failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.3. \\
\hline T311 & Upon initiating the RRC connection reestablishment procedure & Upon selection of a suitable NR cell, or upon selection of a suitable L2 U2N Relay UE, or a cell using another RAT. & Enter RRC_IDLE \\
