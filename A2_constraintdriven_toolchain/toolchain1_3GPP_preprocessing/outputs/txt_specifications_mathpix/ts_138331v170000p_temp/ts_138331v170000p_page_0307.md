5.8.10.2.6 Sidelink reporting configuration removal

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \)-ReportConfigId included in the received \( s l \)-ReportConfigToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching \( s \) l-ReportConfigld from the \( s \) l-ReportConfigList within the VarMeasConfigSL;
\( 2> \) remove all \( s \)-MeasId associated with the \( s l \)-ReportConfigId from the \( s l \)-MeasIdList within the VarMeasConfigSL, if any;
\( 2> \) if a sl-Measld is removed from the sl-MeasldList:
\( 3> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this \( s l \)-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;
\( 3> \) stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this slMeasld.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the \( s l \)-ReportConfigToRemoveList includes any slReportConfigId value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.8.10.2.7 Sidelink reporting configuration addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each sl-ReportConfigId included in the received sl-ReportConfigToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if an entry with the matching \( s \)-ReportConfigId exists in the \( s \)-ReportConfigList within the VarMeasConfigSL, for this entry:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the entry with the value received for this \( s \)-ReportConfig;
\( 3> \) for each \( s \) /-MeasId associated with this \( s \) /-ReportConfigId included in the \( s \) /-MeasldList within the VarMeasConfigSL, if any:

4> remove the measurement reporting entry for this sl-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;

4> stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this sl-Measld;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for the received \( s \) l-ReportConfig to the \( s \) l-ReportConfigList within the VarMeasConfigSL.
5.8.10.2.8 Sidelink quantity configuration

The UE shall:
1> for each received sl-QuantityConfig:
\( 2> \) set the corresponding parameter(s) in sl-QuantityConfig within VarMeasConfigSL to the value of the received sl-QuantityConfig parameter(s);
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-MeasId included in the sl-MeasIdList within VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this \( s \)-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this slMeasId.
