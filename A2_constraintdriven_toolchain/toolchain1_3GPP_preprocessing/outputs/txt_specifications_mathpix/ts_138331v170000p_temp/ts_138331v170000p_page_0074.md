\( 2> \) reset the source MAC and release the source MAC configuration;
\( 2> \) for each DAPS bearer:
3> release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the source SpCell;

3> reconfigure the PDCP entity to release DAPS as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) for each SRB:
3> release the PDCP entity for the source SpCell;
\( 3> \) release the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the source SpCell;
\( 2> \) release the physical channel configuration for the source SpCell;
\( 2> \) discard the keys used in the source SpCell (the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { int }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the Kupene key), if any;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration is received via other RAT (i.e., inter-RAT handover to NR):
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration does not include the fullConfig and the UE is connected to 5GC (i.e., delta signalling during intra 5GC handover):
\( 3> \) re-use the source RAT SDAP and PDCP configurations if available (i.e., current SDAP/PDCP configurations for all RBs from source E-UTRARAT prior to the reception of the inter-RAT HO RRCReconfiguration message);

1> else:
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the fullConfig:
\( 3> \) perform the full configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.5.11;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the masterCellGroup:
\( 2> \) perform the cell group configuration for the received masterCellGroup according to 5.3.5.5;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the masterKeyUpdate:
\( 2> \) perform AS security key update procedure as specified in 5.3.5.7;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the \( s k \)-Counter:
\( 2> \) perform security key update procedure as specified in 5.3.5.7;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the secondaryCellGroup:
\( 2> \) perform the cell group configuration for the SCG according to 5.3.5.5;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig:
\( 2> \) if the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig is set to setup:
\( 3> \) if the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig includes mrdc-ReleaseAndAdd:
4> perform MR-DC release as specified in clause 5.3.5.10;
\( 3> \) if the received mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup is set to \( n r-S C G \) :
\( 4> \) perform the RRC reconfiguration according to 5.3.5.3 for the RRCReconfiguration message included in \( n r-S C G \);

3> if the received mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup is set to eutra-SCG:
