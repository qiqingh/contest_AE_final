3> if the associated T304 was not initiated upon cell selection performed while timer T311 was running, as defined in clause 5.3.7.3:

4> store the handover failure information in VarRLF-Report as described in the clause 5.3.10.5;
3> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in clause 5.3.7.
NOTE 1: In the context above, "the UE configuration" includes state variables and parameters of each radio bearer.
1> else if T304 of a secondary cell group expires:
\( 2> \) if MCG transmission is not suspended:
\( 3> \) release dedicated preambles provided in rach-ConfigDedicated, if configured;
3> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in clause 5.7.3 to report SCG reconfiguration with sync failure, upon which the RRC reconfiguration procedure ends;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if the UE is in NR-DC:
\( 4> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in clause 5.3.7;
\( 3> \) else (the UE is in (NG) EN-DC):
4> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.7;
1> else if T304 expires when RRCReconfiguration is received via other RAT (HO to NR failure):
\( 2> \) reset MAC;
\( 2> \) perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the specifications applicable for the other RAT.
NOTE 2: In this clause, the term 'handover failure' has been used to refer to 'reconfiguration with sync failure'.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the delayBudgetReportingConfig:
\( 2> \) if delayBudgetReportingConfig is set to setup:
\( 3> \) consider itself to be configured to send delay budget reports in accordance with 5.7.4;
\( 2> \) else:
3> consider itself not to be configured to send delay budget reports and stop timer T342, if running.
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the overheatingAssistanceConfig:
\( 2> \) if overheatingAssistanceConfig is set to setup:
\( 3> \) consider itself to be configured to provide overheating assistance information in accordance with 5.7.4;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) consider itself not to be configured to provide overheating assistance information and stop timer T345, if running;

1> if the received otherConfig includes the idc-AssistanceConfig:
2 if idc-AssistanceConfig is set to setup:
\( 3> \) consider itself to be configured to provide IDC assistance information in accordance with 5.7.4;
\( 2> \) else:
