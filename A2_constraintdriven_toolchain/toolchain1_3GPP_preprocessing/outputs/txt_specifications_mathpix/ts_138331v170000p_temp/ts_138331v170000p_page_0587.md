\hline MeasConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16 \\
If the field is set to true, UE is configured to perform SSB based inter-frequency measurement without measurement gaps when the inter-frequency SSB is completely contained in the active DL BWP of the UE, as specified in TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.3. Otherwise, the SSB based inter-frequency measurement is performed within measurement gaps. In NR-DC, the field can only be configured in the measConfig associated with MCG, and when configured, it applies to all the inter-frequency measurements configured by MN and SN .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measGapConfig \\
Used to setup and release measurement gaps in NR.

List of measurement identities to add and/or modify.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
s-MeasureConfig \\
Threshold for NR SpCell RSRP measurement controlling when the UE is required to perform measurements on non-serving cells. Choice of ssb-RSRP corresponds to cell RSRP based on SS/PBCH block and choice of csi-RSRP corresponds to cell RSRP of CSI-RS.

measGapSharingConfig \\
Specifies the measurement gap sharing scheme and controls setup/ release of measurement gap sharing.
