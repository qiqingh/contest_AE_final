5.8.10.2.3 Sidelink measurement identity addition/modification

The UE shall:
1> for each sl-Measld included in the received s/-Meas/dToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if an entry with the matching \( s \)-MeasId exists in the \( s \) /-MeasIdList within the VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 3> \) replace the entry with the value received for this \( s l \)-Measld;
\( 2> \) else:
3> add a new entry for this sl-Measld within the VarMeasConfigSL;
\( 2> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this \( s l \)-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this slMeasld;
5.8.10.2.4 Sidelink measurement object removal

The UE shall:
1> for each sl-MeasObject[d included in the received sl-MeasObjectToRemoveList that is part of sl-MeasObjectList in VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching \( s \) /-MeasObjectld from the \( s \) /-MeasObjectList within the VarMeasConfigSL;
\( 2> \) remove all \( s \) /-MeasId associated with this sl-MeasObjectld from the sl-MeasldList within the VarMeasConfigSL, if any;
\( 2> \) if a sl-Measld is removed from the sl-MeasldList:
\( 3> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this \( s \)-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;
\( 3> \) stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this slMeasId.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the \( s / \)-MeasObjectToRemoveList includes any \( s / \) MeasObjectld value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.8.10.2.5 Sidelink measurement object addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-MeasObjectld included in the received \( s \) /-MeasObjectToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if an entry with the matching \( s \)-MeasObjectld exists in the \( s \)-MeasObjectList within the VarMeasConfigSL, for this entry:

3> for each sl-Measld associated with this sl-MeasObjectld included in the sl-MeasIdList within the VarMeasConfigSL, if any:
\( 4> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this sl-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;

4> stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this sl-Measld;
\( 3> \) reconfigure the entry with the value received for this sl-MeasObject;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for the received \( s \) l-MeasObject to the \( s \) l-MeasObjectList within VarMeasConfigSL.
