\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline AppLayerMeasConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measConfigAppLayerContainer \\
The field contains configuration of application layer measurements, see Annex L (normative) in TS 26.247 [68], clause 16.5 in TS 26.114 [69] and TS 26.118 [70].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfBufferLevelEntries \\
The field contains the maximum number of buffer level entries that can be reported for RAN visible application layer measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pauseReporting \\
The field indicates whether the transmission of measReportAppLayerContainer is paused or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ran-VisiblePeriodicity \\
The field indicates the periodicity of RAN visible reporting. Value ms 120 indicates 120 ms , value ms 240 indicates 240 ms and so on. If no value is indicated and the UE is configured with RAN visible reporting, the same periodicity as indicated in the measConfigAppLayerContainer is used.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportinitialPlayoutDelay \\
The field indicates whether the UE shall report Initial Playout Delay for RAN visible application layer measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rrc-SegAllowed \\
This field, when received in MeasConfigAappLayerMeasConfigList, indicates that RRC segmentation of MeasurementReportAppLayer is allowed. It may be present only if the UE supports RRC message segmentation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
serviceType \\
Indicates the type of application layer measurement. Value streaming indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for streaming services (see TS 26.247 [68]), value mtsi indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for MTSI (see TS 26.114 [69]). value vr indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for VR service (see TS 26.118 [70]). The network always configures service Type when application layer measurements are initially configured and at fullConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
transmissionOfSessionStartStop \\
The field indicates whether the UE shall transmit indications when sessions in the application layer start and stop. The UE transmits a session start indication upon configuration of this field if a session already has started in the application layer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- AreaConfiguration

The AreaConfiguration indicates area for which UE is requested to perform measurement logging. If not configured, measurement logging is not restricted to specific cells or tracking areas but applies as long as the RPLMN is contained in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport.
