\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SDT-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-DRB-ContinueROHC \\
Indicates whether the PDCP entity for the radio bearers configured for SDT continues or resets the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment during SDT procedure, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value cell indicates that ROHC header compression continues when the UE resumes for SDT in the same cell as the PCell when the RRCRelease message is received. Value ma indicates that ROHC header compression continues when the UE resumes for SDT in a cell belonging to the same RNA as the PCell when the RRCRelease message is received. If the field is absent PDCP entity for the radio bearers configured for SDT reset the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment during SDT procedure, as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-DRB-List \\
Indicates the ID(s) of the DRB(s) that are configured for SDT. If size of the sequence is zero, then the UE assumes that none of the DRBs are configured for SDT. The network only configures MN terminated MCG bearers for SDT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-SRB2-indication \\
Indiates whether SRB2 is configured for SDT or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SDT-MAC-PHY-CG-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB \\
An RSRP threshold configured for SSB selection for CG-SDT as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
CG-SDT-TA-ValiditationConfig \\
Configuration for the RSRP based TA validation. If this IE is not configured, then the UE does not perform RSRP based TA validation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-SDT-timeAlignmentTimer \\
TAT value for CG-SDT as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The network always configures this when solt-MAC-PHY-CG-Config is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CG-SDT-TA-ValiditationConfig field descriptions \\
\hline cg-SDT-RSRP-ChangeThreshold \\
The RSRP threshold for TA validation for CG-SDT as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SRS-PosRRC-inactiveConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bwp \\
BWP configuration for SRS for Positioning during the RRC_INACTIVE state. If the field is absent UE is configured with an SRS for Positioning associated with the initial UL BWP and transmitted, during the RRC INACTIVE state, inside the initial UL BWP with the same CP and SCS as configured for initial UL BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
inactivePosSRS-AbsThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation \\
absolute RSRP threshold for determining the set of SSBs for derivation of downlink pathloss reference for TA validation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
inactivePosSRS-NrofSS-Blocks ToAverage \\
number of SSBs with highest RSRPs for derivation of downlink pathloss reference for TA validation
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
inactivePosSRS-RSRP-changeThresh \\
RSRP threshold for the increase/decrease of RSRP for time alignment validation
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srs-TimeAlignmnetTimer \\
TA timer for SRS for positioning transmission during RRC_INACTIVE State. \\
Editor's Note: Range to be taken from SDT
