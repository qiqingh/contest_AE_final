- Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field \( D \) can only be signalled if field \( C \) is configured and set to value \( Y \). (i.e. regardless of whether field \( C \) is present in the same message or previously configured).

The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.
```
-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE [
    fieldA FieldA OPTIONAL, -- Need M
    fieldB FieldB OPTONAL, -- Cond FieldAsetToX
    fieldC FieldC OPTIONAL, -- Need M
    fieldD FieldD OPTIONAL, -- Cond FieldCsetToY
    nonCriticalExtension
}
-- /example/ ASN1STOP
```


\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Conditional presence } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Explanation } \\
\hline Field AsetToX & \begin{tabular}{l} 
The field is mandatory present if fieldA is included and set to valueX. Otherwise the field \\
is optionally present, need R.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Field \( C \) setToY & \begin{tabular}{l} 
The field is optionally present, need M, if fieldC is configured and set to valueY. Otherwise \\
the field is absent and the UE does not maintain the value
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
A. 8 Miscellaneous

The following miscellaneous convention should be used:
- UE capabilities: TS 38.306 [26] specifies that the network should in general respect the UE's capabilities. Hence there is no need to include statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.
