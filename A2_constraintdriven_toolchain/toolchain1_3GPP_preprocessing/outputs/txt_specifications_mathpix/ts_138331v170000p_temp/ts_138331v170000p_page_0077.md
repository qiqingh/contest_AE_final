\( 2> \) for each periodic musim-GapID included in the received musim-GapToAddModList:
3> if an entry with the matching musim-GapID exists in the musim-GapConfigList:
\( 4> \) replace the entry with the value received for this musim-GapID;
\( 3> \) else:
4> add a new entry for this musim-GapID;
1> if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the appLayerMeasConfig:
\( 2> \) perform the application layer measurement configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.5.13d;
\( 1> \) set the content of the RRCReconfigurationComplete message as follows:
◇ if the RRCReconfiguration includes the masterCellGroup containing the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrent:
3> include the uplinkTxDirectCurrentList for each MCG serving cell with UL;
3> include uplinkDirectCurrentBWP-SUL for each MCG serving cell configured with SUL carrier, if any, within the uplinkTxDirectCurrentList;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the masterCellGroup containing the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier:

3> include in the uplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierList the list of uplink Tx DC locations for the configured intra-band uplink carrier aggregation in the MCG;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the secondaryCellGroup containing the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrent:
3> include the uplinkTxDirectCurrentList for each SCG serving cell with UL;
3> include uplinkDirectCurrentBWP-SUL for each SCG serving cell configured with SUL carrier, if any, within the uplinkTxDirectCurrentList;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the secondaryCellGroup containing the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier:

3> include in the uplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierList the list of uplink Tx DC locations for the configured intra-band uplink carrier aggregation in the SCG;

NOTE 0b:It is expected that the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier is only received either in masterCellGroup or in secondaryCellGroup but not both.
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig with mrdcSecondaryCellGroup set to eutra-SCG:

3> include in the eutra-SCG-Response the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.3.5.3;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig with mrdcSecondaryCellGroup set to nr-SCG:

3> include in the nr-SCG-Response the SCG RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message is applied due to conditional reconfiguration execution:
\( 4> \) include in the selectedCondRRCReconfig the condReconfigld for the selected cell of conditional reconfiguration execution;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the reconfigurationWithSync in spCellConfig of an MCG:
3> if the UE has logged measurements available for NR and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport:

4> if the sigLoggedMeasType in VarLogMeasReport is included:
