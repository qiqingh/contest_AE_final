\hline UEAssistancelnformation field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
affectedCarrierFreqList \\
Indicates a list of NR carrier frequencies that are affected by IDC problem.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
affectedCarrierFreqCombList \\
Indicates a list of NR carrier frequencie combinations that are affected by IDC problems due to Inter-Modulation Distortion and harmonics from NR when configured with UL CA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bfd-MeasRelaxationState \\
Indicates the relaxation state of BFD measurements. Each bit corresponds to a serving cell of the cell group. A serving cell is mapped to the (servCellindex+1)-th bit, starting from MSB. A bit that is set to 1 indicates that the UE performs BFD measurements relaxation on the serving cell mapped on the bit. A bit that is set to 0 indicates that the UE does not perform BFD measurements relaxation on the serving cell mapped on the bit.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
delayBudgetReport \\
Indicates the UE-preferred adjustment to connected mode DRX.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
interferenceDirection \\
Indicates the direction of IDC interference. Value \( n r \) indicates that only NR is victim of IDC interference, value other indicates that only another radio is victim of IDC interference and value both indicates that both NR and another radio are victims of IDC interference. The other radio refers to either the ISM radio or GNSS (see TR 36.816 [44]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
minSchedulingOffsetPreference \\
Indicates the UE's preferences on minimumScheduling Offset of cross-slot scheduling for power saving.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
minScheduling OffsetPreferenceExt \\
Indicates the UE's preferences on minimumSchedulingOffset of cross-slot scheduling for power saving for SCS 480 kHz and/or 960 kHz .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapLength \\
Indicates the length of the UE's preferred MUSIM gap length.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapOffset \\
Indicates the gap offset of the UE's preferred MUSIM gap.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapPreferenceList \\
Indicates the MUSIM gap(s) that the UE prefers to be configured with.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim- PreferredRRC-State \\
Indicates the UE's preferred RRC state when leaving RRC_CONNECTED.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapRepetitionAndOffsetPeriod \\
Indicates the gap repetition period and gap offset of the UE's preferred periodic MUSIM gap without leaving RRC_CONNECTED state. This field is only used for periodic gaps.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-PrefStarting-SFN-AndSubframex \\
Indicates gap starting position offor UE's preferred aperiodic MUSIM gap without leaving RRC_CONNECTED state
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preferredDRX-InactivityTimer \\
Indicates the UE's preferred DRX inactivity timer length for power saving. Value in ms (milliSecond). \( m s 0 \) corresponds to \( 0, m s 1 \) corresponds to \( 1 \mathrm{~ms}, m s 2 \) corresponds to 2 ms , and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the DRX inactivity timer. If secondary DRX group is configured, the preferredDRX-InactivityTimer only applies to the default DRX group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preferredDRX-LongCycle \\
Indicates the UE's preferred long DRX cycle length for power saving. Value in \( \mathrm{ms} . \mathrm{ms} 10 \) corresponds to \( 10 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~ms} 20 \) corresponds to \( 20 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~ms} 32 \) corresponds to 32 ms , and so on. If preferredDRX-ShortCycle is provided, the value of preferredDRX-LongCycle shall be a multiple of the preferredDRX-ShortCycle value. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the long DRX cycle.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preferredDRX-ShortCycle \\
Indicates the UE's preferred short DRX cycle length for power saving. Value in ms. ms2 corresponds to \( 2 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~ms} 3 \) corresponds to \( 3 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~ms} 4 \) corresponds to 4 ms , and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the short DRX cycle.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preferredDRX-ShortCycleTimer \\
Indicates the UE's preferred short DRX cycle timer for power saving. Value in multiples of preferredDRX-ShortCycle. A value of 1 corresponds to preferredDRX-ShortCycle, a value of 2 corresponds to 2 * preferredDRX-ShortCycle and so on. If the field is absent from the DRX-Preference IE, it is interpreted as the UE having no preference for the short DRX cycle timer. A preference for the short DRX cycle is indicated when a preference for the short DRX cycle timer is indicated.
