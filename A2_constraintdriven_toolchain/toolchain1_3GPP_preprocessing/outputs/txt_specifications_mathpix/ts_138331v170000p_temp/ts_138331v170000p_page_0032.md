In the ASN.1, lower case may be used for some (parts) of the above abbreviations e.g. c-RNTI.
4 General
4.1 Introduction

This specification is organised as follows:
- clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
- clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as the services expected from lower layers;
- clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
- clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
- clause 6 specifies the RRC messages in ASN. 1 and description;
- clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants) and counters to be used by the UE;
- clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
- clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
- clause 10 specifies generic error handling;
- clause 11 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
- clause 12 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance requirements.
4.2 Architecture
4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT

A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
- RRC_IDLE:
- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
- An MBS broadcast specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
- The UE:
- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI;
- If configured by upper layers for MBS multicast reception, monitors Paging channel for CN paging using TMGI;
