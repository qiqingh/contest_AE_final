sl-ThresholdRSRP-Condition1-B-1-Option2List
Indicates the RSRP threshold used to determine reserved resource(s) of other UE(s) whose RSRP measurement is smaller than it as the set of resource(s) non-preferred for UE-B's transmission for Condition 1-B-1 of Scheme 1, as specified in TS 38.214 [19]. Value 0 corresponds to minus infinity dBm, value 1 corresponds to -128 dBm , value 2 corresponds to -126 dBm , value n corresponds to \( \left(-128+(\mathrm{n}-1)^{\star} 2\right) \mathrm{dBm} \) and so on, value 66 corresponds to infinity dBm .

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-InterUE-CoordinationScheme2 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-indicationUE-B \\
Indicates whether to enable or disable the usage of 1 LSB of reserved bits of a SCI format 1-A to indicate of whether UE scheduling a conflict TB can be UE-B or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-IUC-Scheme2 \\
Indicates whether inter-UE coordination scheme 2 is enabled or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-OptionForCondition 2-A-1 \\
Indicates the RSRP threshold used to consider additional criteria for condition 2-A-1. Value 0 corresponds to the RSRP threshold according to the priorities included in the SCI. Value 1 corresponds to a (pre)configured RSRP threshold compared to the RSRP measurement of UE-B' or another UE's reserved resource.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PSFCH-Occasion \\
Indicates the reference slot from which a PSFCH occasion for inter-UE coordination information transmission is derived. Value 0 corresponds to the slot where UE-B's SCI is transmitted and value 1 corresponds to the slot where expected/potential resource conflict occurs on PSSCH resource indicated by UE-B's SCI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-RB-SetPSFCH \\
Indicates the set of PRBs that are actually used for inter-UE coordination information transmission and reception in Scheme 2. The leftmost bit of the bitmap refers to the lowest RB index in the resource pool, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-SiotLevelResourceExclusion \\
Indicates that physical layer of UE-B reports resources in a slot including the next reserved resource indicated by the corresponding UE-B's SCI for current TB transmission to higher layer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TypeUE-A \\
Indicates that a non-destination UE of a TB transmitted by UE-B can be UE-A which sends inter-UE coordination information to UE-B, when UE-A is a destination UE of another TB conflicting with the TB transmitted by UE-B.
