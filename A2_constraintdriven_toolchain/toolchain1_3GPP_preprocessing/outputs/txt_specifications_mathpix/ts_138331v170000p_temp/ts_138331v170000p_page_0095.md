\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithm and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key configured/derived as specified in TS 36.331 [10];

4> else (i.e., a UE capable of NGEN-DC):
\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) ) associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} \) ) or secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse, if applicable;
\( 3> \) else (i.e., UE connected to NR or UE connected to E-UTRA/EPC):
\( 4> \) configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {eNB }} / \mathrm{K}_{\text {gNB }} \) ) or the secondary key (S \( -\mathrm{K}_{\text {gNB }} / \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\text {eNB }} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse;
\( 2> \) if the PDCP entity of this DRB is configured with integrityProtection:
\( 3> \) configure the PDCP entity with the integrity protection algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPInt }} \) key associated with the master ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{cNB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) or the secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse;
\( 2> \) if an sdap-Config is included:
\( 3> \) if an SDAP entity with the received pdu-Session does not exist:
\( 4> \) establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1;
4- if an SDAP entity with the received pdu-Session did not exist prior to receiving this reconfiguration:
\( 5> \) indicate the establishment of the user plane resources for the pdu-Session to upper layers;
\( 3> \) configure the SDAP entity in accordance with the received sdap-Config as specified in TS 37.324 [24] and associate the DRB with the SDAP entity;
\( 3> \) for each QFI value added in mappedQoS-FlowsToAdd, if the QFI value is previously configured, the QFI value is released from the old DRB;
\( 2> \) if the DRB is associated with an eps-BearerIdentity:
\( 3> \) if the DRB was configured with the same eps-BearerIdentity either by NR or E-UTRA prior to receiving this reconfiguration:
\( 4> \) associate the established DRB with the corresponding eps-BearerIdentity;
\( 3> \) else:
4 indicate the establishment of the \( \mathrm{DRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) and the eps-BearerIdentity of the established \( \mathrm{DRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) to upper layers;
\( 1> \) for each \( d r b \)-Identity value included in the \( d r b \)-ToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration and configured as DAPS bearer:
\( 2> \) reconfigure the PDCP entity to configure DAPS with the ciphering function, integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target cell group as specified in TS 38.323 [5] and configure it in accordance with the received pdcp-Config;
\( 2> \) if the masterKeyUpdate is received:
\( 3> \) if the ciphering function of the target cell group PDCP entity is not configured with cipheringDisabled:
\( 4> \) configure the ciphering function of the target cell group PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithm according to securityConfig and apply the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ), as indicated in keyToUse, i.e the ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent PDCP PDUs received from the target cell group and sent to the target cell group by the UE;
\( 3> \) if the integrity protection function of the target cell group PDCP entity is configured with
integrityProtection:
