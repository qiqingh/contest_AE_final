\hline SecurityAlgorithmConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cipheringAlgorithm \\
Indicates the ciphering algorithm to be used for SRBs and DRBs, as specified in TS 33.501 [11]. The algorithms nea0-nea3 are identical to the LTE algorithms eea0-3. The algorithms configured for all bearers using master key shall be the same, and the algorithms configured for all bearers using secondary key, if any, shall be the same. If UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC, this field indicates the ciphering algorithm to be used for RBs configured with NR PDCP, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
integrityProtAlgorithm \\
Indicates the integrity protection algorithm to be used for SRBs and DRBs, as specified in TS 33.501 [11]. The algorithms niaO-nia3 are identical to the E-UTRA algorithms eia \( 0-3 \). The algorithms configured for all bearers using master key shall be the same and the algorithms configured for all bearers using secondary key, if any, shall be the same. The network does not configure nia \( O \) except for unauthenticated emergency sessions for unauthenticated UEs in LSM (limited service mode). \\
If UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC, this field indicates the integrity protection algorithm to be used for SRBs configured with NR PDCP as specified in TS 33.501 [11], and DRBs configured with integrity protection as specified in TS 33.401 [30]. The network does not configure nia 0 for SRB3.

- SemiStaticChannelAccessConfig

The IE SemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is used to configure channel access parameters when the network is operating in semi-static channel access mode (see clause 4.3 TS 37.213 [48].
