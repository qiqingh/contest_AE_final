\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasGapConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapAssociationPRS \\
Indicates that PRS measurement is associated with this measurement gap. The network only includes this field for one per UE gap.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR1 \\
Indicates measurement gap configuration that applies to FR1 only. In (NG)EN-DC, gapFR1 cannot be set up by NR RRC (i.e. only LTE RRC can configure FR1 measurement gap). In NE-DC, gapFR1 can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure FR1 gap). In NR-DC, gapFR1 can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. gapFR1 can not be configured together with gapUE unless concurrent MGs are supported. The applicability of the FR1 measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR1ToAddModList \\
A list of of FR1 measurement gap configuartion to be added or modified. In this version of the specification, the network configures this field only in NR standalone.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR1ToReleaseList \\
A list of FR1 measurement gap configuartion to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR2 \\
Indicates measurement gap configuration applies to FR2 only. In (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC, gapFR2 can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure FR2 gap). In NR-DC, gapFR2 can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. gapFR2 cannot be configured together with gapUE unless concurrent MGs are supported. The applicability of the FR2 measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR2ToAddModList \\
A list of FR2 measurement gap configuration to be added or modified. In this version of the specification, the network configures this field only in NR standalone.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapFR2ToReleaseList \\
A list of FR2 measurement gap configuration to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapPriority \\
Indicates the priority of this measurement gap (see TS 38.133 [14], clause FFS). Value 1 indicates highest priority, value 2 indicates second level priority, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapSharing \\
Indicates the measurement gap sharing scheme that applies to this GapConfig. For applicability of the different gap sharing schemes, see TS 38.133 [14]. Value scheme 00 corresponds to scheme " 00 ", value scheme01 corresponds to scheme " 01 ", and so on. The network does not include this field if this GapConfig is configured by gapFR1, gapFR2, or gapUE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapUE \\
Indicates measurement gap configuration that applies to all frequencies (FR1 and FR2). In (NG)EN-DC, gapUE cannot be set up by NR RRC (i.e. only LTE RRC can configure per UE measurement gap). In NE-DC, gapUE can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure per UE gap). In NR-DC, gapUE can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. The per UE measurement gap is configured with other FR1 gap and/or FR2 gap simultaneously only while this per UE gap is associated with PRS measurement. The applicability of the per UE measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapUEToAddModList \\
A list of per UE measurement gap configuartion to be added or modified. A per UE measurement gap can be configured with other FR1 gap and/or FR2 gap simultaneously only while this per UE gap is associated with PRS measurement. In this version of the specification, the network configures this field only in NR standalone.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapUEToReleaseList \\
A list of per UE measurement gap configuartion to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapOffset \\
Value gapOffset is the gap offset of the gap pattern with MGRP indicated in the field mgrp. The value range is from 0 to \( m g r p-1 \). If \( n s c g / n d-r 17 \) is present, this offset value refers to the starting point of VIL1 (the visible interruption length before the ML).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measGapid \\
The ID of this measurement gap configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mgl \\
Value \( m g / \) is the measurement gap length in \( m s \) of the measurement gap. If nscglnd-r 17 is not present, the measurement gap length is according to in Table 9.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. If nscg/nd-r 17 is present, this field indicates the measurement length (ML) in NCSG pattern and is configured according to Table 9.1.2C-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. Value \( m s 1 d o t 5 \) corresponds to \( 1.5 \mathrm{~ms}, m s 3 \) corresponds to 3 ms and so on. If \( m g l-r 16 \) or \( m g l-r 17 \) is present, UE shall ignore the \( m g l \) (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mgrp \\
Value \( m g r p \) is measurement gap repetition period in (ms) of the measurement gap. The measurement gap repetition period is according to Table 9.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14].
