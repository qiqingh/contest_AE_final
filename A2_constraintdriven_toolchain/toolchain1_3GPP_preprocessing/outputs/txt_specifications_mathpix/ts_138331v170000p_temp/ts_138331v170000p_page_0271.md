ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

exchanged by PC5-S messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], and apply to the corresponding PC5RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-DRBs of the corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or ciphered by the PDCP.

For unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57], UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.

NOTE 1: In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in clause 5.8 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], respectively.

NOTE 2: In this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].

NOTE 3: All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as in TS 33.536 [60].

NOTE 4: When integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].
5.8.2 Conditions for NR sidelink communication operation

The UE shall perform NR sidelink communication operation only if the conditions defined in this clause are met:
1> if the UE's serving cell is suitable (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED); and if either the selected cell on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation belongs to the registered or equivalent PLMN as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or

1> if the UE's serving cell (RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) fulfils the conditions to support NR sidelink communication in limited service state as specified in TS 23.287 [55]; and if either the serving cell is on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
\( 1> \) if the UE has no serving cell (RRC_IDLE);
5.8.3 Sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication
5.8.3.1 General

Figure 5.8.3.1-1: Sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication

The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE:
- is interested or no longer interested to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication,
- is requesting assignment or release of transmission resource for NR sidelink communication,
- is reporting QoS parameters and QoS profile(s) related to NR sidelink communication,
