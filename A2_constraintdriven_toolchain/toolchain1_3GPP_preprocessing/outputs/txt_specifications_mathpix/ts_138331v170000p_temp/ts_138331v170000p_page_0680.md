\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrdc-PCmode-FR2 \\
Indicates the uplink power sharing mode that the UE uses in NR-DC in frequency range 2 (FR2) (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.6).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-BlindDetection, pdcch-BlindDetection2, pdcch-BlindDetection3 \\
Indicates the reference number of cells for PDCCH blind detection for the CG. Network configures the field for each CG when the UE is in NR DC and sets the value in accordance with the constraints specified in TS 38.213 [13]. The network configures pdcch-BlindDetection only if the UE is in NR-DC. The network configures pdcch- \\
BlindDetection2 only if the UE is in NR-DC with at least one downlink cell using Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability. The network configures pdcch-BlindDetection3 only if the UE is in NR-DC with at least one downlink cell using Rel-15 PDCCH monitoring capability.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-BlindDetectionCA-Combindicator \\
Configure one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 (for R15) and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 (for R16) for UE to use for scaling PDCCH monitoring capability if the number of serving cells configured to a UE is larger than the reported capability, and if UE reports more than one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch- \\
BlindDetectionCA2 as UE capability. The combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2) configured by pdcch-BlindDetectionCACombIndicator is from the more than one combination of pdcch-BlindDetectionCA1 and pdcch-BlindDetectionCA2 reported by UE (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-NR-FR1 \\
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in this NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1). The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by \( p \)-Max (configured in Frequency/nfoUL) and by \( p \)-UE-FR1 (configured total for all serving cells operating on FR1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-NR-FR2 \\
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in this NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2). The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by \( p \)-Max (configured in Frequency/nfoUL) and by \( p \)-UE-FR2 (configured total for all serving cells operating on FR2). This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
prioLowDG-HighCG \\
Enable PHY prioritization for the case where low-priority dynamic grant-PUSCH collides with high-priority configured grant-PUSCH on a BWP of a serving cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9), when the UE has generated transport blocks for both DG-PUSCH and CG-PUSCH as described in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
prioHighDG-LowCG \\
Enable PHY prioritization for the case where high-priority dynamic grant PUSCH collides with low-priority configured grant PUSCH on a BWP of a serving cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9), when the UE has generated transport blocks for both DG-PUSCH and CG-PUSCH as described in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-RNTI \\
RNTI value for scrambling CRC of DCI format 2-6 used for power saving (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-Offset \\
The start of the search-time of DCI format 2-6 with CRC scrambled by PS-RNTI relative to the start of the drx-onDurationTimer of Long DRX (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.3). Value in multiples of 0.125 ms (milliseconds). 1 corresponds to \( 0.125 \mathrm{~ms}, 2 \) corresponds to \( 0.25 \mathrm{~ms}, 3 \) corresponds to 0.375 ms and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-WakeUp \\
Indicates the UE to wake-up if DCI format 2-6 is not detected outside active time (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not wake-up if DCI format 26 is not detected outside active time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-PositionDCI-2-6 \\
Starting position of UE wakeup and SCell dormancy indication in DCI format 2-6 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP \\
Indicates the UE to transmit periodic L1-RSRP report(s) when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not transmit periodic L1-RSRP report(s) when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI \\
Indicates the UE to transmit periodic CSI report(s) other than L1-RSRP reports when the drx-onDurationTimer does not start (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.7). If the field is absent, the UE does not transmit periodic CSI report(s) other than L1-RSRP reports when the drx-onDuration Timer does not start.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-UE-FR1 \\
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1) across all cell groups. The maximum transmit power that the UE may use may be additionally limited by p-Max (configured in Frequency/nfoUL) and by p-NR-FR1 (configured for the cell group).
