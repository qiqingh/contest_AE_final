\( 2> \) the session of this service is ongoing or about to start; and
\( 2> \) one or more MBS FSAIs in the USD for this service is included in SIB21 acquired from the PCell for a frequency belonging to the set of MBS frequencies of interest, determined according to 5.9.4.3.

NOTE: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 38.300 [2] or TS 23.247 [67].
5.9.4.5 Setting of the contents of MBS Interest Indication

The UE shall set the contents of the MBS Interest Indication as follows:
\( 1> \) if the set of MBS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.9.4.3, is not empty:
\( 2> \) include \( m b s \)-FreqList and set it to include the MBS frequencies of interest sorted by decreasing order of interest, using the absoluteFrequencySSB for serving frequency, if applicable, and the ARFCN-ValueNR(s) as included in SIB21 (for neighbouring frequencies);
\( 2> \) include \( m b s \)-Priority if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated MBS frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers and multicast MRBs;

NOTE: If the UE prioritises MBS reception and unicast data cannot be supported because of congestion on the MBS carrier(s), NG-RAN may for example initiate release of unicast bearers.
\( 2> \) if SIB20 is scheduled by the PCell:
3> include mbs-ServiceList and set it to indicate the set of MBS services of interest sorted by decreasing order of interest determined in accordance with 5.9.4.4.
