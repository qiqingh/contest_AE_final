\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-InterUE-CoordinationScheme1 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-Condition 1-A-2 \\
Indicates disabling the use of condition of excluding from preferred resource set resource(s) in slot(s) where UE-A, when it is intended receiver of UE-B, does not expect to perform SL reception from UE-B due to half duplex operation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-ContainerCoordinfo \\
Indicates whether a SCI format 2-C can be used as the container of inter-UE coordination information transmission from UE-A to UE-B in Scheme 1 in addition to using MAC CE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-ContainerRequest \\
Indicates whether a SCI format 2-C can be used as the container of an explicit request for inter-UE coordination information transmission form UE-B to UE-A in Scheme 1 in addition to using MAC CE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-DetermineResourceType \\
Indicates how to determine the resource set type to be provided by inter-UE coordination information transmission. Value "uea" means the resource set type is determined by UE-A's implementation. Value "ueb" means the resource set type is determined by UE-B's request.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-IUC-Condition \\
Indicates whether inter-UE coordination information triggered by a condition is enabled or not other than explicit request reception.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-IUC-Explicit \\
Indicates whether inter-UE coordination information triggered by an explicit request is enabled or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-MaxSlotOffsetTRIV \\
Indicates the maximum value of logical slot offset with respect to a reference slot that is used for representing the first resource location of each TRIV to indicate the set of resources in Scheme 1 as specified in TS 38.214 [19].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-NumSubCH-PreferredResousrceSet \\
Indicates the number of sub-channels used for determining the preferred resource set in Scheme 1 when the inter-UE coordination information transmission is triggered by a condition other than explicit request reception.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PriorityCoordinfoCondition \\
Indicates the priority value of inter-UE coordination information triggered by a condition other than explicit request reception in Scheme 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PriorityCoordinfoExplicit \\
Indicates the priority value of inter-UE coordination information triggered by an explicit request in Scheme 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PriorityPreferredResourceSet \\
Indicates the priority value used for determining the preferred resource set in Scheme 1 when the inter-UE coordination information transmission is triggered by a condition other than explicit request reception.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PriorityRequest \\
Indicates the priority value of an explicit request for inter-UE coordination information in Scheme 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-ReservedPeriodPreferredResourceSet \\
Indicates the resource reservation interval used for determining the preferred resource set in Scheme 1 when the inter-UE coordination information transmission is triggered by a condition, by means of an index to the corresponding entry of si-ResourceReservePeriodList-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TriggerConditionCoordinfo \\
Indicates the trigger condition of inter-UE coordination information from UE-A to UE-B. Value 0 means inter-UE coordination information is triggered by UE-A's implementation. Value 1 means inter-UE coordination information is triggered only when UE-A has data to be transmitted together with the inter-UE coordination information to UE-B.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TriggerConditionRequest \\
Indicates the trigger condition of an explicit request from UE-B to UE-A. Value 0 means the explicit request is triggered by UE-B's implementation. Value 1 means the explicit request is triggered only when UE-B has data to be transmitted to UE-A.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-ThresholdRSRP-Condition 1-B-1-Option 1List \\
Indicates the RSRP threshold used to determine reserved resource(s) of other UE(s) whose RSRP measurement is larger than it as the set of resource(s) non-preferred for UEB's transmission for Condition 1-B-1 of Scheme 1, as specified in TS 38.214 [19]. Value 0 corresponds to minus infinity dBm, value 1 corresponds to -128 dBm , value 2 corresponds to -126 dBm , value n corresponds to \( \left(-128+(\mathrm{n}-1)^{* 2} 2\right) \mathrm{dBm} \) and so on, value 66 corresponds to infinity dBm .
