\hline SIB20 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcch-WindowDuration \\
Indicates, starting from the slot indicated by mcch-WindowStartSlot, the duration in slot during which MCCH may be scheduled. Absence of this field means that MCCH is only scheduled in the slot indicated by mcch-WindowStartSlot.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcch-ModificationPeriod \\
Defines periodically appearing boundaries, i.e. radio frames for which SFN mod mcch-ModificationPeriod \( =0 \). The contents of different transmissions of MCCH information can only be different if there is at least one such boundary in-between them. Value rf2 corresponds to two radio frames, value rf4 corresponds to four radio frames and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcch-RepetitionPeriodAndOffset \\
Defines the length and the offset of the MCCH repetition period. rf1 corresponds to a repetition period length of one radio frame, rf2 corresponds to a repetition period length of two radio frames and so on. The corresponding integer value indicates the offset of the repetition period in the number of radio frames. MCCH is scheduled in radio frames for which: SFN mod repetition period length \( = \) offset of the repetition period.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcch-WindowStartSlot \\
Indicates the slot in which MCCH transmission window starts.
