5.5 Measurements
5.5.1 Introduction

The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements. The network may configure the UE to report them in accordance with the measurement configuration or perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation in accordance with the conditional reconfiguration. The measurement configuration is provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e. using the RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume.

The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of measurements:
- NR measurements;
- Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies;
- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA-FDD frequencies;
- NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on SS/PBCH block(s):
- Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;
- Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);
- SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on CSI-RS resources:
- Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;
- Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);
- CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.

The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of measurements for NR sidelink and V2X sidelink:
- CBR measurements.

The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement information based on SRS resources:
