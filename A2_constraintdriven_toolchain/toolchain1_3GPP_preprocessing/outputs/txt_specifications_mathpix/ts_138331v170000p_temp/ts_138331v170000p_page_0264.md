conditionalReconfiguration including the condRRCReconfig of the target PCell in the source PCell;

3> if the ratio between the value of the elapsed time of the timer T304 and the configured value of the T304 timer, included in the last applied RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync, is greater than thresholdPercentageT304 included in the successHO-Config received before executing the last reconfiguration with sync:
\( 4> \) set t304-cause in shr-Cause to true;
\( 4> \) set the ra-Information Common as specified in clause 5.7.10.5;
\( 3> \) if the ratio between the value of the elapsed time of the timer T310 and the configured value of the T310 timer, configured while the UE was connected to the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync, is greater than thresholdPercentageT310 included in the successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync:
\( 4> \) set \( t 310 \)-cause in shr-Cause to true;
\( 3> \) if the ratio between the value of the elapsed time of the timer T312 and the configured value of the T312 timer, configured while the UE was connected to the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync, is greater than thresholdPercentageT312 included in the successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync:
\( 4> \) set t312-cause in shr-Cause to true;
\( 3> \) if sourceDAPS-FailureReporting included in the successHO-Config configured by the source PCell before executing the last reconfiguration with sync is set to true, and if the last executed handover was a DAPS handover and if an RLF occurred at the source PCell during the DAPS handover while T304 was running:
\( 4> \) set sourceDAPS-Failure in shr-Cause to true;
\( 3> \) for each of the measObjectNR, configured by the source PCell, in which the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was applied:

4 if measurements are available for the measObjectNR:
\( 5> \) if the SS/PBCH block-based measurement quantities are available:
6> set the measResultListNR in measResultNeighCells to include all the available measurement quantities of the best measured cells, other than the source PCell or target PCell, ordered such that the cell with highest SS/PBCH block RSRP is listed first if SS/PBCH block RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise the cell with highest SS/PBCH block RSRQ is listed first if SS/PBCH block RSRQ measurement results are available, otherwise the cell with highest SS/PBCH block SINR is listed first, based on the available SS/PBCH block based measurements collected up to the moment the UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 6> \) for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are available;
\( 5> \) if the CSI-RS measurement quantities are available:
6> set the measResultListNR in measResultNeighCells to include all the available measurement quantities of the best measured cells, other than the source PCell and target PCell, ordered such that the cell with highest CSI-RS RSRP is listed first if CSI-RS RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise the cell with highest CSI-RS RSRQ is listed first if CSI-RS RSRQ measurement results are available, otherwise the cell with highest CSI-RS SINR is listed first, based on the available CSI-RS based measurements collected up to the moment the UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 6> \) for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are available;
\( 3> \) for each of the measObjectEUTRA, configured by the source PCell in which the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was applied:
