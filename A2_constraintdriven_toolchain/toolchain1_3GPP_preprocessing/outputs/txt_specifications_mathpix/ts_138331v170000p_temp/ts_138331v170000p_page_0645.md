\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline NTN-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ephemerisinfo \\
This field provides satellite ephemeris either in format of position and velocity state vector or in format of orbital parameters. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of XXX should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
epoch Time \\
Indicate the epoch time for assistance information (i.e. Serving satellite ephemeris in IE ephemerisInfo and Common TA parameters). When explicitly provided through SIB, or through dedicated signaling, EpochTime is the starting time of a DL sub-frame, indicated by a SFN and a sub-frame number signaled together with the assistance information. The reference point for epoch time of the serving satellite ephemeris and Common TA parameters is the uplink time synchronization reference point. If this field is absent, the epoch time is the end of SI window where this SIB19 is scheduled. This field is mandatory present when provided in dedicated configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellSpecificKoffset \\
The CellSpecific_K_offset is a scheduling offset used for the timing relationships that need to be modified for NTN [see TS 38.2xy]. The unit of K_offset is number of slots for a given subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz . FFS other SCS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
kmac \\
\( \mathrm{K} \_\mathrm{mac} \) is a scheduling offset provided by network if downlink and uplink frame timing are not aligned at gNB. It is needed for UE action and assumption on downlink configuration indicated by a MAC-CE command in PDSCH [see TS 38.2xy]. When UE is not provided by network with a K_mac value, UE assumes K_mac \( =0 \). \\
For the reference subcarrier spacing value for the unit of K_mac in FR1, a value of 15 kHz is used. The unit of K_mac is number of slots for a given subcarrier spacing. FFS other SCS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ntn-PolarizationDL \\
If present, this parameter indicates polarization information for Downlink transmission on service link: including Right hand, Left hand circular polarizations (RHCP, LHCP) and Linear polarization.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ntn-PolarizationUL \\
If present, this parameter indicates Polarization information for Uplink service link. \\
If not present and ntnPolarizationDL is present, UE assumes a same polarization for UL and DL.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ntn-UISyncValidityDuration \\
A validity duration configured by the network for uplink synchronization assistance information (i.e. Serving satellite ephemeris and Common TA parameters) which indicates the maximum time during which the UE can apply assistance information without having acquired new assistance information. \\
The unit of ntn-UlSyncValidityDuration is second. This parameter applies to both connected and idle mode UEs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ta-Common \\
TACommon is a network-controlled common timing advanced value and it may include any timing offset considered necessary by the network. TACommon with value of 0 is supported. The granularity of TACommon is \( 4.07 \times 10^{\wedge}(-3) \mu \mathrm{s} \). Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of XXX should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1."
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
taCommonDrift \\
Indicate drift rate of the common TA. The granularity of TACommonDrift is \( 0.2 \times 10^{\wedge}(-3) \mu \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{s} \) Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of XXX should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of value Tag in SIB1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
taCommonDriftVariant \\
Indicate drift rate variation of the common TA. The granularity of TACommonDriftVariation is \( 0.2 \times 10^{\wedge}(-4) \mu \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{s}^{\wedge} 2 \). Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of XXX should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of value Tag in SIB1.
\end{tabular} \\

- NZP-CSI-RS-Resource

The IE NZP-CSI-RS-Resource is used to configure Non-Zero-Power (NZP) CSI-RS transmitted in the cell where the IE is included, which the UE may be configured to measure on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.3.1). A change of configuration between periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic for an NZP-CSI-RS-Resource is not supported without a release and add.
