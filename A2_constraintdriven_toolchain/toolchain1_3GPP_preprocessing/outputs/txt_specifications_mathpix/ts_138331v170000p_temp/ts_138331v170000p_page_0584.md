\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MAC-CellGroupConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active \\
Used to control the CSI/SRS transmission during MBS multicast DRX active time, see TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-Mask \\
If set to true, the UE limits CSI reports to the on-duration period of the DRX cycle, see TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
datalnactivityTimer \\
Releases the RRC connection upon data inactivity as specified in clause 5.3.8.5 and in TS 38.321 [3]. Value s1 corresponds to 1 second, value s2 corresponds to 2 seconds, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-Config, drx-ConfigExt \\
Used to configure DRX as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup \\
Used to configure DRX related parameters for the second DRX group as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The network does not configure secondary DRX group with DCP simultaneously nor secondary DRX group with a dormant BWP simultaneously.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-ConfigSL \\
Used to configure additional DRX parameters for the UE performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
g-RNTI-ToAddModList \\
List of G-RNTI configurations to add or modify.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
g-RNTI-ToReleaseList \\
List of G-RNTI configurations to release.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
g-CS-RNTI-ToAddModList \\
List of G-CS-RNTI configurations to add or modify.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
g-RNTI-ToReleaseList \\
List of G-CS-RNTI configurations to release.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intraCG-Prioritization \\
Used to enable HARQ process ID selection based on LCH-priority for one CG as sepcfied in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ich-BasedPrioritization \\
If this field is present, the corresponding MAC entity of the UE is configured with prioritization between overlapping grants and between scheduling request and overlapping grants based on LCH priority, see TS 38.321 [3]. The network does not configure ich-BasedPrioritization with enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic simultaneously nor khBasedPrioritization with enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured simultaneously.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
offsetThresholdTA \\
Offset for TA reporting as specified in TS 38.321.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scheduling RequestiD-BFR-SCell \\
Indicates the scheduling request configuration applicable for BFR on SCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
schedulingRequestID-BFR-r17 \\
Indicates the scheduling request configuration (SchedulingRequestConfig) that the UE shall use upon detecting a beam failure on the detection resources configured in BFDset of a serving cell but not on resources configured in BFDset2 of the same serving cell. \\
Editor's note: BFDset and BFDset2 configuration is pending on LS response from RAN1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
schedulingRequestID-BFR2-r17 \\
Indicates the scheduling request configuration (SchedulingRequestConfig) that the UE shall use upon detecting a beam failure on the detection resources configured in BFDset2 of a serving cell but not on resources configured in BFDset of the same serving cell. \\
Editor's note: BFDset and BFDset2 configuration is pending on LS response from RAN1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scheduling RequestiD-LBT-SCell \\
Indicates the scheduling request configuration applicable for consistent uplink LBT recovery on SCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
skipUplinkTxDynamic, enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic, enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured \\
If set to true, the UE skips UL transmissions as described in TS 38.321 [3]. If the UE is configured with enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic or enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured with value true, REPETITION_NUMBER (as specified in TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.4.2.1) of the corresponding PUSCH transmission of the uplink grant shall be equal to 1.
