\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PDCP-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
multicastHFN-AndRefSN \\
Indicates the initial value of HFN and referrence PDCP SN associated to this HFN for multicast MRB PDCP window initialization as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The value is composed of a HFN(MSBs) and the PDCP SN(LSBs). The size of the HFN part in bits is equal to 32 minus the length of the PDCP SN configured in pdcp-SN-SizeDL.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
outOfOrderDelivery \\
Indicates whether or not outOfOrderDelivery specified in TS 38.323 [5] is configured. This field should be either always present or always absent, after the radio bearer is established.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcp-Duplication \\
Indicates whether or not uplink duplication status at the time of receiving this IE is configured and activated as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The presence of this field indicates that duplication is configured. PDCP duplication is not configured for CA packet duplication of LTE RLC bearer. The value of this field, when the field is present, indicates the state of the duplication at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, duplication is activated. The value of this field is always true, when configured for a SRB. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities for UL transmission, this field is always present. If the field moreThanTwoRLC-DRB is present, the value of this field is ignored and the state of the duplication is indicated by duplicationState. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities, only NR RLC bearer is supported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcp-SN-SizeDL \\
PDCP sequence number size for downlink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len 12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcp-SN-SizeUL \\
PDCP sequence number size for uplink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len 12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
primaryPath \\
Indicates the cell group ID and LCID of the primary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.2.1 for UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. In this version of the specification, only cell group ID corresponding to MCG is supported for SRBs, except for the SRB2 of the IAB-MT, and, when the SCG is deactivated, for DRBs. The NW indicates cellGroup for split bearers using logical channels in different cell groups. The NW always indicates logicalChannel if CA based PDCP duplication is configured in the cell group indicated by cellGroup of this field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
splitSecondaryPath \\
Indicates the LCID of the split secondary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5] for fallback to split bearer operation when UL data transmission with more than two RLC entities is associated with the PDCP entity. This RLC entity belongs to a cell group that is different from the cell group indicated by cellGroup in the field primaryPath.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
statusReportRequired \\
For AM DRBs, AM MRBs and DAPS UM DRBs, indicates whether the DRB or the multicast MRB is configured to send a PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For DAPS AM DRBs, it also indicates whether the DRB is configured to send a second PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
survivalTimeStateSupport \\
Indicates whether the DRB associated with this PDCP entity has survival time state support. If this field is configured to be true, all associated RLC entities are activated for PDCP duplication upon reception of a retransmission grant, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t-Reordering \\
Value in ms of t-Reordering specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value \( m s 0 \) corresponds to 0 ms , value \( m s 20 \) corresponds to 20 ms , value \( m s 40 \) corresponds to 40 ms , and so on. When the field is absent the UE applies the value infinity. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ul-DataSplitThreshold \\
Parameter specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value \( b 0 \) corresponds to 0 bytes, value \( b 100 \) corresponds to 100 bytes, value \( b 200 \) corresponds to 200 bytes, and so on. The network sets this field to infinity for UEs not supporting splitDRB-withUL-Both-MCG-SCG and when the SCG is deactivated. If the field is absent when the split bearer is configured for the radio bearer first time, then the default value infinity is applied.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkDataCompression \\
Indicates the UDC configuration that the UE shall apply. Network does not configure uplinkDataCompression for a DRB, if headerCompression or ethernetHeaderCompression is already configured or outOforderDelivery or DAPS is configured for the DRB. The maximum number of DRBs where uplinkDataCompression can be applied is two. The network reconfigures uplinkDataCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment, and without any drb-ContinueUDC.
