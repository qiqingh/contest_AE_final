\( 2> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and uses the frequency included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message:
\( 3> \) if the UE is acting as NR sidelink U2N Relay UE, and if the NR sidelink U2N Relay UE threshold conditions as specified in 5.8.14.2 are met based on sl-RelayUE-Config; or

3> if the UE is selecting NR sidelink U2N Relay UE/ has a selected NR sidelink U2N Relay UE, and if the NR sidelink U2N Remote UE threshold conditions as specified in 5.8.15.2 are met based on \( s / \) -RemoteUE-Config; or

3> if the UE is performing NR sidelink non-relay discovery:
4> if the UE is configured with \( s \) /-ScheduledConfig:
\( 5> \) if T310 for MCG or T311 is running; and if \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional is included in sl-FreqInfoList for the concerned frequency in SIB12 or included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR in RRCReconfiguration; or
\( 5> \) if T301 is running and the cell on which the UE initiated RRC connection re-establishment provides SIB12 including sl-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency; or
\( 5> \) if T304 for MCG is running and the UE is configured with \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional included in \( s l \) ConfigDedicatedNR for the concerned frequency in RRCReconfiguration:
\( 6> \) configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 2 based on random selection using the resource pool indicated by sl-TxPoolExceptional as defined in TS 38.321 [3];
\( 5> \) else:
6> configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 1 using the resource pool indicated by sl-DiscTxPoolScheduling or sl-TxPoolScheduling for NR sidelink discovery transmission on the concerned frequency in RRCReconfiguration;

5> if T311 is running, configure the lower layers to release the resources indicated by rrcConfiguredSidelinkGrant (if any);

4> if the UE is configured with sl-UE-SelectedConfig:
\( 5> \) if a result of sensing on the resources configured in \( s l \)-DiscTxPoolSelected or \( s l \) -
TxPoolSelectedNormal for NR sidelink discovery transmission on the concerned frequency included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration is not available in accordance with TS 38.214 [19];
\( 6> \) if \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency is included in RRCReconfiguration; or
6> if the PCell provides SIB12 including sl-TxPoolExceptional in sl-FreqInfoList for the concerned frequency:

\( 5> \) else, if the \( s \)-DiscTxPoolSelected for NR sidelink discovery transmission on the concerned frequency is included in the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 6> \) configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 2 based on sensing (as defined in TS 38.321 [3] and TS 38.214 [19]) using the pools of resources indicated by \( s i \) DiscTxPoolSelected for NR sidelink discovery transmission on the concerned frequency in RRCReconfiguration;
\( 5> \) else, if the \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal for NR sidelink discovery transmission on the concerned frequency is included in the \( s \) /-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 6> \) configure lower layers to perform the sidelink resource allocation mode 2 based on sensing (as defined in TS 38.321 [3] and TS 38.214 [19]) using the pools of resources indicated by \( s i \) -
