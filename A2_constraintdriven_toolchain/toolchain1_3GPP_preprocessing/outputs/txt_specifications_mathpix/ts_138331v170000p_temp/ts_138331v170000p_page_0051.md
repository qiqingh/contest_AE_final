4> forward the trackingAreaCode to upper layers;
4> forward the trackingAreaList to upper layers, if included;
4> forward the received posSIB-MappingInfo to upper layers, if included;
4> forward the PLMN identity or SNPN identity or PNI-NPN identity to upper layers;
4> if in RRC_INACTIVE and the forwarded information does not trigger message transmission by upper layers:
\( 5> \) if the serving cell does not belong to the configured ran-NotificationArealnfo:
\( 6> \) initiate an RNA update as specified in 5.3.13.8;
4> forward the ims-EmergencySupport to upper layers, if present;
4> forward the eCallOverIMS-Support to upper layers, if present;
4> forward the UAC-AccessCategoryl-SelectionAssistanceInfo or UAC-ACI-SelectAssistInfo for the selected PLMN/SNPN to upper layers, if present and set to \( a, b \) or \( c \);

4- if the UE is in SNPN access mode:
5> forward the imsEmergencySupportForSNPN indicators with the corresponding SNPN identities to upper layers, if present;

4> apply the configuration included in the servingCellConfigCommon;
\( 4> \) apply the specified PCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.3;
4> if the UE has a stored valid version of a SIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, that the UE requires to operate within the cell in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:
\( 5> \) use the stored version of the required SIB;
\( 4> \) if the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required \( \mathrm{SIB}(\mathrm{s}) \), in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:

5> for the SI message(s) that, according to the si-SchedulingInfo, contain at least one required SIB and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to broadcasting:
\( 6> \) acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2;
\( 5> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the si-SchedulingInfo, contain at least one required SIB and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting:
\( 6> \) trigger a request to acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.3;
4> if the UE has a stored valid version of a posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required posSIB(s), in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:
\( 5> \) use the stored version of the required posSIB;
\( 4> \) if the UE has not stored a valid version of a posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:
\( 5> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the posSI-SchedulingInfo, contain at least one requested posSIB and for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to broadcasting:
\( 6> \) acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2;
5> for the SI message(s) that, according to the posSI-SchedulingInfo, contain at least one requested posSIB for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting:
\( 6> \) trigger a request to acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.3a;
