\( 3> \) else if the UE changes PSCell, or attempts to change PSCell but fails, at the same time as the change of the PCell in RRC_CONNECTED:

4> include an entry in visitedPSCelllnfoList in variable VarMobilityHistoryReport possibly after removing the oldest entry, if necessary, according to following:
\( 5> \) if the global cell identity of the previous PSCell is available:
\( 6> \) include the global cell identity of that cell in the field visitedCellld of the entry;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) include the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of that cell in the field visitedCellld of the entry;
\( 5> \) set the field timeSpent of the entry as the time spent in the PSCell, while being connected to previous PCell;
\( 3> \) if the UE was not configured with a PSCell at the time of change of PCell in RRC_CONNECTED:
4> include an entry in visitedPSCellInfoList after removing the oldest entry, if necessary, according to the following;
\( 5> \) set the field timeSpent of the entry as the time without PSCell according to the following:
6> if the UE experienced a PSCell release or secondary cell radio link failure since entering the previous PCell in RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 7> \) include the time spent with no PSCell since last PSCell release or secondary cell radio link failure since entering the previous PCell in RRC_CONNECTED;
\( 3> \) if visitedPSCelllnfoList exists in VarMobilityHistoryReport:
\( 4> \) include visitedPSCellInfoList in the visitedCellInfoList of the variable VarMobilityHistoryReport associating it with the latest PCell entry;
\( 4> \) remove visitedPSCelllnfoList from the variable VarMobilityHistoryReport;
1> upon entering 'camped normally' state in NR (in RRC_[DLE or RRC_INACTIVE) or E-UTRA (in RRC_IDLE) while previously in RRC_CONNECTED state NR or LTE while not connected to a PSCell:
\( 2> \) include an entry in visitedPSCellInfoList after removing the oldest entry, if necessary, according to the following;
\( 3> \) set the field timeSpent of the entry as the time without PSCell according to the following:
4- if the UE experienced a PSCell release or secondary cell radio link failure since entering the current PCell in RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 5> \) include the time spent with no PSCell since last PSCell release or SCG radio link failure after entering the current PCell in RRC_CONNECTED.

1> upon entering 'camped normally' state in NR (in RRC_[DLE or RRC_INACTIVE) or E-UTRA (in RRC_IDLE) while previously in 'any cell selection' state or 'camped on any cell' state in NR or LTE:
\( 2> \) include an entry in variable VarMobilityHistoryReport possibly after removing the oldest entry, if necessary, according to following:
\( 3> \) set the field timeSpent of the entry as the time spent in 'any cell selection' state and/or 'camped on any cell' state in NR or LTE.
