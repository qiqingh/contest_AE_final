\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BWP-DownlinkDedicated field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamFailureRecoverySCellConfig \\
Configuration of candidate RS for beam failure recovery in SCells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cfr-ConfigMulticast \\
UE specific common frequency resource configuration for MBS multicast for one dedicated BWP. This field can be configured within at most one serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deactivatedMeasGapList \\
Indicates a list of gap IDs where the corresponding pre-configured measurement gaps (i.e. the gaps configured with preConfig/nd) are deactivated upon the switch to this BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-FeedbackEnablingforSPSactive \\
If enabled, UE reports ACK/NACK for the first SPS PDSCH after activation, regardless of if HARQ feedback is enabled or disabled corresponding to the first SPS PDSCH after activation. Otherwise, UE follows configuration of HARQ feedback enabled/disabled corresponding to the first SPS PDSCH after activation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nonCellDefiningSSB-r17 \\
If configured, the UE operating in this BWP uses this SSB for the purposes for which it would otherwise have used the cell-defining SSB of the serving cell (e.g. obtaining sync, measurements (FFS on measurements), RLM,...). Furthermore, other parts of the BWP configuration that refer to an SSB (e.g. the "SSB" configured in the QCL-Info IE; the "ssb-Index" configured in the RadioLinkMonitoringRS; CFRA-SSB-Resource; PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR) refer implicitily to this NCD-SSB. \\
The NCD-SSB has the same values for the properties (e.g., ssb-PositionsInBurst, PCI, ssb-periodicity, ssb-PBCH-BlockPower) of the corresponding CD-SSB apart from the values of the properties configured in the NonCellDefiningSSB-r17 IE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-Config \\
UE specific PDCCH configuration for one BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-Config \\
UE specific PDSCH configuration for one BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-Config \\
UE specific SPS (Semi-Persistent Scheduling) configuration for one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure sps-Config when there is an active configured downlink assignment (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the sps-Config at any time. Network can only configure SPS in one BWP using either this field or sps-ConfigToAddModList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList \\
Indicates a list of the deactivation states in which each state can be mapped to a single or multiple SPS configurations to be deactivated, see clause 10.2 in TS 38.213 [13]. If a state is mapped to multiple SPS configurations, each of these SPS configurations is configured with the same harq-Codebook/D.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-ConfigToAddModList \\
Indicates a list of one or more DL SPS configurations to be added or modified in one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure a SPS configuration when it is active (see TS 38.321 [3]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-ConfigToReleaseList \\
Indicates a list of one or more DL SPS configurations to be released. The NW may release a SPS configuration at any time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
radioLinkMonitoringConfig \\
UE specific configuration of radio link monitoring for detecting cell- and beam radio link failure occasions. The maximum number of failure detection resources should be limited up to 8 for both cell and beam radio link failure detection. For SCells, only periodic 1-port CSI-RS can be configured in IE RadioLinkMonitoringConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PDCCH-Config \\
Indicates the UE specific PDCCH configurations for receiving the SL grants (via SL-RNTI or SL-CS-RNTI) for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-V2X-PDCCH-Config \\
Indicates the UE specific PDCCH configurations for receiving SL grants (i.e. sidelink SPS) for V2X sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
