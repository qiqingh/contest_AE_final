Figure B2-1: BWP\#0 configuration without dedicated configuration

With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP\#0 is considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot be configured with BWP\#1 in addition to BWP\#0 when using this configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP\#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the BWP\#0 (compared to the first option).

Figure B2-2: BWP\#0 configuration with dedicated configuration

For BWP\#0, the BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
