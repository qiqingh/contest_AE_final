\( 1> \) if the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in slConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12, and sl-SyncPriority is configured for the concerned frequency and set to gnbEnb:
\( 2> \) select a cell as the synchronization reference source as defined in 5.8.6.3:
\( 1> \) else if the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in \( s \)-FreqInfoToAddModList in \( s \) ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-ConfigCommonNR within SIB12, and sl-SyncPriority for the concerned frequency is not configured or is set to gnss, and GNSS is reliable in accordance with TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.133 [14]:
\( 2> \) select GNSS as the synchronization reference source;
\( 1> \) else if the frequency used for NR sidelink communication is included in SL-PreconfigurationNR, and slSyncPriority in SidelinkPreconfigNR is set to gnss and GNSS is reliable in accordance with TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.133 [14]:
\( 2> \) select GNSS as the synchronization reference source;
1> else:
\( 2> \) perform a full search (i.e covering all subframes and all possible SLSSIDs) to detect candidate SLSS, in accordance with TS 38.133 [14]
\( 2> \) when evaluating the one or more detected SLSSIDs, apply layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 using the preconfigured sl-filterCoefficient, before using the PSBCH-RSRP measurement results;
\( 2> \) if the UE has selected a SyncRef UE:
3> if the PSBCH-RSRP of the strongest candidate SyncRef UE exceeds the minimum requirement TS 38.133 [14] by sl-SyncRefMinHyst and the strongest candidate SyncRef UE belongs to the same priority group as the current SyncRef UE and the PSBCH-RSRP of the strongest candidate SyncRef UE exceeds the PSBCH-RSRP of the current SyncRef UE by syncRefDiffHyst; or

3> if the PSBCH-RSRP of the candidate SyncRef UE exceeds the minimum requirement TS 38.133 [14] by sl-SyncRefMinHyst and the candidate SyncRef UE belongs to a higher priority group than the current SyncRefUE; or

3> if GNSS becomes reliable in accordance with TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.133 [14], and GNSS belongs to a higher priority group than the current SyncRef UE; or
\( 3> \) if a cell is detected and gNB/eNB (if sl-NbAsSync is set to true) belongs to a higher priority group than the current SyncRef UE; or

3> if the PSBCH-RSRP of the current SyncRef UE is less than the minimum requirement defined in TS 38.133 [14]:

4> consider no SyncRef UE to be selected;
2 if the UE has selected GNSS as the synchronization reference for NR sidelink communication:
3> if the PSBCH-RSRP of the candidate SyncRef UE exceeds the minimum requirement defined in TS 38.133 [14] by sl-SyncRefMinHyst and the candidate SyncRef UE belongs to a higher priority group than GNSS; or

3> if GNSS becomes not reliable in accordance with TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.133 [14]:
4> consider GNSS not to be selected;
\( 2> \) if the UE has selected cell as the synchronization reference for NR sidelink communication:
3> if the PSBCH-RSRP of the candidate SyncRef UE exceeds the minimum requirement defined in TS 38.133 [14] by sl-SyncRefMinHyst and the candidate SyncRef UE belongs to a higher priority group than gNB/eNB; or

3> if the selected cell is not detected:
