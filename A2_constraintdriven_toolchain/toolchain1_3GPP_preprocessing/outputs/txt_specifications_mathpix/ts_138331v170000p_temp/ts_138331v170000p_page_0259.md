\( 2> \) if the successHO-Report in the VarSuccessHO-Report concerns a DAPS handover:
3> set upInterruptionTimeAtHO in VarSuccessHO-Report to include the time elapsed between the time of arrival of the last PDCP PDU received from the source cell of the concerned handover and the time of arrival of the first non-duplicate PDCP PDU received from the target cell of the concerned handover, as measured at the time of arrival of the first non-duplicate PDCP PDU received from the target cell
\( 2> \) set the successHO-Report in the UEInformationResponse message to the value of successHO-Report in the VarSuccessHO-Report, if available;
\( 2> \) discard the VarSuccessHO-Report upon successful delivery of the UEInformationResponse message confirmed by lower layers;
\( 1> \) if the logMeasReport is included in the UEInformationResponse:
\( 2> \) submit the UEInformationResponse message to lower layers for transmission via SRB2;
\( 2> \) discard the logged measurement entries included in the logMeasInfoList from VarLogMeasReport upon successful delivery of the UEInformationResponse message confirmed by lower layers;

\( 2> \) submit the UEInformationResponse message to lower layers for transmission via SRB1.
5.7.10.4 Actions upon successful completion of a random-access procedure or on successful or unsuccessful completion of a procedure for request of ondemand system information

Upon successfully performing random-access procedure initialized with 4-step or 2-step RA type, or upon failed or successfully completed on-demand system information acquisition procedure, the UE shall:

1> if the RPLMN or the PLMN selected by upper layers (see TS24.501 [23]) from the PLMN(s) included in the plmn-IdentityList in SIBI is not included in plmn-IdentityList stored in a non-empty VarRA-Report:
\( 2> \) clear the information included in VarRA-Report;
\( 1> \) if the number of \( R A \)-Report entries stored in the ra-ReportList in VarRA-Report is less than maxRAReport:
\( 2> \) if the number of PLMN entries in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRA-Report is less than maxPLMN; or
\( 2> \) if the number of PLMN entries in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRA-Report is equal to maxPLMN and the list of EPLMNs is subset of or equal to the plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRA-Report:

3> append the following contents associated to the successfully completed random-access procedure as a new entry in the VarRA-Report:

4> if the list of EPLMNs has been stored by the UE:
\( 5> \) set the plmn-IdentityList to include the list of EPLMNs stored by the UE (i.e. includes the RPLMN) without exceeding the limit of maxPLMN;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) set the pimn-Identity, in plmn-IdentityList, to the PLMN selected by upper layers (see TS 24.501
[23]) from the PLMN(s) included in the plmn-IdentityInfoList in SIB1;
4> set the cellld to the global cell identity and the tracking area code, if available, otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the cell in which the corresponding random-access preamble was transmitted;

4> if the corresponding random-access procedure was performed on an SCell of MCG:
\( 5> \) set the spCellld to the global cell identity of the PCell;
\( 4> \) if the corresponding random-access procedure was performed on an SCell of SCG:
