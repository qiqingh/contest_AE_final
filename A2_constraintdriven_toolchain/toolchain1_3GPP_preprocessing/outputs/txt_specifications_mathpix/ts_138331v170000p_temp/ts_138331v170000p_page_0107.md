ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

\( 3> \) consider itself not to be configured to provide its SCG deactivation preference and stop timer T346i, if running.
5.3.5.10 MR-DC release

The UE shall:
1> as a result of MR-DC release triggered by E-UTRA or NR:
\( 2> \) release SRB3, if established, as specified in 5.3.5.6.2;
\( 2> \) release measConfig associated with SCG;
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured with NR SCG:
3> release the SCG configuration as specified in clause 5.3.5.4;
3> release otherConfig associated with the SCG, if configured;
3> stop timers T346a, T346b, T346c, T346d, T346e, T346j and T346k associated with the SCG, if running;
3> release bap-Config associated with the SCG, if configured;
3> release iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList associated with the SCG, if configured;
\( 2> \) else if the UE is configured with E-UTRA SCG:
3> release the SCG configuration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.10.19 to release the E-UTRA SCG;
5.3.5.11 Full configuration

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) release/ clear all current dedicated radio configurations except for the following:
- the MCG C-RNTI;
- the AS security configurations associated with the master key;
- the SRB1/SRB2 configurations and DRB/multicast MRB configurations as configured by radioBearerConfig or radioBearerConfig2.

NOTE 1: Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but includes other configurations like MeasConfig. Radio configuration also includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by RLCBearerConfig. In case NR-DC or NE-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR or E-UTRA SCG configuration which are released according to the MR-DC release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.10.

NOTE 1a: For NR sidelink communication, the radio configuration includes the sidelink RRC configuration received from the network, but does not include the sidelink RRC reconfiguration and sidelink UE capability received from other UEs via PC5-RRC. In addition, the UE considers the new NR sidelink configurations as full configuration, in case of state transition and change of system information used for NR sidelink communication.

NOTE 1b: To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to fullConfig, the network can include the srbIdentity within srb-ToAddModList (i.e. the UE applies RLC default configuration) and/or provide ricBearerToAddModList of concerned SRB(s) explicitly.
- the logged measurement configuration;
\( 1> \) if the spCellConfig in the masterCellGroup includes the reconfigurationWithSync:
\( 2> \) release/ clear all current common radio configurations;
\( 2> \) use the default values specified in 9.2.3 for timers T310, T311 and constants N310, N311;
