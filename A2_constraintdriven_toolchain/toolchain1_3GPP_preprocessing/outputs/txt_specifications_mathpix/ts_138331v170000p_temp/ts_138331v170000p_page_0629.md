nrofSlotsMsgA-PUSCH
Number of slots (in active UL BWP numerology) containing one or multiple PUSCH occasions, each slot has the same time domain resource allocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A).
startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO
An index giving valid combinations of start symbol, length and mapping type as start and length indicator (SLIV) for the first msgA PUSCH occasion, for RRC_CONNECTED UEs in non-initial BWP as described in TS 38.214 [19] clause 6.1.2. The network configures the field so that the allocation does not cross the slot boundary. The number of occupied symbols excludes the guard period. If the field is absent, the UE shall use the value in msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A). The network configures one of msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation and startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, but not both. If the field is absent, the UE shall use the value of msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation.

\hline MsgA-DMRS-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-DMRS-AdditionalPosition \\
Indicates the position for additional DM-RS. If the field is absent, the UE applies value pos2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-MaxLength \\
indicates single-symbol or double-symbol DMRS. If the field is absent, the UE applies value len1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PUSCH-DMRS-CDM-Group \\
1-bit indication of indices of CDM group(s). If the field is absent, then both CDM groups are used.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts \\
0 indicates 1 port per CDM group, 1 indicates 2 ports per CDM group. If the field is absent then 4 ports per CDM group are used (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-ScramblingIDO \\
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM. If the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellID).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-ScramblingID1 \\
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM. If the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellID).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline FreqHopConfigured & This field is mandatory present when the field msgA-IntraSlotFrequencyHopping is configured. Otherwise, the field is absent. \\
\hline GroupBConfigured & The field is mandatory present if groupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA is configured in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA, otherwise the field is absent. \\
\hline InitialBWPConfig & The field is mandatory present when \( M \) sgA-ConfigCommon is configured for the initial uplink BWP, or when MsgAConfigCommon is configured for a non-initial uplink BWP and MsgA-ConfigCommon is not configured for the initial uplink BWP, otherwise the field is optionally present, Need S. \\
