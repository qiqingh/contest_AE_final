5.2.2 System information acquisition
5.2.2.1 General UE requirements

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition

The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.

The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at least) the \( M I B, S I B l \) through SIB4, SIB5 (if the UE supports E-UTRA), SIBII (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), SIB12 (if UE is capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery), and SIB13, SIB14 (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication), SIB16 (if the UE is configured for slice specific cell reselection information), SIB19 (if UE is accessing NR via satellite access).

The UE capable of MBS broadcast which is receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) via a broadcast MRB shall ensure having a valid version of SIB20 and SIB21, regardless of the RRC state the UE is in.

The UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper layers.
5.2.2.2 SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
5.2.2.2.1 SIB validity

The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of a requested SIB.

When the UE acquires a \( M I B \) or a \( S I B I \) or an SI message in a serving cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentitylnfoList for NPN-only cells, the cellldentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, and the valueTag, if present, as indicated in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB. If the UE stores the acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the cellldentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, the valueTag, if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, and the expirationTime if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except MIB, SIBI, SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8 e g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change indication. The valueTag and expirationTime for posSIB is optionally provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, as specified in TS 37.355 [49].

NOTE: The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid;
