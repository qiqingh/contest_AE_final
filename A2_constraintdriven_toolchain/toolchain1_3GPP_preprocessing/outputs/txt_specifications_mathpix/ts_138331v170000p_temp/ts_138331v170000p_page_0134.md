NOTE 2: Periods in time where neither "in-sync" nor "out-of-sync" is reported by L1 do not affect the evaluation of the number of consecutive "in-sync" or "out-of-sync" indications.
5.3.10.3 Detection of radio link failure

The UE shall:
1> if any DAPS bearer is configured and T304 is running:
\( 2> \) upon T310 expiry in source SpCell; or
\( 2> \) upon random access problem indication from source MCG MAC; or
\( 2> \) upon indication from source MCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached; or
\( 2> \) upon consistent uplink LBT failure indication from source MCG MAC:
3> consider radio link failure to be detected for the source MCG i.e. source RLF;
3> suspend the transmission and reception of all DRBs and multicast MRBs in the source MCG;
\( 3> \) reset MAC for the source MCG ;
3> release the source connection.
1> else:
\( 2> \) during a DAPS handover: the following only applies for the target PCell;
\( 2> \) upon T310 expiry in PCell; or
\( 2> \) upon T312 expiry in PCell; or
\( 2> \) upon random access problem indication from MCG MAC while neither T300, T301, T304, T311 nor T319 are running; or
\( 2> \) upon indication from MCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached; or
\( 2> \) if connected as an [AB-node, upon BH RLF indication received on BAP entity from the MCG; or
\( 2> \) upon consistent uplink LBT failure indication from MCG MAC while T304 is not running:
3> if the indication is from MCG RLC and CA duplication is configured and activated for MCG, and for the corresponding logical channel allowedServingCells only includes SCell(s):
\( 4> \) initiate the failure information procedure as specified in 5.7 .5 to report RLC failure.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) consider radio link failure to be detected for the MCG, i.e. MCG RLF;
4> discard any segments of segmented RRC messages stored according to 5.7.6.3;
NOTE: Void.
4- if AS security has not been activated:
\( 5> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'other';-
4> else if AS security has been activated but SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, have not been setup:
\( 5> \) store the radio link failure information in the VarRLF-Report as described in clause 5.3.10.5;
\( 5> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'RRC connection failure';

4> else:
