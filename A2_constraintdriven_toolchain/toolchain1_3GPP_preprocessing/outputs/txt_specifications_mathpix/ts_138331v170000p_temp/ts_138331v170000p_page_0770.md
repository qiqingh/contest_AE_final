\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RLC-BearerConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
isPTM-Entity \\
If configured, indicates that the RLC entity is used for PTM reception. When the field is absent the RLC entity is used for PTP transmission/reception.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
IogicalChannelldentity \\
ID used commonly for the MAC logical channel and for the RLC bearer. Value 4 is not configured for DRBs if SRB4 is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
logicalChannelldentityExt \\
Extended logical channel ID used commonly for the MAC logical channel and for the RLC bearer for MBS multicast. If this field is configured, the UE shall ignore logicalChannelldentity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reestablishRLC \\
Indicates that RLC should be re-established. Network sets this to true at least whenever the security key used for the radio bearer associated with this RLC entity changes. For SRB2, multicast MRBs and DRBs, unless full configuration is used, it is also set to true during the resumption of the RRC connection or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. For SRB1, when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment, the network does not set this field to true.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ric-Config \\
Determines the RLC mode (UM, AM) and provides corresponding parameters. RLC mode reconfiguration can only be performed by DRB/multicast MRB release/addition or full configuration. The network may configure rc -Config-v1610 only when rc -Config (without suffix) is set to am.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servedMBS-RadioBearer \\
Associates the RLC Bearer with a multicast MRB. The UE shall deliver DL RLC SDUs received via the RLC entity of this RLC bearer to the PDCP entity of the servedMBSRadioBearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servedRadioBearer, servedRadioBearerSRB4 \\
Associates the RLC Bearer with an SRB or a DRB. The UE shall deliver DL RLC SDUs received via the RLC entity of this RLC bearer to the PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer. Furthermore, the UE shall advertise and deliver uplink PDCP PDUs of the uplink PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer to the uplink RLC entity of this RLC bearer unless the uplink scheduling restrictions (moreThanOneRLC in PDCP-Config and the restrictions in LogicalChannelConfig) forbid it to do so.
\end{tabular} \\
