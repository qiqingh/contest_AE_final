5.5.3 Performing measurements
5.5.3.1 General

An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcNO; RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2 quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the Rx-Tx time difference measurements.

The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive cell measurement results is implementation dependent.

The UE shall:
1> whenever the UE has a measConfig, perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements for each serving cell for which servingCellMO is configured as follows:
\( 2> \) if the reportConfig associated with at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig contains an rsType set to ssb and ssb-ConfigMobility is configured in the measObject indicated by the servingCellMO:
