\hline UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
codebookTypeRequest \\
Only if this field is present, the UE includes SupportedCS/-RS-Resource supported for the codebook type(s) requested within this field (i.e. type I single/multi-panel, type II and type II port selection) into codebookVariantsList, codebookParametersPerBand and codebookParametersPerBC. If this field is present and none of the codebook types is requested within this field (i.e. empty field), the UE includes SupportedCS/-RS-Resource supported for all codebook types into codebookVariantsList, codebookParametersPerBand and codebookParametersPerBC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
includeNE-DC \\
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting NE-DC shall indicate support for NE-DC in band combinations and include feature set combinations which are applicable to NEDC. Band combinations supporting both NE-DC and (NG)EN-DC shall be included in supportedBandCombinationList, band combinations supporting only NE-DC shall be included in supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
includeNR-DC \\
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting NR-DC shall indicate support for NR-DC in band combinations and include feature set combinations which are applicable to NRDC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mode \\
The mode of NR-DC operation that the NW is interested in for this cell grouping. The value sync means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports synchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping. The value async means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports asynchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
omitEN-DC \\
Only if this field is present, the UE shall omit band combinations and feature set combinations which are only applicable to (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedCellGrouping \\
The NR-DC cell groupings that the NW is interested in, i.e., the bands that it might use in an MCG and the bands that it might use in an SCG. Only if this field is present, the UE indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports the requested cell grouping, i.e., in which it supports at least one of the mcg bands on MCG and at least one of the scg bands on the SCG. In its supportedBandCombinationList, the UE indicates which of its NR-DC band combinations supports which of the requested cell groupings. The first element in this list is referred to by ID\#0, the second by ID\#1 and so on. If this field is absent, the UE only includes band combinations for which it supports NR-DC with only FR1 bands in MCG and only FR2 bands in SCG. \\
Example 1: requestedCellGrouping is set to \( m c g=[\mathrm{n} 1, \mathrm{n} 7, \mathrm{n} 41, \mathrm{n} 66] \) and \( \operatorname{scg}=[\mathrm{n} 78, \mathrm{n} 261] \). This assumes that the NW would always use CA among n 1 , \( \mathrm{n7} \), n 41 and \( \mathrm{n66} \) (depending on which are deployed on a given site) whereas with n78 and/or n261 the NW may need to use DC. With this filter a UE may report a band combination n1A-n7An78A for NR-DC only if it supports that serving cells for n 1 and n 7 are in the MCG and a serving cell for n 78 is in the SCG. The UE may also report a band combination n41Cn261M for NR-DC provided that it supports a serving cell for n41 in the MCG and a serving cell for n261 in the SCG. \\
Example 2: One requestedCellGrouping is set to \( m c g=[\mathrm{n} 1, \mathrm{n} 7, \mathrm{n} 41, \mathrm{n} 66] \) and \( \mathrm{scg}=[\mathrm{n78}, \mathrm{n261}] \) and another requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n66] and scg=[ n41, n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW uses sometimes CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (as in example 1) and sometimes CA among n1, n7 and n66 but DC towards one or several of n41, n78, n261. If a UE supports n1A-n41A-n78A only if n41A and n78A are in the same cell group, this UE may only indicate cell grouping ID\#1 (not \#0) in its BC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkTxSwitchRequest \\
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting dynamic UL Tx switching shall indicate support for UL Tx switching in band combinations which are applicable to inter-band UL CA, SUL and (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
