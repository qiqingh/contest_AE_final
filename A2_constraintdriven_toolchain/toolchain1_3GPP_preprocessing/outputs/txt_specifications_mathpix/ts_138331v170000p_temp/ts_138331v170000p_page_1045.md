\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MBS-SessioninfoList field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
g-RNTI \\
G-RNTI used to scramble the scheduling and transmission of MTCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
headerCompression \\
If rohc is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in downlink. When the field is absent the UE applies the value as specified in 9.1.1.7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mbsSessionid \\
Indicates an identifier of the MBS session provided by the MTCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrb-listBroadcast \\
A list of broadcast MRBs to which the associated broadcast MBS session is mapped to.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtch-neighbourCell \\
Indicates neighbour cells which provide this service on MTCH. The first bit is set to 1 if the service is provided on MTCH in the first cell in mbs-NeighbourCellList, otherwise it is set to 0 . The second bit is set to 1 if the service is provided on MTCH in the second cell in mbs-NeighbourCellList, and so on. If the service is not available in any neighbouring cell and \( m b s \)-NeighbourCellList is signalled, the network sets all bits in this field to 0 . If this field is absent, the related service may or may not be available in any neighbouring cell, i.e. the UE cannot determine the presence or absence of an MBS service in neighbouring cells based on the absence of this field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtch-schedulinginfo \\
Indicates the index of DRX configuration entry in drx-ConfigPTM-List that is used for scheduling the MTCH. The value 0 corresponds to the first entry in drx-ConfigPTM-List, the value 1 corresponds to the second entry in drx-ConfigPTM-List and so on. In case mtch-schedulinglnfo is absent for a G-RNTI (i.e. no PTM DRX), the UE shall monitor for PDCCH scrambled with G-RNTI in any slot according to the search space configured for MTCH [see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mtch-SSB-MappingWindowindex \\
Indicates the index of MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowCycleOffset configuration entry in MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList. The value 0 corresponds to the first entry in MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList, the value 1 corresponds to the second entry in MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList and so on. This field is set to the same value for all MBS sessions mapped to the same G-RNTI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcp-SN-SizeDL \\
Indicates that PDCP sequence number size of 12 bits is used, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. When the field is absent the UE applies the value as specified in 9.1.1.7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdschConfigindex \\
Indicates the index of PDSCH configuration entry in pdschConfigList for MTCH. Value 0 corresponds to the first entry in pdschConfigList, the value 1 corresponds to the second entry in pdschConfigList and so on. When the field is absent the UE applies the first entry in pdschConfigList for MTCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sn-FieldLength \\
Indicates that the RLC SN field size of 6 bits is used, see TS 38.322 [4]. When the field is absent the UE applies the value as specified in 9.1.1.7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t-Reassembly \\
Timer for reassembly in TS 38.322 [4], in milliseconds. Value ms 0 means 0 ms , value ms 5 means 5 ms and so on. When the field is absent the UE applies the value in specified in 9.1.1.7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t-Reordering \\
Value in ms of t -Reordering specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms 1 corresponds to 1 ms , value ms 10 corresponds to 10 ms , and so on. When the field is absent the UE applies the value as specified in 9.1.1.7.
\end{tabular} \\

- MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList

The IE MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList is used to configure MTCH PDCCH ocassions to SSB mapping window related periodic and offset parameters.
