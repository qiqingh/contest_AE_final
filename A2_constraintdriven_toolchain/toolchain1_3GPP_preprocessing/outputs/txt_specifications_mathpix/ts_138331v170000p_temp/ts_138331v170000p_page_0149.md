\( 1> \) consider the current cell to be the PCell;
1> set the content of the of RRCResumeComplete message as follows:
\( 2> \) if the upper layer provides NAS PDU, set the dedicatedNAS-Message to include the information received from upper layers;

2 if upper layers provides a PLMN:

\( 3> \) else:
4> set the selectedPLMN-Identity to the PLMN selected by upper layers from the plmn-IdentityInfoList;
\( 2> \) if the masterCellGroup contains the reportUplinkTxDirectCurrent:
