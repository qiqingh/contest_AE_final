\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline TRS-ResourceSet field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstOFDMSymbolln TimeDomain \\
The index of the first OFDM symbol in the PRB used for TRS in a slot. The field indicates first symbol in a slot, a second symbol in the same slot can be derived implicitly with symbol index as firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain+4.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyDomainAllocation \\
Indicates the offset of the first RE to RE\#0 in a RB in row1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
indBitID \\
The index of the associated bit in TRS availability indication field in DCI. Each TRS resource set is configured with an ID i for the association with (i+1)-th indication bit in TRS availability indication field in DCI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofRBs \\
Number of PRBs across which corresponding TRS resource spans.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofResources \\
The number of TRS resources for a TRS resource set.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityAndOffset \\
The periodicity and slot offset (slot) for periodicTRS. It is used to determine the location of the first slot of TRS resource set. The periodicity value slots 10 corresponds to 10 slots, value slots 20 corresponds to 20 slots, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerControlOffsetSS \\
Power offset (dB) of NZP CSI-RS RE to SSS RE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scrambling ID-info \\
One or more scrambling IDs are configured for a TRS resource set. If a common scrambling ID is configured, it applies to all the TRS resources within the TRS resource set. Otherwise, each TRS resource within the TRS resource set is provided with a scrambling ID. If the number of TRS resources for the TRS resource set is 2 , scrambling/DperResourceListWith2-r17 is configured, while scrambling/DperResourceListWith4-r17 is configured for the case that the number of TRS resources for the TRS resource set is 4.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-Index \\
The index of reference SSB with which quasi-collocation information is provided as specified in TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startingRB \\
The PRB index where corresponding TRS resource starts in relation to common resource block \#0 (CRB\#0) on the common resource block grid.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- SIB18

SIB18 contains Group IDs for Network selection (GINs) to support access using credentials from a Credentials Holder or to enable UE onboarding. SIB18 may only be present if there is at least one SNPN that supports either access using credentials from a Credentials Holder or UE onboarding.
