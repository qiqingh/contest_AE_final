\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
highSpeedDeploymentTypeFR2 \\
If the field is present, and field value is unidirectional, the UE shall assume uni-directional deployment or if field value is birectional the UE shall assume bidirectional deployment for FR2 up to \( 350 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) as specified in TS 38.133 [14].

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
highSpeedMeasCA-Scell \\
If the field is present and UE supports measurementEnhancementCA-r17, the UE shall apply the enhanced RRM requirements to SCell for carrier aggregation to support high speed up to \( 500 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. This parameter only applies to SCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
highSpeedMeasFlag \\
If the field is present and UE supports measurementEnhancement-r16, the UE shall apply the enhanced intra-NR and inter-RAT EUTRAN RRM requirements to support high speed up to \( 500 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. \\
If the field is present and UE supports intraNR-MeasurementEnhancement-r16, the UE shall apply enhanced intra-NR RRM requirement to support high speed up to \( 500 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. \\
If the field is present and UE supports interRAT-MeasurementEnhancement-r16, the UE shall apply enhanced inter-RAT EUTRAN RRM requirement to support high speed up to \( 500 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. \\
This parameter only applies to SpCell.

- Hysteresis, HysteresisLocation

The IE Hysteresis is a parameter used within the entry and leave condition of an event triggered reporting condition. The actual value is field value * 0.5 dB . The HysteresisLocation is a parameter used within entry and leave condition of a location based event triggered reporting condition. The actual value of field HysteresisLocation is field value * 10 meters.
