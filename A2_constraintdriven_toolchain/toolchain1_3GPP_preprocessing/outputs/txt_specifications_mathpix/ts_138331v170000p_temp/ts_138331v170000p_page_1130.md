\hline CG-Configinfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
alignedDRX-indication \\
This field is signalled upon MN triggered CGI reporting by the UE that requires aligned DRX configurations between the MCG and the SCG (i.e. same DRX cycle and onduration configured by MN completely contains on-duration configured by SN).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedBC-ListMRDC \\
A list of indices referring to band combinations in MR-DC capabilities from which SN is allowed to select the SCG band combination. Each entry refers to: \\
- a band combination numbered according to supportedBandCombinationList and supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch in the UE-MRDC-Capability (in case of (NG)EN-DC), or according to supportedBandCombinationList and supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only in the UE-MRDC-Capability (in case of NE-DC), or according to supportedBand CombinationList in the UE-NR-Capability (in case of NR-DC), \\
- and the Feature Sets allowed for each band entry. All MR-DC band combinations indicated by this field comprise the MCG band combination, which is a superset of the MCG band(s) selected by MN.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedReducedConfigForOverheating \\
Indicates the reduced configuration that the SCG is allowed to configure. \\
reducedMaxCCs in allowedReducedConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum number of downlink/uplink PSCell/SCells that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC. \\
reducedMaxBW-FR1 and reducedMaxBW-FR2 in allowedReduced ConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum aggregated bandwidth across all downlink/uplink carriers of FR1 and FR2-1, respectively that the SCG is allowed to configure. reducedMaxBW-FR2 in allowedReduced ConfigForOverheating-r17 indicates the maximum aggregated bandwidth across all downlink/uplink carriers of FR2-2 that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is only used in NR-DC. \\
reducedMaxMIMO-LayersFR1 and reducedMaxMIMO-LayersFR2 in allowedReducedConfigForOverheating indicates the maximum number of downlink/uplink MIMO layers of each serving cell operating on FR1 and FR2-1, respectively that the SCG is allowed to configure. reducedMaxMIMO-LayersFR2-2 in allowedReducedConfigForOverheatingr17 indicates the maximum number of downlink/uplink MIMO layers of each serving cell operating on FR2-2 that the SCG is allowed to configure. This field is only used in NRDC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCellinfoListMN, candidateCellinfoListSN \\
Contains information regarding cells that the master node or the source node suggests the target gNB or DU to consider configuring. In case of MN initiated CPA or CPC, the field candidateCellinfoListMN contains information regarding cells that the MN suggests the candidate target secondary node to consider configuring for MN initiated CPA or CPC. \\
For (NG)EN-DC, including CSI-RS measurement results in candidateCelllnfoListMN is not supported in this version of the specification. For NR-DC, including SSB and/or CSIRS measurement results in candidate CellinfoListMN is supported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCellinfoListMN-EUTRA, candidateCellinfoListSN-EUTRA \\
Includes the MeasResultList3EUTRA as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. Contains information regarding cells that the master node or the source node suggests the target secondary eNB to consider configuring. These fields are only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCeIIListCPC \\
Contains information regarding cells that the source secondary node suggests the candidate target secondary node to consider configuring for SN initiated Conditional PSCell Change (CPC).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configRestrictinfo \\
Includes fields for which SgNB is explicitly indicated to observe a configuration restriction.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-ConfigMCG \\
This field contains the complete DRX configuration of the MCG. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-InfoMCG \\
This field contains the DRX Iong and short cycle configuration of the MCG. This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-InfoMCG2 \\
This field contains the drx-onDurationTimer configuration of the MCG. This field is only used in (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fr-infoListMCG \\
Contains information of FR information of serving cells that include PCell and SCell(s) configured in MCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dummy, dummy1 \\
These fields are not used in the specification and SN ignores the received value(s).
