\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UplinkConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierSwitching \\
Includes parameters for configuration of carrier based SRS switching (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableDefauitBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0, enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH, enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS \\
When the parameter is present, UE derives the spatial relation and the corresponding pathloss reference Rs as specified in 38.213, clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, 7.3.1 and 9.2.2. The network only configures these parameters for FR2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enablePL-RS-UpdateForPUSCH-SRS \\
When this parameter is present, the Rel-16 feature of MAC CE based pathloss RS updates for PUSCH/SRS is enabled. Network only configures this parameter when the UE is configured with sri-PUSCH-PowerControl. If this field is not configured, network configures at most 4 pathloss RS resources for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions per BWP, not including pathloss RS resources for SRS transmissions for positioning. (See TS 38.213 [13], clause 7).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id \\
If configured for an SpCell, this field contains the ID of the UL BWP to be activated upon performing the RRC (re-)configuration. If the field is absent, the RRC (re-)configuration does not impose a BWP switch. \\
If configured for an SCell, this field contains the ID of the uplink bandwidth part to be used upon activation of an SCell. The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BandiwdthPartld = 0.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
initialUplinkBWP \\
The dedicated (UE-specific) configuration for the initial uplink bandwidth-part (i.e. UL BWP\#0). If any of the optional IEs are configured within this IE as part of the IE uplinkConfig, the UE considers the BWP\#0 to be an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Otherwise, the UE does not consider the BWP\#0 as an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Network always configures the UE with a value for this field if no other BWPs are configured. NOTE1
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
moreThanOneNackOnlyMode-r17 \\
Indicates the mode of supporting more than one NACK-only feedback in the same PUCCH transmission. Mode 1 is UE multiplexing the HARQ-ACK bits by transforming NACK-only into ACK/NACK HARQ bits. Mode 2 is UE transmitting a specific sequence or a PUCCH transmission corresponding the combination more than one NACK-only HARQ feedback. If absent, UE uses the mode2 for mulicast CFR if configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpr-PowerBoost-FR2 \\
Indicates whether UE is allowed to boost uplink transmission power by suspending in-band emission (IBE) requirements as specified in TS 38.101-2 [39]. Network only configures this field for FR2 serving cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerBoostPi2BPSK \\
If this field is set to true, the UE determines the maximum output power for PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions that use pi/2 BPSK modulation according to TS 38.101-1 [15], clause 6.2.4.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pusch-ServingCellConfig \\
PUSCH related parameters that are not BWP-specific.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkBWP-ToAddModList \\
The additional bandwidth parts for uplink to be added or modified. In case of TDD uplink- and downlink BWP with the same bandwidthPart/d are considered as a BWP pair and must have the same center frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkBWP-ToReleaseList \\
The additional bandwidth parts for uplink to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uplinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List \\
A set of UE specific channel bandwidth and location configurations for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The UE uses the configuration provided in this field only for the purpose of channel bandwidth and location determination. If absent, UE uses the configuration indicated in scsSpecificCarrierList in UplinkConfigCommon / UplinkConfigCommonS/B. Network only configures channel bandwidth that corresponds to the channel bandwidth values defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].
