4- if results for the serving cell derived based on SSB are included:
\( 5> \) include the ssbFrequency to the value indicated by ssbFrequency as included in the MeasObjectNR of the serving cell;

4- if results for the serving cell derived based on CSI-RS are included:
5> include the refFreqCSI-RS to the value indicated by refFreqCSI-RS as included in the MeasObjectNR of the serving cell;

4> if the reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportQuantityRS-Indexes and maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport:
\( 5> \) for each serving cell configured with servingCellMO, include beam measurement information according to the associated reportConfig as described in 5.5.5.2, where availability is considered according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG;
\( 4> \) if reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportAddNeighMeas:
\( 5> \) if the measObjectNR indicated by the servingCellMO includes the RS resource configuration corresponding to the rsType indicated in the reportConfig:

6> set the measResultBestNeighCellListNR within measResultServFreqListNR-SCG to include one entry with the physCellld and the available measurement quantities based on the reportQuantityCell and rsType indicated in reportConfig of the non-serving cell corresponding to the concerned measObjectNR with the highest measured RSRP if RSRP measurement results are available for cells corresponding to this measObjectNR, otherwise with the highest measured RSRQ if RSRQ measurement results are available for cells corresponding to this measObjectNR, otherwise with the highest measured SINR, where availability is considered according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG;
\( 7> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportQuantityRS-Indexes and maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport:

8> for each best non-serving cell included in the measurement report:
9> include beam measurement information according to the associated reportConfig as described in 5.5.5.2, where availability is considered according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG;
\( 1> \) if the measRSSI-ReportConfig is configured within the corresponding reportConfig for this measId:
\( 2> \) set the rssi-Result to the linear average of sample value(s) provided by lower layers in the reportInterval;
\( 2> \) set the channelOccupancy to the rounded percentage of sample values which are beyond the channelOccupancyThreshold within all the sample values in the reportInterval;

1> if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via PC5-RRC connection (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) set the sl-MeasResultServingRelay to include the SL-RSRP of the serving L2 U2N Relay UE;
NOTE 1: In case of no data transmission from L2 U2N Relay UE to L2 U2N Remote UE, it is left to UE implementation whether to use SL-RSRP or SD-RSRP when setting the sl-MeasResultServingRelay of the serving L2 U2N Relay UE.
\( 1> \) if there is at least one applicable neighbouring cell to report:
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to eventTriggered or periodical:
\( 3> \) if the measurement report concerns the candidate L2 U2N Relay UE:
4> set the sl-MeasResultCandRelay to include the best candidate L2 U2N Relay UEs up to maxReportCells in accordance with the following:
\( 5> \) if the reportType is set to eventTriggered:
