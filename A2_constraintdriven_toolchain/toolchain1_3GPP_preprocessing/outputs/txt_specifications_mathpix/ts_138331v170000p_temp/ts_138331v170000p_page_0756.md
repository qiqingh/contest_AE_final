- \( \quad \) ReportConfigNR

The IE ReportConfigNR specifies criteria for triggering of an NR measurement reporting event or of a CHO, CPA or CPC event. For events labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and so on, measurement reporting events and CHO, CPA or CPC events are based on cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH block or CSIRS.

Event A1: Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A2: Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;
Event A3: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
Event A4: Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event A6: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell;
Event D1:Distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation l becomes larger than configured threshold1 Thresh l and distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation 2 becomes shorter than configured threshold Thresh 2;

CondEvent A3: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
CondEvent A4: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than absolute threshold;
CondEvent A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
CondEvent D1: Distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation l becomes larger than configured threshold Thresh l and distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation 2 of conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes shorter than configured threshold Thresh 2 ;

CondEvent T1: Time measured at UE becomes more than configured threshold Thresh l but is less than Thresh2;
Event X1: Seving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND NR Cell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event X2: Serving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold;
For event [1, measurement reporting event is based on CLI measurement results, which can either be derived based on SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI.
Event [1: Interference becomes higher than absolute threshold.
