\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedMaxinterFreqMeasidSCG \\
Used to request the maximum number of allowed measurement identities to configure for inter-frequency measurement. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedMaxintraFreqMeasidSCG \\
Used to request the maximum number of allowed measurement identities to configure for intra-frequency measurement on each serving frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedPDCCH-BlindDetectionSCG \\
Requested value of the reference number of cells for PDCCH blind detection allowed to be configured for the SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedP-MaxEUTRA \\
Requested value for the maximum power for the serving cells the UE can use in E-UTRA SCG. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedP-MaxFR1 \\
Requested value for the maximum power for the serving cells on frequency range 1 (FR1) in this secondary cell group (see TS 38.104 [12]) the UE can use in NR SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedP-MaxFR2 \\
Requested value for the maximum power for the serving cells on frequency range 2 (FR2) in this secondary cell group the UE can use in NR SCG. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requested Toffset \\
Requests the new value for the time offset restriction used by the SN for scheduling SCG transmissions (i.e. \( T_{p r o c, S C G}^{\text {max }} \), see TS 38.213 [13]). This field is used in NR-DC only when the fields nrdc-PC-mode-FR1-r16 or nrdc-PC-mode-FR2-r16 are set to dynamic. Value ms0dot5 corresponds to 0.5 ms , value ms0dot75 corresponds to 0.75 ms , value ms1 corresponds to 1 ms and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scellFrequenciesSN-EUTRA, scellFrequenciesSN-NR \\
Indicates the frequency of all SCells with SSB configured in SCG. The field scellFrequenciesSN-EUTRA is used in NE-DC; the field scellFrequenciesSN-NR is used in (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC. In (NG)EN-DC, the field is optionally provided to the MN. scellFrequenciesSN-NR indicates absoluteFrequencySSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg-CellGroupConfig \\
Contains the RRCReconfiguration message (containing only secondaryCellGroup and/or measConfig and/or otherConfig and/or conditionalReconfiguration and/or bap-Config and/or iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList): \\
- to be sent to the UE, used upon SCG establishment or modification (only when the SCG is not released by the SN), as generated (entirely) by the (target) SgNB. In this case, the SN sets the RRCReconfiguration message in accordance with clause 6 e.g. regarding the "Need" or "Cond" statements. \\
or \\
- including the current SCG configuration of the UE, when provided in response to a query from MN , or in SN triggered SN change in order to enable delta signaling by the target SN . In this case, the SN sets the \( R R C \) Reconfiguration message in accordance with clause 11.2.3. \\
The field is absent if neither SCG (re)configuration nor SCG configuration query nor SN triggered SN change is performed, e.g. at inter-node capability/configuration coordination which does not result in SCG (re)configuration towards the UE. The field is also absent upon an SCG release triggered by the SN. This field is not applicable in NE-DC.
