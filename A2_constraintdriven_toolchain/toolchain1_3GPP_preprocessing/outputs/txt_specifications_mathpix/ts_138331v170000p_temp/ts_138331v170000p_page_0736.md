\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PreamblePowerRampingStep \\
Power ramping steps for msgA PRACH. If the field is absent, UE shall use the value of powerRampingStep in RACH-ConfigGeneric in the configured BWP (see TS 38.321 [3], 5.1.3). This field may only be present if no 4-step type RA is configured in the BWP or in the case of separate ROs with 4-step type RA. The field is absent if RACHConfigGenericTwoStepRA is included in CFRA-TwoStep in RACH-ConfigDedicated and then the UE uses the value of msgA-PreamblePowerRampingStep in RACHConfigGenericTwoStepRA configured for CBRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower \\
The target power level at the network receiver side (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1.1 and TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). Only multiples of 2 dBm may be chosen (e.g -202, -200, \( -198, \ldots \) ). If the field is absent, UE shall use the value of preambleReceived TargetPower in RACH-ConfigGeneric in the configured BWP. This field may only be present if no 4step type RA is configured in the BWP. The field is absent if RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is included in CFRA-TwoStep in RACH-ConfigDedicated and then the UE uses the value of msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower in RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA configured for CBRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PRACH-Configurationindex \\
Cell-specific PRACH configuration index for 2-step RA type. If the field is absent the UE shall use the value of corresponding 4-step random access parameter in the configured BWP. If the value is in the range of 256 to 262, the field prach-Configuration/ndex-v1610 should be considered configured (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.2). This field may only be present if no 4 -step type RA is configured in the BWP or in the case of separate ROs with 4 -step type RA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FDM \\
The number of msgA PRACH transmission occasions Frequency-Division Multiplexed in one time instance. If the field is absent, UE shall use value of msg1-FDM in RACHConfigGeneric in the configured BWP (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.2). This field may only be present if no 4-step type RA is configured in the BWP or in the case of separate ROs with 4-step type RA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FrequencyStart \\
Offset of lowest PRACH transmissions occasion in frequency domain with respect to PRB 0 . If the field is absent, UE shall use value of msg 1-FrequencyStart in RACHConfigGeneric in the configured BWP (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 5.3.2 and 6.3.3.2). This field may only be present if no 4-step type RA is configured in the BWP or in the case of separate ROs with 4-step type RA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-ZeroCorrelationZoneConfig \\
N-CS configuration for msgA preamble, see Table 6.3.3.1-5 in TS 38.211 [16]. If the field is absent, UE shall use value zeroCorrelationZoneConfig in RACH-ConfigGeneric in the configured BWP. This field may only be present if no 4-step type RA is configured in the BWP or in the case of separate ROs with 4-step type RA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgB-ResponseWindow \\
MsgB monitoring window length in number of slots. The network configures a value lower than or equal to 40 ms (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The network does not configure msgB-ResponseWindow-r16 simultaneously with msgB-ResponseWindow-v1700, and if both fields are absent, the UE uses the value of msgB-ResponseWindow in RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA configured for CBRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preambleTransMax \\
Max number of RA preamble transmission performed before declaring a failure (see TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.5). If the field is absent, UE shall use the value of preamble TransMax in RACH-ConfigGeneric in the configured BWP. The field is absent if RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA is included in CFRA-TwoStep in RACHConfigDedicated and then the UE uses the value of preamble TransMax in RACH-ConfigGeneric TwoStepRA configured for CBRA.
