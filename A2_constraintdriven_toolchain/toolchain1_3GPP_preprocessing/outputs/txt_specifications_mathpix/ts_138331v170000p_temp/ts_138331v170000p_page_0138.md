\( 1> \) if the failure is detected due to reconfiguration with sync failure as described in 5.3.5.8.3, set the fields in VarRLF-report as follows:
\( 2> \) set the connectionFailureType to hof;
2 if any DAPS bearer was configured while T304 was running:
\( 3> \) set lastHO-Type to daps;
\( 3> \) if radio link failure was detected in the source PCell, according to clause \( 5.3 .10 .3: 4> \) set timeConnSourceDAPS-Failure to the time between the initiation of the DAPS handover execution and the radio link failure detected in the source PCell while T304 was running;
\( 4> \) set the \( n f \)-Cause to the trigger for detecting the source radio link failure in accordance with clause 5.3.10.4;
\( 2> \) set the nrFailedPCellld in failedPCellld to the global cell identity and tracking area code, if available, and otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the target PCell of the failed handover;
\( 2> \) include nrPreviousCell in previousPCellld and set it to the global cell identity and tracking area code of the PCell where the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was received;
\( 2> \) set the timeConnFailure to the elapsed time since reception of the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfiguration WithSync;
\( 1> \) else if the failure is detected due to Mobility from NR failure as described in 5.4.3.5, set the fields in VarRLFreport as follows:
\( 2> \) set the connectionFailureType to hof;
2> if last MobilityFromNRCommand concerned a failed inter-RAT handover from NR to E-UTRA and if the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA (NR to EUTRA):
\( 3> \) set the eutraFailedPCellld in failedPCellld to the global cell identity and tracking area code, if available, and otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the target PCell of the failed handover;
\( 2> \) include nrPreviousCell in previousPCellld and set it to the global cell identity and tracking area code of the PCell where the last MobilityFromNRCommand message was received;
\( 2> \) if configuration of the conditional handover is available in VarConditionalReconfig at the moment of the handover failure:
\( 3> \) set timeSinceCHO-Reconfig to the time elapsed between the execution of the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync for the target PCell of the failed conditional handover, and the reception in the source PCell of the last conditionalReconfiguration including the condRRCReconfig of the target PCell of the failed conditional handover;
\( 3> \) set choCandidateCellList to include the global cell identity and tracking area code, if available, and otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of each of the candidate target cells for conditional handover included in condRRCReconfig within VarConditionalReconfig at the time of the failed conditional handover, excluding the candidate target cells included in measResu/NeighCells;
\( 2> \) set the timeConnFailure to the elapsed time since the initialization of the handover associated to the last MobilityFromNRCommand message;
\( 1> \) else if the failure is detected due to radio link failure as described in 5.3 .10 .3 , set the fields in VarRLF-report as follows:
\( 2> \) set the connectionFailureType to rlf;
\( 2> \) set the \( r l f \)-Cause to the trigger for detecting radio link failure in accordance with clause 5.3 .10 .4 ;
2> set the nrFailedPCellld in failedPCellld to the global cell identity and the tracking area code, if available, and otherwise to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the PCell where radio link failure is detected;
