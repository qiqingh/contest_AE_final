\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-ConfiguredGrantConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-ConfigindexCG \\
This field indicates the ID to identify configured grant for sidelink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-CG-MaxTransNumList \\
This field indicates the maximum number of times that a TB can be transmitted using the resources provided by the configured grant. si-Priority corresponds to the logical channel priority.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-FreqResourceCG-Type1 \\
Indicates the frequency resource location of sidelink configured grant type 1. An index giving valid combinations of one or two starting sub-channel and length (jointly encoded) as resource indicator (RIV), as defined in TS 38.214 [19].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-HARQ-ProcID-Offset \\
Indicates the offset used in deriving the HARQ process IDs for SL configured grant type 1 or SL configured type 2, see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-N1PUCCH-AN \\
This field indicates the HARQ resource for PUCCH for sidelink configured grant type 1. The actual PUCCH-Resource is configured in si-PUCCH-Config and referred to by its ID.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-N1PUCCH-AN-Type 2 \\
This field indicates the HARQ resource for PUCCH for PSCCH/PSSCH transmissions without a corresponding PDCCH on sidelink configured grant type 2. The actual PUCCHResource is configured in sl-PUCCH-Config and referred to by its ID.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes \\
This field indicates the number of HARQ processes configured for a specific configured grant. It applies for both Type 1 and Type 2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PeriodCG \\
This field indicates the period of sidelink configured grant in the unit of ms.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1 \\
This field, for configured grant type 1, indicates slot offset between the PSFCH associated with the last PSSCH resource of each period and the PUCCH occasion used for reporting sidelink HARQ.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-ResourcePoollD \\
Indicates the resource pool in which the configured sidelink grant Type 1 is applied.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-StartSubchannelCG-Type1 \\
This field indicates the starting sub-channel of sidelink configured grant Type 1. An index giving valid sub-channel index.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-TimeOffsetCG-Type1 \\
This field indicates the slot offset with respect to logical slot defined by si-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-TimeReferenceSFN-Type 1 \\
Indicates SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource in time domain. If it is present, the UE uses the \( 1^{\text {st }} \) logical slot of associated resource pool after the starting time of the closest SFN with the indicated number preceding the reception of the sidelink configured grant configuration Type 1 as reference logical slot, see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.3. If it is not present, the reference SFN is 0 .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TimeResourceCG-Type1 \\
This field indicates the time resource location of sidelink configured grant Type 1. An index giving valid combinations of up to two slot positions (jointly encoded) as time resource indicator (TRIV), as defined in TS 38.212 [17].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
