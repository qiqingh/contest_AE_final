description table should indicate that the UE considers the original list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the following example:
```
-- /example 1/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE \
```

```
    ...;
    [ [
    -- Non-critical extension lists
```

```
    ]]
}
-- ASN1STOP
```

- When fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix "Ext" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name (before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the new structures, also with the "Ext" suffix. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should typically be ensured that the contained fields in the "Ext" elements are releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish the lists (e.g. listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz added after listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy). The result is as shown in the following example:
```
-- /example 2/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
```

```
    ...,
    [ [
    -- Parallel list
```

```
    ]],
    [ [
    -- Second parallel list from a later spec version
```

```
    ]]
}
ListElement ::= SEQUENCE \
    elementId ListElementId,
    fieldl INTEGER (0..3),
    field2 ENUMERATED { valuel, value2, value3 }
}
```
