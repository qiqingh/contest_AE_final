\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide the UE preference for SCG deactivation;
\( 1> \) if the SCG is deactivated, and,
\( 1> \) the UE has uplink data to send for an SCG RLC entity while the UE previously did not have any uplink data to send for any SCG RLC entity:
\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to indicate that the UE has uplink data to send for a DRB whose DRB-Identity is not included in any RLC-BearerConfig in the CellGroupConfig associated with the MCG.
\( 1> \) if configured to send indications of RRM measurement relaxation criterion fulfilment:
\( 2> \) if the criterion in 5.7.4.4 is met for a period of \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {SearchDelaP-StabonaryConnected: }} \)
\( 3> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistancelnformation message with rrm-MeasRelaxationFulfilment as true since it was configured to provide indications of RRM measurement relaxation criterion fulfilment; or
\( 3> \) the last UEAssistancelnformation message indicated the criterion in 5.7.4.4 is not fulfilled with rrmMeasRelaxationFulfilment as false:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to indicate that the criterion for RRM measurement relaxation for connected mode is fulfilled;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if the last UEAssistancelnformation message indicated fulfilment of the criterion in 5.7 .4 .4 with rmm MeasRelaxationFulfilment as true:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to indicate that the criterion for RRM measurement relaxation for connected mode is not fulfilled.
5.7.4.3 Actions related to transmission of UEAssistanceInformation message

The UE shall set the contents of the UEAssistancelnformation message as follows:
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide a delay budget report according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3;
\( 2> \) set delayBudgetReport to typel according to a desired value;
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide overheating assistance information according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3;
\( 2> \) if the UE experiences internal overheating:
\( 3> \) if the UE prefers to temporarily reduce the number of maximum secondary component carriers:
\( 4> \) include reducedMaxCCs in the OverheatingAssistance [E;
\( 4> \) set reducedCCsDL to the number of maximum SCells the UE prefers to be temporarily configured in downlink;
\( 4> \) set reducedCCsUL to the number of maximum SCells the UE prefers to be temporarily configured in uplink;
\( 3> \) if the UE prefers to temporarily reduce maximum aggregated band width of FR1:
\( 4> \) include reducedMaxBW-FRI in the OverheatingAssistance [E;
\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W-D L \) to the maximum aggregated band width the UE prefers to be temporarily configured across all downlink carriers of FR1;
