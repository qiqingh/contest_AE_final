3> if otherConfig includes minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceConfigExt:
4> consider itself to be configured to provide its preference on the minimum scheduling offset for 480 kHz SCS and/or 960 kHz SCS for cross-slot scheduling for power saving for the cell group in accordance with 5.7.4;
\( 2> \) else:
3> consider itself not to be configured to provide its preference on the minimum scheduling offset for crossslot scheduling for power saving for the cell group and stop timer T346e associated with the cell group, if running;
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the releasePreferenceConfig:
\( 2> \) if releasePreferenceConfig is set to setup:
3> consider itself to be configured to provide assistance information to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED in accordance with 5.7.4;
\( 2> \) else:
3> consider itself not to be configured to provide assistance information to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED and stop timer T346f, if running.
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the obtainCommonLocation:
\( 2> \) include available detailed location information for any subsequent measurement report or any subsequent RLF report and SCGFailureInformation;

NOTE 1: The UE is requested to attempt to have valid detailed location information available whenever sending a measurement report for which it is configured to include available detailed location information. The UE may not succeed e.g. because the user manually disabled the GPS hardware, due to no/poor satellite coverage. Further details, e.g. regarding when to activate GNSS, are up to UE implementation.
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the btNameList:
\( 2> \) if btNameList is set to setup, include available Bluetooth measurement results for any subsequent measurement report or any subsequent RLF report and SCGFailureInformation;
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the wlanNameList:
\( 2> \) if wlanNameList is set to setup, include available WLAN measurement results for any subsequent measurement report or any subsequent RLF report and SCGFailureInformation;
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the sensorNameList:
\( 2> \) if sensorNameList is set to setup, include available Sensor measurement results for any subsequent measurement report or any subsequent RLF report and SCGFailureInformation;

NOTE 2: The UE is requested to attempt to have valid Bluetooth measurements, WLAN measurements and Sensor measurements whenever sending a measurement report for which it is configured to include these measurements. The UE may not succeed e.g. because the user manually disabled the WLAN or Bluetooth or Sensor hardware. Further details, e.g. regarding when to activate WLAN or Bluetooth or Sensor, are up to UE implementation.
\( 1> \) if the received otherConfig includes the \( s \)-AssistanceConfigNR:
\( 2> \) consider itself to be configured to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication in accordance with 5.7.4;

1> if the received otherConfig includes the referenceTimePreferenceReporting:
\( 2> \) consider itself to be configured to provide UE reference time assistance information in accordance with 5.7.4;
1> else:
\( 2> \) consider itself not to be configured to provide UE reference time assistance information;
