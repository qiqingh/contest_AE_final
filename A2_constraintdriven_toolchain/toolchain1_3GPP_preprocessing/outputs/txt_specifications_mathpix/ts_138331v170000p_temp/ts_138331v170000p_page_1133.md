\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
selectedBandEntriesM/NList \\
A list of indices referring to the position of a band entry selected by the MN, in each band combination entry in allowedBC-ListMRDC IE. BandEntrylndex 0 identifies the first band in the bandList of the BandCombination, BandEntrylndex 1 identifies the second band in the bandList of the BandCombination, and so on. This selectedBandEntriesMNList includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order as in allowedBC-ListMRDC. The SN uses this information to determine which bands out of the NR band combinations in allowedBC-ListMRDC it can configure in SCG in NR-DC. The SN can use this information to determine for which band pair(s) it should check SimultaneousRxTxPerBandPair.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servCellindexRangeSCG \\
Range of serving cell indices that SN is allowed to configure for SCG serving cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servCellinfoListMCG-EUTRA \\
Indicates the carrier frequency and the transmission bandwidth of the serving cell(s) in the MCG in intra-band (NG)EN-DC. The field is needed when MN and SN operate serving cells in the same band for either contiguous or non-contiguous intra-band band combination or LTE NR inter-band band combinations where the frequency range of the E-UTRA band is a subset of the frequency range of the NR band (as specified in Table 5.5B.4.1-1 of TS 38.101-3 [34]) in (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servCellinfoListMCG-NR \\
Indicates the frequency band indicator, carrier center frequency, UE specific channel bandwidth and SCS of the serving cell(s) in the MCG in intra-band NE-DC. The field is needed when MN and SN operate serving cells in the same band for either contiguous or non-contiguous intra-band band combination or LTE NR inter-band band combinations where the frequency range of the E-UTRA band is a subset of the frequency range of the NR band (as specified in Table 5.5B.4.1-1 of TS 38.101-3 [34]) in NEDC .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servFrequenciesMN-NR \\
Indicates the frequency of all serving cells that include PCell and SCell(s) with SSB configured in MCG. This field is only used in NR-DC. servFrequenciesMN-NR indicates absoluteFrequencySSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sftdFrequencyList-NR \\
Includes a list of SSB frequencies. Each entry identifies the SSB frequency of a PSCell, which corresponds to one MeasResultCellSFTD-NR entry in the \\
MeasResultCellListSFTD-NR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sftdFrequencyList-EUTRA \\
Includes a list of E-UTRA frequencies. Each entry identifies the carrier frequency of a PSCell, which corresponds to one MeasResultSFTD-EUTRA entry in the MeasResultCellListSFTD-EUTRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sidelinkUEinformationEUTRA \\
This field contains the E-UTRA SidelinkUE/nformation message as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sidelinkUEInformationNR \\
This field contains the NR SidelinkUE/nformationNR message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceConfigSCG \\
Includes all of the current SCG configurations used by the target SN to build delta configuration to be sent to UE, e.g. during SN change. The field contains the RRCReconfiguration message, i.e. including secondaryCellGroup and measConfig. The field is signalled upon change of SN, unless MN uses full configuration option. \\
Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceConfigSCG-EUTRA \\
Includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRC message can only include the field scg-Configuration. In this version of the specification, this field is absent when master gNB uses full configuration option. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ueAssistanceinformationSourceSCG \\
Includes for each UE assistance feature associated with the SCG, the information last reported by the UE in the NR UEAssistancelnformation message for the source SCG, if any.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ue-Capabilityinfo \\
Contains the IE UE-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList supported by the UE (see NOTE 3). A gNB that retrieves MRDC related capability containers ensures that the set of included MRDC containers is consistent w.r.t. the feature set related information.
\end{tabular} \\
