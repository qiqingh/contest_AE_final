\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PDCCH-ConfigCommon field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
commonControlResourceSet \\
An additional common control resource set which may be configured and used for any common or UE-specific search space. If the network configures this field, it uses a ControlResourceSetld other than 0 for this ControlResourceSet. The network configures the commonControlResourceSet in SIB1 so that it is contained in the bandwidth of CORESET\#0.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
commonSearchSpaceList, commonSearchSpaceListExt \\
A list of additional common search spaces. If the network configures this field, it uses the SearchSpacelds other than 0. If the field is included, it replaces any previous list, i.e. all the entries of the list are replaced and each of the SearchSpace entries is considered to be newly created and the conditions and Need codes for setup of the entry apply. If the network includes commonSearchSpaceListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in commonSearchSpaceList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
controlResourceSetZero \\
Parameters of the common CORESET\#0 which can be used in any common or UE-specific search spaces. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in M/B pdcch-ConfigS/B1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP\#0) controlResourceSetZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10 are satisfied.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO \\
Indicates the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of each PO of the PF on this BWP, see TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pagingSearchSpace \\
ID of the Search space for paging (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive paging in this BWP (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-SearchSpace \\
ID of the Search space for random access procedure (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive RAR in this BWP. This field is mandatory present in the DL BWP(s) if the conditions described in TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15 are met.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-SearchSpace \\
Common search space for CG-SDT and RA-SDT (see TS 38.213 [13]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceMCCH \\
ID of the search space for MCCH. If the field is absent, the UE does not receive MCCH in this BWP (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceMTCH \\
ID of the search space for MTCH of MBS broadcast. If the field is absent, the UE applies searchSpaceMCCH also for MTCH, (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceOtherSysteminformation \\
ID of the Search space for other system information, i.e., SIB2 and beyond (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1) If the field is absent, the UE does not receive other system information in this BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceSIB1 \\
ID of the search space for SIB1 message. In the initial DL BWP of the UE's PC ell, the network sets this field to 0 . If the field is absent, the UE does not receive SIB1 in this BWP. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceZero \\
Parameters of the common SearchSpace\#0. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in MIB pdcch-ConfigS/B1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP\#0), searchSpaceZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10, are satisfied.
