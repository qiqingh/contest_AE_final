\( 3> \) configure the RLF timers and constants for this cell group as specified in 5.3.5.5.6;
\( 2> \) else if \( n f \)-TimersAndConstants is not configured for this cell group:
\( 3> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured:
4> use values for timers T301, T310, T311 and constants N310, N311 for the target cell group, as included in ue-TimersAndConstants received in SIB1;

3> else
4> use values for timers T301, T310, T311 and constants N310, N311, as included in ueTimersAndConstants received in SIB1;
\( 2> \) if the SpCellConfig contains spCellConfigDedicated:
\( 3> \) configure the SpCell in accordance with the spCellConfigDedicated;
\( 3> \) consider the bandwidth part indicated in firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id if configured to be the active uplink bandwidth part;
\( 3> \) consider the bandwidth part indicated in firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id if configured to be the active downlink bandwidth part or the bandwidth part for Radio Link Monitoring, Beam Failure Detection and measurements if the SpCellConfig is included in an RRCReconfiguration message contained in an NR or E-UTRA RRC message indicating that the SCG is deactivated;

3> if any of the reference signal(s) that are used for radio link monitoring are reconfigured by the received spCellConfigDedicated:

4> stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
4> stop timer T312 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
4> reset the counters N310 and N311.
\( 1> \) if the SpCellConfig contains the lowMobilityEvaluationConnected:
\( 2> \) the UE may perform the evaluation of the low mobility criterion for this cell group as specified in 5.7.13.1;
\( 1> \) if the SpCellConfig contains the goodServingCellEvaluationRLM:
\( 2> \) the UE may perform the evaluation of the good serving cell quality criterion for this cell group as specified in 5.7.13.2;
\( 1> \) if the SpCellConfig contains the goodServingCellEvaluationBFD:
\( 2> \) the UE may perform the evaluation of the good serving cell quality criterion for this serving cell as specified in 5.7.13.2;
5.3.5.5.8 SCell Release

The UE shall:
1> if the release is triggered by reception of the sCellToReleaseList:
⊗ for each sCellIndex value included in the sCellToReleaseList:
\( 3> \) if the current UE configuration includes an SCell with value sCellIndex:
4> release the SCell.
