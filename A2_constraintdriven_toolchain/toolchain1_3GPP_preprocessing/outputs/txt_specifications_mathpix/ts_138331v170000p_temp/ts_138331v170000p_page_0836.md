\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-IndexSevingcell \\
Indicates SSB index belonging to a serving cell
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-NCell \\
This field indicates a SSB configuration from neighboring cell
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
usage \\
Indicates if the SRS resource set is used for beam management, codebook based or non-codebook based transmission or antenna switching. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1. Reconfiguration between codebook based and non-codebook based transmission is not supported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
usagePDC \\
If configured, it indicates that this SRS resource set is used for propagation delay compensation. The field can be present in only one SRS-ResourceSet. If this field is present, the UE ignore the field usage.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SSB-InfoNCell field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
physicalCellld \\
This field specifies the physical cell ID of the neighbour cell for which SSB configuration is provided.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-IndexNcell \\
This field specifies the index of the SSB for a neighbour cell. See TS 38.213 [13]. If this field is absent, the UE determines the ssb-IndexNcell of the physicalCellid based on its SSB measurement from the cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-Configuration \\
This field specifies the full configuration of the SSB. If this field is absent, the UE obtains the configuration for the SSB from \( n \)-SSB-Config received as part of DL-PRS assistance data in LPP, see TS 37.355 [49], by looking up the corresponding SSB configuration using the field physicalCelll.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline DL-PRS-Info field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
di-PRS-ID \\
This field specifies the UE specific TRP ID (see TS 37.355 [49]) for which PRS configuration is provided.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dI-PRS-ResourceSetid \\
This field specifies the PRS-ResourceSet ID of a PRS resourceSet.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dl-PRS-Resourceld \\
This field specifies the PRS-Resource ID of a PRS resource. If this field is absent, the UE determines the dl-PRS-Resource/D based on its PRS measurement from the TRP (see TS 37.355 [49]) and DL-PRS Resource Set.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SSB-Configuration field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
halfFrameindex \\
Indicates whether SSB is in the first half or the second half of the frame. Value zero indicates the first half and value 1 indicates the second half.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
integerSubframeOffset \\
Indicates the subframe boundary offset of the cell in which SSB is transmited.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sfn0-Offset \\
Indiactes the time offset of the SFN0 slot 0 for the cell with respect to SFN0 slot 0 of serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
