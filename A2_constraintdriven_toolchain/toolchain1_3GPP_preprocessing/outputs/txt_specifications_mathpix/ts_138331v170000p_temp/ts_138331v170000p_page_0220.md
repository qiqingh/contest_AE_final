5.7.2 UL information transfer
5.7.2.1 General

Figure 5.7.2.1-1: UL information transfer

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS dedicated information from the UE to the network, or to transfer F1-C related information from IAB-DU to IAB Donor-CU via IAB-MT in RRC CONNECTED.
5.7.2.2 Initiation

AUE in RRC_CONNECTED or a UE in RRC_INACTIVE during SDT initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer NAS dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL information transfer procedure by sending the ULInformation Transfer message. In addition, an [AB-MT in RRC CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer F1-C related information. When F1-C related information has to be transferred, the IAB-MT shall initiate the procedure only if SBR2 or split SRB2 is established.
5.7.2.3 Actions related to transmission of ULInformationTransfer message

The UE shall set the contents of the ULInformationTransfer message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the upper layer provides NAS PDU:
\( 2> \) set the dedicatedNAS-Message to include the information received from upper layers;
\( 1> \) for the IAB-MT, if there is a need to transfer F1-C related information:
\( 2> \) include the dedicatedInfoF1c;
1> submit the ULInformationTransfer message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.7.2.4 Failure to deliver ULInformationTransfer message

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if AS security is not started and radio link failure occurs before the successful delivery of ULInformationTransfer messages has been confirmed by lower layers; or
\( 1> \) if PDCP re-establishment or release/addition (e.g due to key refresh upon PCell or PSCell change, or RRC connection re-establishment, or failure of resume procedure initiated for SDT) occurs on an SRB on which ULInformationTransfer messages were submitted for transmission but successful delivery of these messages was not confirmed by lower layers:
\( 2> \) inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information contained in the concerned ULInformationTransfer messages, unless the messages only include dedicatedInfoFlc.
