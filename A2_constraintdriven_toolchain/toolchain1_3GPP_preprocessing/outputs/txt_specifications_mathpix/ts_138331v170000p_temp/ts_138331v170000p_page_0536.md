\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CSI-ReportConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrier \\
Indicates in which serving cell the CS/-ResourceConfig indicated below are to be found. If the field is absent, the resources are on the same serving cell as this report configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
codebookConfig \\
Codebook configuration for Type-1 or Type-2 including codebook subset restriction. Network can only configure one of codebookConfig, codebookConfig-r16 or codebookConfig-r17 to a UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cqi-BitsPerSubband \\
This field can only be present if cqi-Formatindicator is set to subbandCQI. If the field is configured with bits4, the UE uses 4-bit sub-band CQI. If the field is not present and cqiFormatindicator is set to subbandCQI, the UE uses 2-bit sub-band differential CQI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cqi-Formatindicator \\
Indicates whether the UE shall report a single (wideband) or multiple (subband) CQI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cqi-Table \\
Which CQI table to use for CQI calculation (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.1). For a RedCap UE, CQI table 2 is only supported if the UE indicates support of 256QAM for PUSCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-IM-ResourcesForinterference \\
CSI IM resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfigid of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only CSI-IM resources. The bwp-Id in that CSI-ResourceConfig is the same value as the bwp-Id in the CSI- \\
ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-ReportingBand \\
Indicates a contiguous or non-contiguous subset of subbands in the bandwidth part which CSI shall be reported for. Each bit in the bit-string represents one subband. The right-most bit in the bit string represents the lowest subband in the BWP. The choice determines the number of subbands (subbands3 for 3 subbands, subbands4 for 4 subbands, and so on) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). This field is absent if there are less than 24 PRBs (no sub band) and present otherwise (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-ReportMode \\
Configures the CSI report modes Mode1 or Mode 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dummy \\
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
groupBasedBeamReporting \\
Turning on/off group beam based reporting (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
non-PMI-Portindication \\
Port indication for RI/CQI calculation. For each CSI-RS resource in the linked ResourceConfig for channel measurement, a port indication for each rank R, indicating which R ports to use. Applicable only for non-PMI feedback (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2). \\
The first entry in non-PM/-Portindication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the CSI-ResourceConfig whose CSI-ResourceConfigld is indicated in a CSI-MeasId together with the above CSIReportConfig/d; the second entry in non-PMI-PortIndication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig, and so on until the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the last entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig. Then the next entry corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the second entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfPMI-SubbandsPerCQI-Subband \\
Field indicates how PMI subbands are defined per CQI subband, as defined in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.2.7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofReportedGroups \\
Presence if this field indicates that groupBasedBeamReportingR17 is enabled and the value configures the number of reported beam groups per CSI-report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
