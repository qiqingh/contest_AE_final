\( 3> \) use the resource pool(s) indicated by \( s l \)-RxPool for NR sidelink communication reception, as specified in 5.8.7;
\( 2> \) if configured to transmit NR sidelink communication:
\( 3> \) use the resource pool(s) indicated by \( s i \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal, sl-TxPoolSelectedNormalPS, slTxPoolScheduling or sl-TxPoolExceptional for NR sidelink communication transmission, as specified in 5.8.8;
\( 2> \) if configured to receive NR sidelink discovery:
\( 3> \) use the resource pool(s) indicated by \( s l \)-DiscRxPool or \( s l \)-RxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception, as specified in 5.8.13.2;

2 if configured to transmit NR sidelink discovery:
3> use the resource pool(s) indicated by sl-DiscTxPoolSelected, sl-DiscTxPoolScheduling, slTxPoolSelectedNormal, sl-TxPoolScheduling or sl-TxPoolExceptional for NR sidelink discovery transmission, as specified in 5.8.13.3;
\( 2> \) perform CBR measurement on the transmission resource pool(s) indicated by sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal, slTxPoolSelectedNormalPS, sl-TxPoolScheduling, sl-DiscTxPoolSelected, sl-DiscTxPoolScheduling or slTxPoolExceptional for NR sidelink communication transmission, as specified in 5.5.3;
\( 2> \) use the synchronization configuration parameters for NR sidelink communication on frequencies included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList, as specified in 5.8.5;
\( 1> \) if sl-RadioBearerToReleaseList or sl-RLC-BearerToReleaseList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) perform sidelink DRB release as specified in 5.8.9.1a.1;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-RadioBearerToAddModList or sl-RLC-BearerToAddModList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) perform sidelink DRB addition/modification as specified in 5.8.9.1a.2;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-ScheduledConfig is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) configure the MAC entity parameters, which are to be used for NR sidelink communication, in accordance with the received \( s l \)-ScheduledConfig;
\( 1> \) if \( s \)-UE-SelectedConfig is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) configure the parameters, which are to be used for NR sidelink communication, in accordance with the received \( s \)-UE-SelectedConfig;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-MeasConfigInfoToReleaseList is included in \( s \) l-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) for each SL-DestinationIndex included in the received sl-MeasConfigInfoToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration:
\( 3> \) remove the entry with the matching SL-DestinationIndex from the stored NR sidelink measurement configuration information;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-MeasConfigInfoToAddModList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) for each sl-DestinationIndex included in the received sl-MeasConfigInfoToAddModList that is part of the current stored NR sidelink measurement configuration:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the entry according to the value received for this \( s l \)-DestinationIndex from the stored NR sidelink measurement configuration information;
\( 2> \) for each \( s \) /-DestinationIndex included in the received \( s \) /-MeasConfigInfoToAddModList that is not part of the current stored NR sidelink measurement configuration:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for this \( s l \)-DestinationIndex to the stored NR sidelink measurement configuration.
