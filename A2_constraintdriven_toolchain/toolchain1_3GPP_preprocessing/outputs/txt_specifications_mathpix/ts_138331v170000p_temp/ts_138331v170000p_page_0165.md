5.5.2 Measurement configuration
5.5.2.1 General

The network applies the procedure as follows:
- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a measConfig associated with a CG, it includes a measObject for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of the CG to be measured;
- to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportCGI;
- to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP entity using a reporting configuration with the ul-DelayValueConfig;
- to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP entity using a reporting configuration with the ul-Excess Delay Config;
- to ensure that, in the measConfig associated with a CG:
- for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with the same ssbFrequency;
- an smtcl included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an \( s m t c 2 \) included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc3list included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc4list included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value;
- to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and in TS 36.331 [10] with the same ssbFrequency have the same ssbSubcarrierSpacing;
- to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object associated with the SCG:
- for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtcl configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according to the smtcl configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
- to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
- for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the smtcl configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
- when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportSFTD;

For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:
- to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object have the same center frequency, (startPRB+floor(nrofPRBs/2))
- to ensure that the total number of CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object does not exceed the maximum number specified in TS 38.214 [19].

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the received measConfig includes the measObjectToRemoveList:
\( 2> \) perform the measurement object removal procedure as specified in 5.5.2.4;
