\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline ServingCellConfigCommon field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelAccessMode \\
If present, this field indicates which channel access procedures to apply for operation with shared spectrum channel access as defined in TS 37.213[48]. If the field is configured as "semiStatic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures for semi-static channel occupancy as described in clause 4.3 in TS 37.213. If the field is configured as "dynamic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures in TS 37.213, with the exception of clause 4.3 of TS 37.213.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelAccessMode2 \\
If present ('enabled'), the UE shall apply channel access mode procedures for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4 for FR2-2. If absent, the UE shall not apply any channel access procedure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dmrs-TypeA-Position \\
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.1) and uplink (TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkConfigCommon \\
The common downlink configuration of the serving cell, including the frequency information configuration and the initial downlink BWP common configuration. The parameters provided herein should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) of the serving cell, with the exception of controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero which can be configured in ServingCellConfigCommon even if MIB indicates that they are absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
discoveryBurstWindowLength \\
Indicates the window length of the discovery burst in ms (see TS 37.213 [48]). The field discoveryBurstWindowLength-r17 is applicable to SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
longBitmap \\
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 64 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ite-CRS-ToMatchAround \\
Parameters to determine an LTE CRS pattern that the UE shall rate match around.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mediumBitmap \\
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
\( n \)-TimingAdvanceOffset \\
The N_TA-Offset to be applied for all uplink transmissions on this serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value defined for the duplex mode and frequency range of this serving cell. See TS 38.133 [14], table 7.1.2-2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rateMatchPatternToAddModList \\
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the rate match patterns. Rate match patterns defined here on cell level apply only to PDSCH of the same numerology (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4,1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
shortBitmap \\
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 4 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ss-PBCH-BlockPower \\
Average EPRE of the resources elements that carry secondary synchronization signals in dBm that the NW used for SSB transmission, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-periodicityServingCell \\
The SSB periodicity in ms for the rate matching purpose. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value ms5. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-PositionQCL \\
Indicates the QCL relation between SSB positions for this serving cell as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
