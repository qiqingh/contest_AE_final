intraFreq-needForGap \\

servCellid \\
Indicates the serving cell which contains the target SSB (associated with the initial DL BWP) to be measured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapindicationintra \\
Indicates whether measurement gap is required for the UE to perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements on the concerned serving cell. Value gap indicates that a measurement gap is needed if any of the UE configured BWPs do not contain the frequency domain resources of the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Value no-gap indicates a measurement gap is not needed to measure the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP for all configured BWPs, no matter the SSB is within the configured BWP or not.

\hline NeedForGapsNR field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bandNR \\
Indicates the NR target band to be measured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapindication \\
Indicates whether measurement gap is required for the UE to perform SSB based measurements on the concerned NR target band while NR-DC or NE-DC is not configured. The UE determines this information based on the resultant configuration of the RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume message that triggers this response. Value gap indicates that a measurement gap is needed, value no-gap indicates a measurement gap is not needed.
