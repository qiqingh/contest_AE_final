\( F_{n} \) is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
\( F_{n-1} \) is the old filtered measurement result, where \( F_{\theta} \) is set to \( M_{1} \) when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and for MeasObjectNR, \( a=1 / 2^{(k i / 4)} \), where \( k_{i} \) is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity of the \( i \) : th QuantityConfigNR in quantityConfigNR-List, and \( i \) is indicated by quantityConfigIndex in MeasObjectNR; for other measurements, \( \boldsymbol{a}=1 / 2^{(k / 4)} \), where \( \boldsymbol{k} \) is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the quantityConfig; for UTRA-FDD, \( \mathrm{a}=1 / 2^{(\mathrm{k} / 4)} \), where k is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by quantityConfigUTRA-FDD in the QuantityConfig;
\( 2> \) adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficient \( k \) assumes a sample rate equal to \( \mathrm{X} m s \); The value of X is equivalent to one intrafrequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133 [14] assuming non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.

NOTE 1: If \( \boldsymbol{k} \) is set to 0 , no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.

NOTE 3: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].

NOTE 4: For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to reset filtering upon BWP switch.
5.5.3.3 Derivation of cell measurement results

The network may configure the UE in RRC_CONNECTED to derive RSRP, RSRQ and SINR measurement results per cell associated to NR measurement objects based on parameters configured in the measObject (e.g. maximum number of beams to be averaged and beam consolidation thresholds) and in the reportConfig (rsType to be measured, SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).

The network may configure the UE in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE to derive RSRP and RSRQ measurement results per cell associated to NR carriers based on parameters configured in measldleCarrierListNR within VarMeasIdleConfig for measurements performed according to 5.7.8.2a

The UE shall:
1> for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on SS/PBCH block:
\( 2> \) if nrofSS-BlocksToAverage is not configured in the associated measObject in RRC_CONNECTED or in the associated entry in measIdleCarrierListNR within VarMeasIdleConfig in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE; or
\( 2> \) if absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation is not configured in the associated measObject in RRC_CONNECTED or in the associated entry in measIdleCarrierListNR within VarMeasIdleConfig in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE; or
\( 2> \) if the highest beam measurement quantity value is below or equal to absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation:
\( 3> \) derive each cell measurement quantity based on SS/PBCH block as the highest beam measurement quantity value, where each beam measurement quantity is described in TS 38.215 [9];
\( 2> \) else:
3> derive each cell measurement quantity based on SS/PBCH block as the linear power scale average of the highest beam measurement quantity values above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation where the total number of averaged beams shall not exceed nrofSS-BlocksToAverage, and where each beam measurement quantity is described in TS 38.215 [9];
\( 2> \) if in RRC_CONNECTED, apply layer 3 cell filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;
1> for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on CSI-RS:
