5.7.8.2 Void
5.7.8.2a Performing measurements

When performing measurements on NR carriers according to this clause, the UE shall derive the cell quality as specified in 5.5.3.3 and consider the beam quality to be the value of the measurement results of the concerned beam, where each result is averaged as described in TS 38.215 [9].

While in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, and T331 is running and and T319a is not running, the UE shall:
1> perform the measurements in accordance with the following:
\( 2> \) if the VarMeasIdleConfig includes the measIdleCarrierListEUTRA and the SIBI contains idleModeMeasurements EUTRA:
\( 3> \) for each entry in measIdleCarrierListEUTRA within VarMeasIdleConfig:
4> if UE supports NE-DC between the serving carrier and the carrier frequency indicated by carrierFreqEUTRA within the corresponding entry:
\( 5> \) perform measurements in the carrier frequency and bandwidth indicated by carrierFreqEUTRA and allowedMeasBandwidth within the corresponding entry;
\( 5> \) if the reportQuantitiesEUTRA is set to rsrq:
\( 6> \) consider RSRQ as the sorting quantity;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) consider RSRP as the sorting quantity;
