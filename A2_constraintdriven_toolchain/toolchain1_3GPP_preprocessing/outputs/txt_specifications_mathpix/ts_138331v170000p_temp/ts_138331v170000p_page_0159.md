\( 2> \) the procedure ends;
Upon L2 U2N Relay UE receives RRCReject, it either triggers PC5-S release or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 5.8.9.10.

The RRC_INACTIVE UE shall continue to monitor paging while the timer T302 is running.
NOTE: If timer T331 is running, the UE continues to perform idle/inactive measurements according to 5.7.8.
5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1 Introduction

Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA, where E-UTRA can be connected to either EPC or 5GC, and from NR to UTRA-FDD is supported.
5.4.2 Handover to NR
5.4.2.1 General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful

The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. E-UTRAN) to NR.

The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
5.4.2.2 Initiation

The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending the RRCReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the interRAT handover is performed.

The network applies the procedure as follows:
- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT;
- to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
5.4.2.3 Reception of the RRCReconfiguration by the UE

The UE shall:
1> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIBI;

1> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
\( 1> \) perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
