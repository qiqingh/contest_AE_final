\( 4> \) if the eventA1 or eventA2 is configured in the corresponding reportConfig:
\( 5> \) consider only the serving cell to be applicable;
\( 4> \) if the eventA3 or eventA5 is configured in the corresponding reportConfig:
\( 5> \) if a serving cell is associated with a measObjectNR and neighbours are associated with another measObjectNR, consider any serving cell associated with the other measObjectNR to be a neighbouring cell as well;

4> if corresponding reportConfig includes reportType set to periodical; or
4> for measurement events other than eventAl or eventA2:
\( 5> \) if useAllowedCellList is set to true:
\( 6> \) consider any neighbouring cell detected based on parameters in the associated measObjectNR to be applicable when the concerned cell is included in the allowedCellsToAddModList defined within the VarMeasConfig for this measId;

5> else:
\( 6> \) consider any neighbouring cell detected based on parameters in the associated measObjectNR to be applicable when the concerned cell is not included in the excludedCellsToAddModList defined within the VarMeasConfig for this measId;
\( 3> \) else if the corresponding measObject concerns E-UTRA:
\( 4> \) if eventB1 or eventB2 is configured in the corresponding reportConfig:
\( 5> \) consider a serving cell, if any, on the associated E-UTRA frequency as neighbour cell;
\( 4> \) consider any neighbouring cell detected on the associated frequency to be applicable when the concerned cell is not included in the excludedCellsToAddModListEUTRAN defined within the VarMeasConfig for this measId;
\( 3> \) else if the corresponding measObject concerns UTRA-FDD:
4> if eventB1-UTRA-FDD or eventB2-UTRA-FDD is configured in the corresponding reportConfig; or
4> if corresponding reportConfig includes reportType set to periodical:
\( 5> \) consider a neighbouring cell on the associated frequency to be applicable when the concerned cell is included in the cellsToAddModList defined within the VarMeasConfig for this measId;

3> else if the corresponding measObject concerns L2 U2N Relay UE:
\( 4> \) if eventY1-Relay is configured in the corresponding reportConfig; or
4> if corresponding reportConfig includes reportType set to periodical:
\( 5> \) consider any L2 U2N Relay UE detected on the associated frequency to be applicable for this measld;
\( 2> \) else if the corresponding reportConfig includes a reportType set to reportCGI:
3> consider the cell detected on the associated measObject which has a physical cell identity matching the value of the cellForWhichToReportCGI included in the corresponding reportConfig within the VarMeasConfig to be applicable;
\( 2> \) else if the corresponding reportConfig includes a reportType set to reportSFTD:
\( 3> \) if the corresponding measObject concerns NR:
4> if the reportSFTD-Meas is set to true:
\( 5> \) consider the NR PSCell to be applicable;
