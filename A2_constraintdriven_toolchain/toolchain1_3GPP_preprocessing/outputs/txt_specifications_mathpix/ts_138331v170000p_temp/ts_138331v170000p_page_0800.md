\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List \\
A set of UE specific channel bandwidth and location configurations for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The UE uses the configuration provided in this field only for the purpose of channel bandwidth and location determination. If absent, UE uses the configuration indicated in scsSpecificCarrierList in DownlinkConfigCommon / DownlinkConfigCommonS/B. Network only configures channel bandwidth that corresponds to the channel bandwidth values defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dummy1, dummy 2 \\
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableBeamSwitchTiming \\
Indicates the aperiodic CSI-RS triggering with beam switching triggering behaviour as defined in clause 5.2.1.5.1 of TS 38.214 [19].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableDefauItTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex \\
Presence of this field indicates the UE shall follow the release 16 behavior of default TCI state per CORESETPoolindex when the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in ControlResourceSet is enabled.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableTwo Defau/tTCI-States \\
Presence of this field indicates the UE shall follow the release 16 behavior of two default TCI states for PDSCH when at least one TCI codepoint is mapped to two TCI states is enabled
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fomed-ReceptionMulticast \\
Indicates the Type-1 HARQ codebook generation as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstActiveDowniinkBWP-Id \\
If configured for an SpCell, this field contains the ID of the DL BWP to be activated or to be used for RLM, BFD and measurements if included in an RRCReconfiguration message contained in an NR or E-UTRA RRC message indicating that the SCG is deactivated, upon performing the RRC (re-)configuration. If the field is absent, the RRC (re)configuration does not impose a BWP switch. If the field is absent for the PSCell at SCG deactivation, the UE considers the previously activated DL BWP as the BWP to be used for RLM, BFD and measurements. If the field is absent for the PSCell at SCG activation, the DL BWP to be activated is the DL BWP previously to be used for RLM, BFD and measurements. \\
If configured for an SCell, this field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon activation of an SCell. The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id = 0. \\
Upon reconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync, the network sets the firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id and firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id to the same value.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
initialDownlinkBWP \\
The dedicated (UE-specific) configuration for the initial downlink bandwidth-part (i.e. DL BWP\#0). If any of the optional IEs are configured within this IE, the UE considers the BWP\#0 to be an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Otherwise, the UE does not consider the BWP\#0 as an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Network always configures the UE with a value for this field if no other BWPs are configured. NOTE1
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intraCellGuardBandsDL-List, intraCellGuardBandsUL-List \\
List of intra-cell guard bands in a serving cell for operation with shared spectrum channel access. If not configured, the guard bands are defined according to 38.101-1 [15], see TS 38.214 [19], clause 7. For operation in licensed spectrum, this field is absent, and no UE action is required.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ite-CRS-PatternList1 \\
A list of LTE CRS patterns around which the UE shall do rate matching for PDSCH. The LTE CRS patterns in this list shall be non-overlapping in frequency. The network does not configure this field and Ite-CRS-ToMatchAround simultaneously.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ite-CRS-PatternList2 \\
A list of LTE CRS patterns around which the UE shall do rate matching for PDSCH scheduled with a DCI detected on a CORESET with CORESETPoolIndex configured with 1. This list is configured only if CORESETPoollndex configured with 1. The first LTE CRS pattern in this list shall be fully overlapping in frequency with the first LTE CRS pattern in lte-CRS-PatternList1, The second LTE CRS pattern in this list shall be fully overlapping in frequency with the second LTE CRS pattern in Ite-CRS-PatternList1, and so on. Network configures this field only if the field /te-CRS-ToMatchAround is not configured and there is at least one ControlResourceSet in one DL BWP of this serving cell with coresetPoollndex set to 1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ite-CRS-ToMatchAround \\
Parameters to determine an LTE CRS pattern that the UE shall rate match around.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nr-di-PRS-PDC-info \\
Configures the DL PRS for propagation delay compensation. When configured, the UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference based on the reference signals configured in this field.
\end{tabular} \\
