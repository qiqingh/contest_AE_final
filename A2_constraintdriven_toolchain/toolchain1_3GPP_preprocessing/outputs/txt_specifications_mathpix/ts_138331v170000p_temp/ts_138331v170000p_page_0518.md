\hline CG-StartingOffsets field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-StartingFullBW-insideCOT \\
A set of configured grant PUSCH transmission starting offsets which indicates the length of a CP extension of the first symbol that is located before the configured resource when frequency domain resource allocation includes all interlaces in the allocated RB set(s) and the CG PUSCH resource is inside gNB COT (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-StartingFullBW-OutsideCOT \\
A set of configured grant PUSCH transmission starting offset indices (see TS 38.211[16], Table 5.3.1-2) which indicates the length of a CP extension of the first symbol that is located before the configured resource when frequency domain resource allocation includes all interlaces in the allocated RB set(s) and the CG PUSCH resource is outside gNB COT (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-StartingPartialBW-insideCOT \\
A set of configured grant PUSCH transmission starting offset index (see TS 38.211[16], Table 5.3.1-2) which indicates the length of a CP extension of the first symbol that is located before the configured resource when frequency domain resource allocation does not include all interlaces in the allocated RB set(s) and the CG PUSCH resource is inside gNB COT (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cg-StartingPartiaIBW-OutsideCOT \\
A set of configured grant PUSCH transmission starting offset index (see TS 38.211[16], Table 5.3.1-2) which indicates the length of a CP extension of the first symbol that is located before the configured resource when frequency domain resource allocation does not include all interlaces in the allocated RB set(s) and the CG PUSCH resource is outside gNB COT (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3).

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CG-SDT-Configuration field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-DMRS-Ports \\
Indicates the set of DMRS ports for SSB to PUSCH mapping (see TS 38.213 [13]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-NrofDMRS-Sequences \\
Indicates the number of DMRS ports for SSB to PUSCH mapping (see TS 38.213 [13]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-SSB-Subset \\
Indicates SSB subset for SSB to CG PUSCH mapping within one CG configuration. If this field is absent, UE assumes the SSB set includes all actually transmitted SSBs configured by SIB1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-SSB-PerCG-PUSCH \\
The number of SSBs per CG PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13]). Value one corresponds to 1 SSBs per CG PUSCH, value two corresponds to 2 SSBs per CG PUSCH and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-P0-PUSCH \\
Indicates P0 value for PUSCH for CG SDT in steps of 1dB (see TS 38.213 [13]). When this field is configured, the UE ignores the p0-PUSCH-Alpha.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdt-Alpha \\
Indicates alpha value for PUSCH for CG SDT. alpha 0 indicates value 0 is used alpha04 indicates value 4 is used and so on (see TS 38.213 [13]). When this field is configured, the UE ignores the p0-PUSCH-Alpha.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline LCH-BasedPrioritization & This field is optionally present, Need R, if Ich-BasedPrioritization is configured in the MAC entity. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline RepTypeB & The field is optionally present if pusch-RepTypeIndicator is set to pusch-RepTypeB, Need S, and absent otherwise. \\
\hline CG-List & The field is mandatory present when included in configuredGrantConfigToAddModList-r16, otherwise the field is absent. \\
\hline CG-IndexMAC & The field is mandatory present if at least one configured grant is configured by configuredGrantConfigToAddModList-r16 in any BWP of this MAC entity, otherwise it is optionally present, need \( R \). \\
