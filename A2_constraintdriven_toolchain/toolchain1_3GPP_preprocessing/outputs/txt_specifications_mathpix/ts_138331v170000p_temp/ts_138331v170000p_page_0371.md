\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CarrierinfoNR field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierFreq \\
Indicates the redirected NR frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssbSubcarrierSpacing \\
Subcarrier spacing of SSB in the redirected SSB frequency. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15 or 30 kHz \\
FR2-1: 120 or 240 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc \\
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration for the redirected SSB frequency. It is based on timing reference of PCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing.
\end{tabular} \\

\hline & RAN-NotificationArealnfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellist \\
A list of cells configured as RAN area.
\end{tabular} & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

A list of RAN area codes or RA code(s) as RAN area.
\end{tabular} & \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PLMN-RAN-AreaConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pimn-identity \\
PLMN Identity to which the cells in ran-Area belong. If the field is absent the UE not in SNPN access mode uses the ID of the registered PLMN. This field is not included for UE in SNPN access mode (for UE in SNPN access mode the ran-Area always belongs to the registered SNPN).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ran-AreaCodeList \\
The total number of RAN-AreaCodes of all PLMNs does not exceed 32.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ran-Area \\
Indicates whether TA code(s) or RAN area code(s) are used for the RAN notification area. The network uses only TA code(s) or both TA code(s) and RAN area code(s) to configure a UE. The total number of TACs across all PLMNs does not exceed 16.
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PLMN-RAN-AreaCell field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pimn-identity \\
PLMN Identity to which the cells in ran-AreaCells belong. If the field is absent the UE not in SNPN access mode uses the ID of the registered PLMN. This field is not included for UE in SNPN access mode (for UE in SNPN access mode the ran-AreaCells always belongs to the registered SNPN).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ran-AreaCells \\
The total number of cells of all PLMNs does not exceed 32.
