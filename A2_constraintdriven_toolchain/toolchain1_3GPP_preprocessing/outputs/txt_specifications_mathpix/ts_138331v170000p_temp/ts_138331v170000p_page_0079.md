\( 4> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the needForGapsConfigNR; or
\( 4> \) if the NeedForGapsInfoNR information is changed compared to last time the UE reported this information:
\( 5> \) include the NeedForGapsInfoNR and set the contents as follows:
6> include intraFreq-needForGap and set the gap requirement information of intra-frequency measurement for each NR serving cell;

6> if requestedTargetBandFilterNR is configured, for each supported NR band that is also included in requestedTargetBandFilterNR, include an entry in interFreq-needForGap and set the gap requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry in interFreqneedForGap and set the corresponding gap requirement information for each supported NR band;
\( 3> \) if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of NR target bands:

4> if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the needForNCSG-ConfigNR; or
4> if the needForNCSG-InfoNR information is changed compared to last time the UE reported this information:
\( 5> \) include the NeedForNCSG-InfoNR and set the contents as follows:
6> include intraFreq-needForNCSG and set the gap and NCSG requirement information of intrafrequency measurement for each NR serving cell;

6> if requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-NR is configured, for each supported NR band included in requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-NR, include an entry in interFreq-needForNCSG and set the NCSG requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry for each supported NR band in interFreq-needForNCSG and set the corresponding NCSG requirement information;

3> if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of E-UTRA target bands:
\( 4> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message includes the needForNCSG-ConfigEUTRA; or
\( 4> \) if the needForNCSG-InfoEUTRA information is changed compared to last time the UE reported this information:

5> include the NeedForNCSG-InfoEUTRA and set the contents as follows:
\( 6> \) if requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-EUTRA is configured, for each supported E-UTRA band included in requestedTargetBandFitterNCSG-EUTRA, include an entry in needForNCSGEUTRA and set the NCSG requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry for each supported E-UTRA band in needForNCSG-EUTRA and set the corresponding NCSG requirement information;
\( 1> \) if the UE is configured with E-UTRA nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig (UE in (NG)EN-DC):
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received via E-UTRA SRB1 as specified in TS 36.331 [10]; or
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received via E-UTRA RRC message RRCConnectionReconfiguration within MobilityFromNRCommand (handover from NR standalone to (NG)EN-DC);

3> if the RRCReconfiguration is applied due to a conditional reconfiguration execution for CPC which is configured via conditionalReconfiguration contained in nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig specified in TS 36.331 [10]:

4> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via the E-UTRA MCG embedded in E-UTRA RRC message ULInformation TransferMRDC as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.2a.
