\( 1> \) if sl-DRX-ConfigUC-ToReleaseList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) for each \( S L \)-DestinationIndex included in the received sl-DRX-ConfigUC-ToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration:
\( 3> \) remove the entry with the matching \( S L \)-DestinationIndex from the stored NR sidelink DRX configuration information;
\( 1> \) if \( s \)-DRX-Config UC-ToAddModList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) for each sl-DestinationIndex included in the received sl-DRX-ConfigUC-ToAddModList that is part of the current stored NR sidelink DRX configuration:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the entry according to the value received for this \( s \)-DestinationIndex from the stored NR sidelink DRX configuration information;
\( 2> \) for each \( s \)-DestinationIndex included in the received \( s \)-DRX-ConfigUC-ToAddModList that is not part of the current stored NR sidelink DRX configuration:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for this \( s \)-DestinationIndex to the stored NR sidelink DRX configuration.
\( 1> \) if \( s \)-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) perform PC5 Relay RLC channel release as specified in 5.8.9.1.2;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) /-RLC-ChannelToAddModList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) perform PC5 Relay RLC channel addition/modification as specified in 5.8.9.1.2;
5.3.5.15 L2 U2N Relay UE configuration
5.3.5.15.1 General

The network configures the L2 U2N Relay UE with relay operation related configurations. For each connected L2 U2N Remote UE indicated in sl-L2Identity-Remote, the network provides the configuration parameters used for data relaying.

The UE performs the following actions based on a received s/-L2RelayUEConfig:
\( 1> \) if the sl-L2RelayUEConfig contains the sl-RemoteUE-ToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) perform the L2 U2N Remote UE release as specified in 5.3.5.15.2;
\( 1> \) if the sl-L2RelayUEConfig contains the sl-RemoteUE-ToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform the L2 U2N Remote UE addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.15.3;
5.3.5.15.2 L2 U2N Remote UE Release

The L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the release is triggered by reception of the \( s / \)-RemoteUE-ToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) for each sl-L2Identity-Remote value included in the s/-RemoteUE-ToReleaseList:
\( 3> \) if the current UE has a PC5 RRC connection to a L2 U2N Remote UE with sl-L2Identity-Remote: 4 perform the PC5-RRC connection release as specified in 5.8.9.5.
5.3.5.15.3 L2 U2N Remote UE Addition/Modification

The L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-L2Identity-Remote value included in the \( s \)-RemoteUE-ToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (L2 U2N Remote UE Addition):
