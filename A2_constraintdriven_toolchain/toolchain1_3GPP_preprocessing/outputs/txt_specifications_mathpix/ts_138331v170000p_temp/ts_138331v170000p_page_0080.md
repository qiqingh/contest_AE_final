3> else if the RRCReconfiguration message was included in E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume message:
4> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via E-UTRA embedded in E-UTRA RRC message RRCConnectionResumeComplete as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.3.4a;
\( 3> \) else:
4> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete via E-UTRA embedded in E-UTRA RRC message RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.5.3/5.3.5.4/5.4.2.3;

3> if the scg-State is not included in the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message containing the RRCReconfiguration message:
\( 4> \) if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG; or
4> if the SCG was deactivated before the reception of the E-UTRA RRC message containing the RRCReconfiguration message and lower layers consider that a Random Access procedure is needed for SCG activation:

5> initiate the Random Access procedure on the SpCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
4> else:
\( 5> \) the procedure ends;
3> else:
4> the procedure ends;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received within \( n r \)-SecondaryCellGroupConfig in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message received via SRB3 within DLInformationTransferMRDC:

3> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete via E-UTRA embedded in E-UTRA RRC message RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.5.3/5.3.5.4;

3> if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG:
\( 4> \) initiate the Random Access procedure on the SpCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
3> else:
4> the procedure ends;
NOTE 1: The order the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is left to UE implementation.
\( 2> \) else (RRCReconfiguration was received via SRB3) but not within DLInformationTransferMRDC:
3> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB3 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;

NOTE 2: In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, in the case RRCReconfiguration is received via SRB1 or within DLInformationTransferMRDC via SRB3, the random access is triggered by RRC layer itself as there is not necessarily other UL transmission. In the case RRCReconfiguration is received via SRB3 but not within DLInformationTransferMRDC, the random access is triggered by the MAC layer due to arrival of RRCReconfigurationComplete-

1> else if the RRCReconfiguration message was received via SRB1 within the nr-SCG within mrdcSecondaryCellGroup (UE in NR-DC, mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup was received in RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume via SRB1):
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration is applied due to a conditional reconfiguration execution for CPC which is configured via conditionalReconfiguration contained in \( n r \)-SCG within mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup:

3> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via the NR MCG embedded in NR RRC message ULInformationTransferMRDC as specified in clause 5.7.2a_3.
