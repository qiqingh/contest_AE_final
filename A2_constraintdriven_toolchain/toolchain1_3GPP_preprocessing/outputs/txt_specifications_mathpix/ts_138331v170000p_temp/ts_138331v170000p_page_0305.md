identity is also included in the NR sidelink measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
4. NR sidelink quantity configurations: The NR sidelink quantity configuration defines the NR sidelink measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that NR sidelink measurement. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different NR sidelink measurement quantities.

Both UEs of the PC5-RRC connection maintains a NR sidelink measurement object list, a NR sidelink reporting configuration list, and a NR sidelink measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification.
5.8.10.2 Sidelink measurement configuration
5.8.10.2.1 General

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the received \( s \)-MeasConfig includes the \( s \) /-MeasObjectToRemoveList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink measurement object removal procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.4;
\( 1> \) if the received \( s \) /-MeasConfig includes the s/-MeasObjectToAddModList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink measurement object addition/modification procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.5;
\( 1> \) if the received \( s \)-MeasConfig includes the sl-ReportConfigToRemoveList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink reporting configuration removal procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.6;
\( 1> \) if the received sl-MeasConfig includes the sl-ReportConfigToAddModList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink reporting configuration addition/modification procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.7;
\( 1> \) if the received \( s \)-MeasConfig includes the \( s \)-QuantityConfig in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink quantity configuration procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.8;
\( 1> \) if the received \( s / \)-MeasConfig includes the \( s / \)-MeasIdToRemoveList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink measurement identity removal procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.2;
\( 1> \) if the received \( s \)-MeasConfig includes the sl-MeasIdToAddModList in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink measurement identity addition/modification procedure as specified in 5.8.10.2.3;
5.8.10.2.2 Sidelink measurement identity removal

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-Measld included in the received \( s \) /-MeasldToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching sl-Measld from the sl-MeasldList within the VarMeasConfigSL;
\( 2> \) remove the NR sidelink measurement reporting entry for this \( s \)-Measld from the VarMeasReportListSL, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer and reset the associated information (e.g. sl-TimeToTrigger) for this slMeasld.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the \( s / \)-MeasldToRemoveList includes any slMeasld value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
