\( 2> \) apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource configuration that require the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell (e.g. measurement gaps, periodic CQI reporting, scheduling request configuration, sounding RS configuration), if any, upon acquiring the SFN of that target SpCell;
\( 2> \) for each DRB configured as DAPS bearer, request uplink data switching to the PDCP entity, as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) if the reconfiguration WithSync was included in spCellConfig of an MCG:
\( 3> \) if T390 is running:
4 stop timer T390 for all access categories;
4> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4.
\( 3> \) if T350 is running:
\( 4> \) stop timer T 350 ;
\( 3> \) if RRCReconfiguration does not include dedicatedSIB1-Delivery and
\( 3> \) if the active downlink BWP, which is indicated by the firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id for the target SpCell of the MCG, has a common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1:
\( 4> \) acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13], of the target SpCell of the MCG;
4 upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2;
\( 2> \) if the reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an MCG; or
\( 2> \) if the reconfiguration WithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG and the CPA or CPC was configured
\( 3> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 3> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.5.9.6, if any;
\( 3> \) for each measld of the source SpCell configuration, if the associated reportConfig has a reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
\( 4> \) for the associated reportConfigld:
\( 5> \) remove the entry with the matching reportConfigld from the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 4> \) if the associated measObjectld is only associated to a reportConfig with reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
\( 5> \) remove the entry with the matching measObjectld from the measObjectList within the VarMeasConfig;

4> remove the entry with the matching measld from the measldList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) if reconfigurationWithSync was included in masterCellGroup or secondaryCellGroup:
\( 3> \) if the UE initiated transmission of a UEAssistancelnformation message for the corresponding cell group during the last 1 second, and the UE is still configured to provide the concerned UE assistance information for the corresponding cell group; or
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message is applied due to a conditional reconfiguration execution, and the UE is configured to provide UE assistance information for the corresponding cell group, and the UE has initiated transmission of a UEAssistancelnformation message for the corresponding cell group since it was configured to do so in accordance with 5.7.4.2:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of a UEAssistanceInformation message for the corresponding cell group in accordance with clause 5.7.4.3 to provide the concerned UE assistance information;
