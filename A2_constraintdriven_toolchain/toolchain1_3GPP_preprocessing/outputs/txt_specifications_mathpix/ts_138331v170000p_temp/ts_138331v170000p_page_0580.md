\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline LogicalChannelConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedCG-List \\
This restriction applies only when the UL grant is a configured grant. If present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be mapped to the indicated configured grant configuration. If the size of the sequence is zero, then UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel cannot be mapped to any configured grant configurations. If the field is not present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be mapped to any configured grant configurations. If the field configuredGrantType1Allowed is present, only those configured grant type 1 configuration indicated in this sequence are allowed for use by this logical channel; otherwise, this sequence shall not include any configured grant type 1 configuration. Corresponds to "allowedCG-List" as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedHARQ-mode \\
Indicates the allowed HARQ mode of a HARQ process mapped to this logical channel. If the parameter is not configured, there is no restriction for HARQ mode for the mapping. This field also applies to SRB1, SRB2 and SRB3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedPHY-Prioritylndex \\
This restriction applies only when the UL grant is a dynamic grant. If the field is present and the dynamic grant has a PHY-priority index, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be mapped to the dynamic grants indicating PHY-priority index equal to the values configured by this field. If the field is present and the dynamic grant does not have a PHY-priority index, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be mapped to this dynamic grant if the value of the field is \( p 0 \), see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9. If the field is not present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be mapped to any dynamic grants. Corresponds to "allowedPHY-Prioritylndex" as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedSCS-List \\
If present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be mapped to the indicated numerology. Otherwise, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be mapped to any configured numerology. Corresponds to 'allowedSCS-List' as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15,30 , or 60 kHz \\
FR2-1: 60 or 120 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedServingCells \\
If present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be mapped to the serving cells indicated in this list. Otherwise, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be mapped to any configured serving cell of this cell group. Corresponds to 'allowedServingCells' in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bitRateMultiplier \\
Bit rate multiplier for recommended bit rate MAC CE as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value \( x 40 \) indicates bit rate multiplier 40, value \( x 70 \) indicates bit rate multiplier 70 and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bitRateQueryProhibitTimer \\
The timer is used for bit rate recommendation query in TS 38.321 [3], in seconds. Value s0 means 0 s , s0dot4 means 0.4 s and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bucketSizeDuration \\
Value in ms. ms 5 corresponds to 5 ms , value ms 10 corresponds to 10 ms , and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelAccessPriority \\
Indicates the Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), as specified in TS 38.300 [2], to be used on uplink transmissions for operation with shared spectrum channel access. The network configures this field only for SRB2 and DRBs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantType1Allowed \\
If present, or if the capability lcp-Restriction as specified in TS 38.306 [26] is not supported, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be transmitted on a configured grant type 1. Otherwise, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel cannot be transmitted on a configured grant type 1. Corresponds to 'configuredGrantType1Allowed' in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
IogicalChannelGroup, IogicalChannelGroup-IAB-Ext \\
ID of the logical channel group, as specified in TS 38.321 [3], which the logical channel belongs to. The logicalChannelGroup-IAB-Ext is only applicable to the IAB-MT. When logicalChannelGroup-IAB-Ext is configured, logicalChannelGroup shall be ignored.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
IogicalChanneISR-Mask \\
Controls SR triggering when a configured uplink grant of type1 or type2 is configured. true indicates that SR masking is configured for this logical channel as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied \\
Indicates whether to apply the delay timer for SR transmission for this logical channel. Set to false if logicalChannelSR-Delay Timer is not included in BSR-Config.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
