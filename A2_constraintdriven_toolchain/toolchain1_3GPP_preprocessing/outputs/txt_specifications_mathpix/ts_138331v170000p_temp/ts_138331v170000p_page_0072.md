5.3.5 RRC reconfiguration
5.3.5.1 General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release RBs/BH RLC channels, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell groups, to add/modify/release conditional handover configuration, to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change or conditional PSCell addition configuration. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the Network to the UE.

RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but is not limited to, the following cases:
- reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit L2 indicators;
- reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit L2 indicators.
- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS and security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
- for non-DAPS bearer: refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit L2 indicators;
- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for the target PCell, refresh of security and reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
- for SRB: refresh of security and establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell;
- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS but without security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
- for non-DAPS bearer: RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit L2 indicators.
- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for target PCell, reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
