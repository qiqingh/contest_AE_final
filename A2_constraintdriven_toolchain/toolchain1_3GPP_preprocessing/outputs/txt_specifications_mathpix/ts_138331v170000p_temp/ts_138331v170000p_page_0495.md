\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline GoodServingCellEvaluation field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
offset \\
The parameter " X " (dB) for the good serving cell quality criterion in RRC_CONNECTED, for a cell operating in FR1 and FR2, respectively. If this field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of \( [0] \mathrm{dB} \) for " X ".

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline ReconfigurationWithSync field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rach-ConfigDedicated \\
Random access configuration to be used for the reconfiguration with sync (e.g. handover). The UE performs the RA according to these parameters in the firstActiveUplinkBWP (see UplinkConfig).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc \\
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and NR PCell change. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon. \\
For case of NR PCell change, the smtc is based on the timing reference of (source) PCell. For case of NR PSCell change, it is based on the timing reference of source PSCell. If both this field and targetCellSMTC-SCG are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SCellConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deactivatedMeasGapList \\
Indicates a list of gap ID(s) where the corresponding pre-configured measurement gaps (i.e. the gaps configured with preConfig/nd) are deactivated while this SCell is deactivated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
goodServingCellEvaluationBFD \\
Indicates the criterion for a UE to detect the good serving cell quality for BFD relaxation in an SCell in RRC_CONNECTED.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc \\
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssbperiodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
