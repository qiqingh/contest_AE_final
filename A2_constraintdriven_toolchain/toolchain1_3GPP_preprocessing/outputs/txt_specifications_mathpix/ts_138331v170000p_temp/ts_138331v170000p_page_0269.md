5.7.15.2 Actions Related to SRS for Positioning at Cell Re-selection in RRC_INACTIVE

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if cell reselection occurs when srs-PosRRC-InactiveConfig is configured:
\( 2> \) consider the Timing Advance value for SRS for Positioning transmission to be invalid;
\( 2> \) release the srs-PosRRC-InactiveConfig.
Editor's Note: To check further if clause 5.7.14 and 5.7.15 can be consolidated under new clause 5.X NR Positioning similar to clause 5.8 Sidelink.

The purpose of this procedure is to send application layer measurement reports to the network.
5.7.16.2 Initiation

A UE capable of application layer measurement reporting in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure when configured with application layer measurement, i.e. when appLayerMeasConfig and SRB4 have been configured by the network.

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each measConfigAppLayerId:
\( 2> \) if the UE AS has received, but not sent, application layer measurement report from upper layers; and
