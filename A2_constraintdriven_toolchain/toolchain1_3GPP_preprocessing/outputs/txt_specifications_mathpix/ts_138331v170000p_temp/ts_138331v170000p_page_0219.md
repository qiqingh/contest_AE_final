5.7.1a DL information transfer for MR-DC
5.7.1a. 1 General

Figure 5.7.1a.1-1: DL information transfer MR-DC

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer RRC messages from the network to the UE over SRB3 (e.g. an NR RRC reconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync, an E-UTRA RRC connection reconfiguration message including mobilityControllnfo, an RRC connection release message, a MobilityFromNRCommand message, or a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message) during fast MCG link recovery.
5.7.1a. 2 Initiation

The network initiates this procedure whenever there is a need to transfer an RRC message during fast MCG link recovery.
5.7.1a. 3 Actions related to reception of DLInformationTransferMRDC message

Upon receiving the DLInformationTransferMRDC, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message is included in dl-DCCH-MessageNR:
\( 2> \) perform the RRC reconfiguration procedure according to 5.3.5.3;
1> else if the RRCRelease message is included in dl-DCCH-MessageNR:
\( 2> \) perform the RRC release procedure according to 5.3.8;
1> else if the MobilityFromNRCommand message is included in the dl-DCCH-MessageNR:
\( 2> \) perform the mobility from NR procedure according to 5.4.3.3;
\( 1> \) else if the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is included in dl-DCCH-MessageEUTRA:
\( 2> \) perform the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.5.4;
1> else if the E-UTRA RRCConnectionRelease message is included in dl-DCCH-MessageEUTRA:
\( 2> \) perform the RRC connection release as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.8;
\( 1> \) else if the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message is included in the dl-DCCH-MessageEUTRA:
\( 2> \) perform the mobility from E-UTRA procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.4.3.3;
