\hline SIB9 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dayLightSavingTime \\
Indicates if and how daylight-saving time (DST) is applied to obtain the local time. The semantics are the same as the semantics of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.501 [23] and TS 24.008 [38]. The first/leftmost bit of the bit string contains the b2 of octet 3 and the second bit of the bit string contains b1 of octet 3 in the value part of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.008 [38].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
leapSeconds \\
Number of leap seconds offset between GPS Time and UTC. UTC and GPS time are related i.e. GPS time -leapSeconds = UTC time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
loca/TimeOffset \\
Offset between UTC and local time in units of 15 minutes. Actual value \( = \) field value \( { }^{*} 15 \) minutes. Local time of the day is calculated as UTC time + localTimeOffset.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeInfoUTC \\
Coordinated Universal Time corresponding to the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted. The field counts the number of UTC seconds in 10 ms units since 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Sunday, December 31, 1899 and Monday, January 1, 1900). See NOTE 1. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of time/nfoUTC should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of value Tag in SIB1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

NOTE 1: The UE may use this field together with the leapSeconds field to obtain GPS time as follows: GPS Time (in seconds) \( = \) timelnfoUTC (in seconds) 2,524,953,600 (seconds) + leapSeconds, where 2,524,953,600 is the number of seconds between 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 and 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time).
