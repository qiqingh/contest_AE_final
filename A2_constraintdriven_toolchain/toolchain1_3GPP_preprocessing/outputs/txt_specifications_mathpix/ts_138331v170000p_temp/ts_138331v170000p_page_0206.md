\( 2> \) set measResultRxTxTimeDiff to the latest measurement result;
Editor's note ([IoT): It is assumed (without explicit RAN2 agreements) that only the latest measurement is included in the report, e.g., no filtered measurement, no multiple measurement reports. Proponent companies for other measurement reporting can bring discussion paper in the maintenance phase.
\( 1> \) increment the numberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId by 1;
\( 1> \) stop the periodical reporting timer, if running;
\( 1> \) if the numberOfReportsSent as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId is less than the reportAmount as defined within the corresponding reportConfig for this measld:
\( 2> \) start the periodical reporting timer with the value of reportInterval as defined within the corresponding reportConfig for this measId;

1> else:
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to periodical or cli-Periodical or rxTxPeriodical:
\( 3> \) remove the entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
\( 3> \) remove this measld from the measIdList within VarMeasConfig;
\( 1> \) if the measurement reporting was configured by asl-ConfigDedicatedNR received within the
RRCConnection Reconfiguration:
\( 2> \) submit the MeasurementReport message to lower layers for transmission via SRB1, embedded in E-UTRA RRC message ULInformationTransferIRAT as specified TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.28;
\( 1> \) else if the UE is in (NG)EN-DC:
\( 2> \) if SRB3 is configured and the SCG is not deactivated:
3> submit the MeasurementReport message via SRB3 to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
\( 2> \) else:
3> submit the MeasurementReport message via E-UTRA embedded in E-UTRA RRC message ULInformationTransferMRDC as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
\( 1> \) else if the UE is in NR-DC:
\( 2> \) if the measurement configuration that triggered this measurement report is associated with the SCG:
\( 3> \) if SRB3 is configured and the SCG is not deactivated:
4> submit the MeasurementReport message via SRB3 to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;

3> else:
4> submit the MeasurementReport message via SRB1 embedded in NR RRC message
ULInformationTransferMRDC as specified in 5.7.2a.3;
\( 2> \) else:
3> submit the MeasurementReport message via SRB1 to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;

1> else:
\( 2> \) submit the MeasurementReport message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
