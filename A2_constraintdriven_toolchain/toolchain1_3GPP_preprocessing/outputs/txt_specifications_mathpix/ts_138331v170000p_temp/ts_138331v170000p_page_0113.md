corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarConditionalReconfig; or
\( 3> \) if the condEventld is associated with condEventA3, condEventA4 or condEventA5, and if the leaving condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the condReconfigld, i.e the event corresponding with the condEventld(s) of the corresponding condTriggerConfig within VarConditionalReconfig, is fulfilled for the applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarConditionalReconfig:
\( 4> \) consider the event associated to that measld to be not fulfilled;
\( 2> \) if event(s) associated to all measld(s) within condTriggerConfig for a target candidate cell within the stored condRRCReconfig are fulfilled:
\( 3> \) consider the target candidate cell within the stored condRRCReconfig, associated to that condReconfigld, as a triggered cell;
\( 3> \) initiate the conditional reconfiguration execution, as specified in 5.3.5.13.5;
NOTE: Up to 2 Measld can be configured for each condReconfigld. The conditional reconfiguration event of the 2 Measld may have the same or different event conditions, triggering quantity, time to trigger, and triggering threshold.
5.3.5.13.4a Conditional reconfiguration evaluation of SN initiated inter-SN CPC for EN-DC

Editors Note: FFS If EN-DC support in 5.3.5.13.4a should be merged to 5.3.5.13.4.
The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each condReconfigld within the VarConditionalReconfig specified in TS 36.331[10],:
\( 1> \) in the remainder of the procedures, consider each measId indicated in the IE of CondReconfigExecCondSN contained in the triggerConditionSN as specified in TS 36.331[10], as a measld in the VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig;
\( 1> \) for each measld included in the measldList within VarMeasConfig indicated in the CondReconfigExecCondSN contained in the triggerConditionSN associated to the condReconfigurationId as specified in TS 36.331[10]:
\( 2> \) if the entry condition(s) applicable for the event associated with that measld, is fulfilled for the applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event associated with that measld:
\( 3> \) consider this event to be fulfilled;
\( 2> \) if the measld for this event has been modified; or
\( 2> \) if the leaving condition(s) applicable for this event associated with that measld, is fulfilled for the applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during the corresponding timeToTrigger defined for this event associated with that measld:
\( 3> \) consider this event associated to that measld to be not fulfilled;
\( 1> \) if trigger conditions for all events associated with the measId(s) indicated in the IE of CondReconfigExecCondSN contained in the triggerConditionSN as specified in TS 36.331[10]), are fulfilled:
\( 2> \) consider the target cell candidate within the RRCReconfiguration message contained in \( n r \) -
