\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline FrequencyinfoUL field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absoluteFrequencyPointA \\
Absolute frequency of the reference resource block (Common RB 0). Its lowest subcarrier is also known as Point A. Note that the lower edge of the actual carrier is not defined by this field but rather in the scs-SpecificCarrierList (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.4.4.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
additionalSpectrumEmission \\
The additional spectrum emission requirements to be applied by the UE on this uplink. If the field is absent, the UE uses value 0 for the additionalSpectrumEmission (see TS 38.101-1 [15], table 6.2.3.1-1A, and TS 38.101-2 [39], table 6.2.3.1-2). Network configures the same value in additionalSpectrumEmission for all uplink carrier(s) of the same band with UL configured. The additionalSpectrumEmission is applicable for all uplink carriers of the same band with UL configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyBandList \\
List containing only one frequency band to which this carrier(s) belongs. Multiple values are not supported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyShift7p5khz \\
Enable the NR UL transmission with a 7.5 kHz shift to the LTE raster. If the field is absent, the frequency shift is disabled.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-Max \\
Maximum transmit power allowed in this serving cell. The maximum transmit power that the UE may use on this serving cell may be additionally limited by \( p \)-NR-FR1 (configured for the cell group) and by p-UE-FR1 (configured total for all serving cells operating on FR1). If absent, the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.1011 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. Value in dBm. This field is ignored by IAB-MT, the IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scs-SpecificCarrierList \\
A set of carriers for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The network configures a scs-SpecificCarrier at least for each numerology (SCS) that is used e.g. in a BWP (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline FDD-OrSUL & The field is mandatory present if this FrequencylnfoUL is for the paired UL for a DL (defined in a FrequencylinfoDL) or if this FrequencylnfoUL is for a supplementary uplink (SUL). It is absent, Need R, otherwise (if this FrequencylnfoUL is for an unpaired UL (TDD). \\
\hline FDD-TDD-OrSUL-Optional & The field is optionally present, Need R, if this FrequencylinfoUL is for the paired UL for a DL (defined in a FrequencylinfoDL), or if this FrequencylnfoUL is for an unpaired UL (TDD) in certain bands (as defined in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 and in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 38.104 [12]), or if this Frequency/nfoUL is for a supplementary uplink (SUL). It is absent, Need R, otherwise. \\
