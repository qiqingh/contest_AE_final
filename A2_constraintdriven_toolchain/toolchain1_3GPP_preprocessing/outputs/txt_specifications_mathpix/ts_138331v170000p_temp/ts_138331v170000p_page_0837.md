\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sfn-Offset \\
Specifies the SFN offset between the cell in which SSB is transmited and serving cell. The offset corresponds to the number of full radio frames counted from the beginning of a radio frame \#0 of serving cell to the beginning of the closest subsequent radio frame \#0 of the cell in which SSB is transmitted.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sfn-SSB-Offset \\
Indicates the SFN offset of the transmitted SSB relative to the start of the SSB period. Value 0 indicates that the SSB is transmitted in the first system frame, value 1 indicates that SSB is transmitted in the second system frame and so on. The network configures this field according to the field ssb-Periodicity such that the indicated system frame does not exceed the configured SSB periodicity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-Freq \\
Indicates the frequency of the SSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-PBCH-BlockPower \\
Average EPRE of the resources elements that carry secondary synchronization signals in dBm that the NW used for SSB transmission, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-Periodicity \\
Indicates the periodicity of the SSB. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value ms5. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssbSubcarrierSpacing \\
Subcarrier spacing of SSB. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15 or 30 kHz \\
FR2-1: 120 or 240 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline Setup & This field is mandatory present upon configuration of SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-Resource and optionally present, Need M, otherwise. \\
\hline NonCodebook & This field is optionally present, Need M, in case of non-codebook based transmission, otherwise the field is absent. \\
\hline Pathloss & The field is mandatory present if the IE SSB-InfoNcell is included in pathlossReferenceRS-Pos; otherwise it is optionally present, Need R \\

- SRS-RSRP-Range

The IE SRS-RSRP-Range specifies the value range used in SRS-RSRP measurements and thresholds. The integer value for SRS-RSRP measurements is according to Table 10.1.22.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. For thresholds, the actual value is (IE value -140 ) dBm , except for the IE value 98, in which case the actual value is infinity.
