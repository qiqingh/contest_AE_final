\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PLMN-Identityinfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellReservedForOperatorUse \\
Indicates whether the cell is reserved for operator use (per PLMN), as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
iab-Support \\
This field combines both the support of IAB and the cell status for IAB. If the field is present, the cell supports IAB and the cell is also considered as a candidate for cell (re)selection for IAB-node; if the field is absent, the cell does not support IAB and/or the cell is barred for IAB-node.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
trackingAreaCode \\
Indicates Tracking Area Code to which the cell indicated by cellidentity field belongs. The absence of the field indicates that the cell only supports PSCell/SCell functionality (per PLMN).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
trackingAreaList \\
List of Tracking Areas to which the cell indicated by cell/dentity field belongs. If this field is present, the UE shall ignore trackingAreaCode, if present.. Total number of TACs across different PLMNs of the cell cannot exceed maxTAC.
\end{tabular} \\
