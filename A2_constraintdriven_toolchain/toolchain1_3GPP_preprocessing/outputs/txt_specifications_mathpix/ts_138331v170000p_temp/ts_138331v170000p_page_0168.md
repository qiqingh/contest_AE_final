\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching measObjectld from the measObjectList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) remove all measld associated with this measObjectld from the measldList within the VarMeasConfig, if any;
2 if a measld is removed from the measldList:
\( 3> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this measld from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
\( 3> \) stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the measObjectToRemoveList includes any measObjectld value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.5.2.5 Measurement object addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each measObjectld included in the received measObjectToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if an entry with the matching measObjectld exists in the measObjectList within the VarMeasConfig, for this entry:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the entry with the value received for this measObject, except for the fields cellsToAddModList, excludedCellsToAddModList, allowedCellsToAddModList, cellsToRemoveList, excludedCellsToRemoveList, allowedCellsToRemoveList, tx-PoolMeasToRemoveList, txPoolMeasToAddModList, ssb-PositionQCL-CellsToRemoveList, and ssb-PositionQCLCellsToAddModList;
\( 3> \) if the received measObject includes the cellsToRemoveList:
\( 4> \) for each physCellld included in the cellsToRemoveList:
\( 5> \) remove the entry with the matching \( p h y s C e l l l d \) from the cellsToAddModList;
\( 3> \) if the received measObject includes the cellsToAddModList:
4 for each physCellld value included in the cellsToAddModList:
\( 5> \) if an entry with the matching physCellld exists in the cellsToAddModList:
\( 6> \) replace the entry with the value received for this \( p h y s C e l l l d \);
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) add a new entry for the received physCellld to the cellsToAddModList;
\( 3> \) if the received measObject includes the excludedCellsToRemoveList:
\( 4> \) for each pci-Rangelndex included in the excludedCellsToRemoveList:
\( 5> \) remove the entry with the matching pci-Rangelndex from the excludedCellsToAddModList;
NOTE 1: For each pci-RangeIndex included in the excludedCellsToRemoveList that concerns overlapping ranges of cells, a cell is removed from the exclude-list of cells only if all PCI ranges containing it are removed.
\( 3> \) if the received measObject includes the excludedCellsToAddModList:
4 for each pci-Rangelndex included in the excludedCellsToAddModList:
\( 5> \) if an entry with the matching pci-RangeIndex is included in the excludedCellsToAddModList:
\( 6> \) replace the entry with the value received for this pci-RangeIndex;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) add a new entry for the received pci-Rangelndex to the excludedCellsToAddModList;
