\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline LCH-Setup & This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a DRB or a multicast MRB. This field is optionally present, Need S, upon creation of a new logical channel for an SRB. It is optionally present, Need M, otherwise. \\
\hline LCH-SetupModMRB & This field is optionally present upon creation of a new logical channel for a multicast MRB. If this field is included upon creation of a new logical channel for a multicast MRB, it shall be present when modifying this logical channel. The field is absent for logical channels configured for an SRB and a DRB. \\
\hline LCH-SetupOnly & This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a DRB or an SRB (servedRadioBearer). It is absent, Need M otherwise. \\
\hline LCH-SetupOnlyMRB & This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a multicast MRB. It is absent, Need M otherwise. \\
