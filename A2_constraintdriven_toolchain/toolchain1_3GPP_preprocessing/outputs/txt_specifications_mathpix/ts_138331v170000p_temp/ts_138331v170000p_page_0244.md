\( 2> \) if the UE performs RLM measurement relaxation on the cell group according to TS 38.133 [14]:
3> set the rim-MeasRelaxationState to true;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the rim-MeasRelaxationState to false;
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide the relaxation state of BFD measurements of a cell group:
\( 2> \) for each serving cell of the cell group:
3> if the UE performs BFD measurement relaxation on this serving cell according to TS 38.133 [14]:
4> set the n -th bit of bfd-MeasRelaxationState to ' 1 ', where n is equal to the servCellIndex value +1 of the serving cell;

3> else:
4> set the n -th bit of bfd-MeasRelaxationState to ' 0 ', where n is equal to the servCellIndex value +1 of the serving cell.

1> if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to indicate availability of data mapped to radio bearers not configured for SDT according to 5.7.4.2:
\( 2> \) include and set the resumeCause according to the information received from the upper layers, if provided.
1> if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide an indication of preference for SCG deactivation according to 5.7.4.2:
\( 2> \) include scg-DeactivationPreference in the UEAssistanceInformation message;
2> set the scg-DeactivationPreference to scgDeactivationPreferred if the UE prefers the SCG to be deactivated, otherwise set it to noPreference;

1> if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide an indication that the UE has uplink data related to a deactivated SCG according to 5.7.4.2:
\( 2> \) include uplinkData in the UEAssistanceInformation message.
1> if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide an indication about whether the criterion for RRM relaxation for connected mode is fulfilled or not fulfilled:
\( 2> \) if the criterion for RRM measurement relaxation for connected mode is fulfilled:
3> set the rrm-MeasRelaxationFulfilment to true;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the rrm-MeasRelaxationFulfilment to false.
The UE shall set the contents of the UEAssistancelnformation message for configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication:
\( 1> \) if configured to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication:
\( 2> \) include the st-UE-AssistanceInformationNR;
NOTE 4: It is up to UE implementation when and how to trigger configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication.

The UE shall:
1> if the procedure was triggered to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication by an NR RRCReconfiguration message that was embedded within an E-UTRA RRCConnection Reconfiguration:
