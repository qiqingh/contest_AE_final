Figure 5.8.5.1-2: Synchronisation information transmission for NR sidelink communication, out of coverage

The purpose of this procedure is to provide synchronisation information to a UE. This procedure also applies to sidelink discovery.
5.8.5.2 Initiation

A UE capable of NR sidelink communication and SLSS/PSBCH transmission shall, when transmitting NR sidelink communication, and if the conditions for NR sidelink communication operation are met and when the following conditions are met:

1> if in coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]; and has selected GNSS or the cell as synchronization reference as defined in 5.8.6.3; or
\( 1> \) if out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, and the frequency used to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12; and has selected GNSS or the cell as synchronization reference as defined in 5.8.6.3:
\( 2> \) if in RRC_CONNECTED; and if networkControlledSyncTx is configured and set to on; or
\( 2> \) if networkControlledSyncTx is not configured; and for the concerned frequency syncTxThresh/C is configured; and the RSRP measurement of the reference cell, selected as defined in 5.8.6.3, for NR sidelink communication transmission is below the value of syncTxThreshIC:

3> transmit sidelink SSB on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication in accordance with 5.8.5.3 and TS 38.211 [16], including the transmission of SLSS as specified in 5.8.5.3 and transmission of MasterInformationBlockSidelink as specified in 5.8.9.4.3;

1> else:
\( 2> \) for the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, if syncTxThreshOoC is included in SidelinkPreconfigNR; and the UE is not directly synchronized to GNSS, and the UE has no selected SyncRef UE or the PSBCH-RSRP measurement result of the selected SyncRef UE is below the value of syncTxThreshOoC; or
\( 2> \) for the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, if the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source:

3> transmit sidelink SSB on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication in accordance with TS 38.211 [16], including the transmission of SLSS as specified in 5.8.5.3 and transmission of MasterInformationBlockSidelink as specified in 5.8.9.4.3;
5.8.5.3 Transmission of SLSS

The UE shall select the SLSSID and the slot in which to transmit SLSS as follows:
\( 1> \) if triggered by NR sidelink communication and in coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]; or

1> if triggered by NR sidelink communication, and out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication, and the concerned frequency is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message or included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12:
