12 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ ms ] from the end of reception of the network - \( > \) UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133[14], clause 8.6.3.
