\( 2> \) set the failureType as any value and set the failureType-v1610 as scg-IbtFailure;
\( 1> \) else if connected as an \( [\mathrm{AB} \)-node and the SCGFailurelnformationNR is initiated due to the reception of a BH
RLF indication on BAP entity from the SCG:
\( 2> \) set the failure Type as any value and set failureType-v1610 as bh-RLF.
\( 1> \) else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailurelnformationNR message due to beam failure of the PSCell while the SCG is deactivated:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as any value and set failureType-v 1610 as beamFailure
5.7.3.4 Setting the contents of MeasResultSCG-Failure

The UE shall set the contents of the MeasResultSCG-Failure as follows:
\( 1> \) for each MeasObjectNR configured on NR SCG for which a measld is configured and measurement results are available:
\( 2> \) include an entry in measResultPerMOList;
\( 2> \) if there is a measld configured with the MeasObjectNR and a reportConfig which has rsType set to ssb:
\( 3> \) set ssbFrequency to the value indicated by ssbFrequency as included in the MeasObjectNR;
\( 2> \) if there is a measld configured with the MeasObjectNR and a reportConfig which has rsType set to csi-rs:
\( 3> \) set refFreqCSI-RS to the value indicated by refFreqCSI-RS as included in the associated measurement object;
\( 2> \) if a serving cell is associated with the MeasObjectNR:
\( 3> \) set measResultServingCell to include the available quantities of the concerned cell and in accordance with the performance requirements in TS 38.133 [14];
\( 2> \) set the measResultNeighCellList to include the best measured cells, ordered such that the best cell is listed first, and based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and set its fields as follows;
\( 3> \) ordering the cells with sorting as follows:
\( 4> \) based on SS/PBCH block if SS/PBCH block measurement results are available and otherwise based on CSI-RS;

4 using RSRP if RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise using RSRQ if RSRQ measurement results are available, otherwise using SINR;
\( 3> \) for each neighbour cell included:
\( 4> \) include the optional fields that are available.
NOTE: The measured quantities are filtered by the L3 filter as configured in the mobility measurement configuration. The measurements are based on the time domain measurement resource restriction, if configured. Exclude-listed cells are not required to be reported.
\( 2> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7.:
5.7.3.5 Actions related to transmission of SCGFailureInformation message

The UE shall set the contents of the SCGFailurelnformation message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailurelnformation message due to T310 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the failure Type as 1310 -Expiry;
\( 1> \) else if the UE initiates transmission of the SCGFailurelnformation message due to T312 expiry:
