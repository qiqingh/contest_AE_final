\( 1> \) for each PC5 Relay RLC channel that is to be released due to configuration by sl-ConfigDedicatedNR:
\( 2> \) set the SL-RLC-ChannelConfig-PC5 included in the sl-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList-PC5 corresponding to the PC5 Relay RLC channel;
\( 1> \) for each PC5 Relay RLC channel that is to be established or modified due to receiving sl-ConfigDedicatedNR:
\( 2> \) set the SL-RLC-ChannelConfig-PC5 included in the sl-RLC-ChannelToAddModList-PC5, according to the received sl-RLC-ChannelConfig corresponding to the PC5 Relay RLC channel;

The UE shall submit the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message to lower layers for transmission.
5.8.9.1.3 Reception of an RRCReconfiguration Sidelink by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink:
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink includes the \( s \) l-ResetConfig:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink reset configuration procedure as specified in 5.8.9.1.10;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink includes the sirb-ConfigToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) for each SLRB-PC5-ConfigIndex value included in the sirb-ConfigToReleaseList that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration;

3> perform the sidelink DRB release procedure, according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
1> if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink includes the sirb-ConfigToAddModList:
\( 2> \) for each strb-PC5-ConfigIndex value included in the sirb-ConfigToAddModList that is not part of the current UE sidelink configuration:

3> if sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToAddList is included:
4> apply the SL-PQFI included in sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToAddList;
\( 3> \) perform the sidelink DRB addition procedure, according to clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
2 for each sirb-PC5-ConfigIndex value included in the sirb-ConfigToAddModList that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration:

3> if sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToAddList is included:
4> add the SL-PQFI included in sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToAddList to the corresponding sidelink DRB;
3> if sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToReleaseList is included:
4> remove the SL-PQFI included in sl-MappedQoS-FlowsToReleaseList from the corresponding sidelink DRB;

3> if the sidelink DRB release conditions as described in clause 5.8.9-1a.1.1 are met:
\( 4> \) perform the sidelink DRB release procedure according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1.2;
\( 3> \) else if the sidelink DRB modification conditions as described in clause 5.8.9.1a.2.1 are met:
\( 4> \) perform the sidelink DRB modification procedure according to clause 5.8.9.1a.2.2;
1> if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message includes the sl-MeasConfig:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink measurement configuration procedure as specified in 5.8.10;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message includes the sl-CSI-RS-Config:
2> apply the sidelink CSI-RS configuration;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message includes the \( s \) /-LatencyBoundCSI-Report:
