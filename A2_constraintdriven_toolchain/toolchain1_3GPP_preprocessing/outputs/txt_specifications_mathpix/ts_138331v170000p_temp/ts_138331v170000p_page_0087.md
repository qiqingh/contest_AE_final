\( 2> \) if the RLC bearer is associated with an DAPS bearer, or
\( 2> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured and the RLC bearer is associated with an SRB:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the RLC entity or entities for the target cell group in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
3> reconfigure the logical channel for the target cell group in accordance with the received macLogicalChannelConfig;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if reestablish \( R L C \) is received:
4> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];
\( 3> \) reconfigure the RLC entity or entities in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
\( 3> \) reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig;
NOTE 1: The network does not re-associate an already configured logical channel with another radio bearer. Hence servedRadioBearer or servedMBS-RadioBearer is not present in this case.

NOTE 2: In DAPS handover, the UE may perform RLC entity re-establishment (if reestablishRLC is set) for an RLC bearer associated with a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3].

1> else (a logical channel with the given logicalChannelldentity/LogicalChannelldentityExt is not configured within the same cell group, including the case when full configuration option is used):
\( 2> \) if the servedRadioBearer associates the logical channel with an SRB and ric-Config is not included:
3> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the default configuration defined in 9.2 for the corresponding SRB;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) establish an RLC entity in accordance with the received \( r l c \)-Config;
\( 2> \) if the servedRadioBearer associates the logical channel with an SRB and if mac-LogicalChannelConfig is not included:

3> configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to the default configuration defined in 9.2 for the corresponding SRB;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to the received macLogicalChannelConfig;
\( 2> \) associate this logical channel with the PDCP entity identified by servedRadioBearer or servedMBSRadioBearer.
5.3.5.5.5 MAC entity configuration

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if SCG MAC is not part of the current UE configuration (i.e. SCG establishment):
\( 2> \) create an SCG MAC entity;
\( 1> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 2> \) reconfigure the MAC main configuration for the target cell group in accordance with the received macCellGroupConfig excluding tag-ToReleaseList and tag-ToAddModList;

1> else:
