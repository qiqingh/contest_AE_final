5.7.5.2 Initiation

A UE initiates the procedure when there is a need inform the network about a failure detected by the UE. In particular, the UE initiates the procedure when the following condition is met:
\( 1> \) upon detecting failure for an RLC bearer, in accordance with 5.3.10.3;
\( 1> \) upon detecting DAPS handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.8.3;
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) initiate transmission of the Failurelnformation message as specified in 5.7.5.3;
5.7.5.3 Actions related to transmission of FailureInformation message

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if initiated to provide RLC failure information, set FailurelnfoRLC-Bearer as follows:
\( 2> \) set logicalChannelldentity to the logical channel identity of the failing RLC bearer;
\( 2> \) set cellGroupld to the cell group identity of the failing RLC bearer;
\( 2> \) set the failureType as NC-failure;
\( 1> \) if initiated to provide DAPS failure information, set FailureInfoDAPS as follows:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as daps-failure;
1> if used to inform the network about a failure for an MCG RLC bearer or DAPS failure information:
\( 2> \) submit the Failurelnformation message to lower layers for transmission via SRB1;
1> else if used to inform the network about a failure for an SCG RLC bearer:
\( 2> \) if SRB3 is configured;
\( 3> \) submit the Failurelnformation message to lower layers for transmission via SRB3;
\( 2> \) else;
\( 3> \) if the UE is in (NG)EN-DC:
\( 4> \) submit the Failurelnformation message via E-UTRA SRB1 embedded in E-UTRA RRC message ULInformationTransferMRDC as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
\( 3> \) else if the UE is in NR-DC:
\( 4> \) submit the Failurelnformation message via SRB1 embedded in NR RRC message ULInformationTransferMRDC as specified in clause 5.7.2a.3.
