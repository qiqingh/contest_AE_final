3> trigger the lower layers to initiate the measurement gap activation request using UL MAC CE as specified in TS 38.321 [6];
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
\( 1> \) if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or stop subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA and preConfigGapID is not activated:
\( 2> \) initiate the procedure to indicate stop.
NOTE 2: The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
\( 1> \) if preConfigGapID is activated:
\( 2> \) if a request from upper layers to transmit either a new preConfigGapID or to modify the current measGapConfig is received; or
\( 2> \) if a request from upper layers indicate that the current gap is not needed:
3> trigger the lower layers to deactivate the current active measurement gap as specified in TS 38.321 [6];
5.5.6.3 Actions related to transmission of LocationMeasurementIndication message

The UE shall set the contents of LocationMeasurementIndication message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of location related measurements:
\( 2> \) if the procedure is initiated for RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA:
3> set the measurementIndication to the eutra-RSTD according to the information received from upper layers;
\( 2> \) else if the procedure is initiated for positioning measurement towards NR:
3> set the measurementIndication to the \( n r \)-PRS-Measurement according to the information received from upper layers;
\( 1> \) else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of location related measurements:
\( 2> \) set the measurementIndication to the value release;
\( 1> \) if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:
\( 2> \) set the measurementIndication to the value eutra-FineTimingDetection;
\( 1> \) else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:
\( 2> \) set the measurementIndication to the value release;
1> submit the LocationMeasurementIndication message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
