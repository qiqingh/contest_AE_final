5.7.3a EUTRA SCG failure information
5.7.3a.1 General

Figure 5.7.3a.1-1: EUTRA SCG failure information

The purpose of this procedure is to inform NR MN about an SCG failure on E-UTRA SN the UE has experienced (e.g. SCG radio link failure, SCG change failure), as specified in TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.2.
5.7.3a. 2 Initiation

A UE initiates the procedure to report EUTRA SCG failures when neither NR MCG nor EUTRA SCG transmission is suspended and in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.2. Actions the UE shall perform upon initiating the procedure, other than related to the transmission of the SCGFailureInformationEUTRA message are specified in TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.2.
5.7.3a.3 Actions related to transmission of SCGFailurelnformationEUTRA message

The UE shall set the contents of the SCGFailureInformationEUTRA message as follows:
1> include failureType within failureReportSCG-EUTRA and set it to indicate the SCG failure in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.4;
\( 1> \) include and set measResultSCG-FailureMRDC in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.5;
\( 1> \) for each EUTRA frequency the UE is configured to measure by measConfig for which measurement results are available:
\( 2> \) set the measResultFreqListMRDC to include the best measured cells, ordered such that the best cell is listed first using RSRP to order if RSRP measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using RSRQ to order if RSRQ measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using SINR to order, and based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and for each cell that is included, include the optional fields that are available;

NOTE: Field measResultSCG-FailureMRDC is used to report available results for E-UTRAN frequencies the UE is configured to measure by E-UTRA RRC signalling.
\( 1> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7.:
The UE shall submit the SCGFailureInformationEUTRA message to lower layers for transmission.
