5.7.4.3a Setting the contents of OverheatingAssistance IE

The UE shall set the contents of OverheatingAssistance IE if initiated to provide overheating assistance indication for SCG in (NG)EN-DC according to clause 5.6.10.3 as specified in TS 36.331 [10]:

1> if the UE prefers to temporarily reduce the number of maximum secondary component carriers for SCG:
\( 2> \) include reducedMaxCCs in the OverheatingAssistance IE;
\( 2> \) set reducedCCsDL to the number of maximum SCells of the SCG the UE prefers to be temporarily configured in downlink;
\( 2> \) set reducedCCsUL to the number of maximum SCells of the SCG the UE prefers to be temporarily configured in uplink;
\( 1> \) if the UE prefers to temporarily reduce maximum aggregated bandwidth of FR1 for SCG:
\( 2> \) include reducedMaxBW-FRI in the OverheatingAssistance [E;
\( 2> \) set reducedBW-FR1-DL to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE prefers to be temporarily configured across all downlink carriers of FR1 of the SCG;
\( 2> \) set reducedBW-FRI-UL to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE prefers to be temporarily configured across all uplink carriers of FR1 of the SCG;
\( 1> \) if the UE prefers to temporarily reduce maximum aggregated bandwidth of FR2-1 for SCG:
\( 2> \) include reducedMaxBW-FR2 in the OverheatingAssistance IE;
\( 2> \) set reducedBW-FR2-DL to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE prefers to be temporarily configured across all downlink carriers of FR2-1 of the SCG;
