5.3.11 UE actions upon going to RRC_IDLE

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) reset MAC ;
\( 1> \) set the variable pendingRNA-Update to false, if that is set to true;
\( 1> \) if going to RRC_IDLE was triggered by reception of the RRCRelease message including a waitTime:
\( 2> \) if T302 is running:
\( 3> \) stop timer T302;
\( 2> \) start timer T302 with the value set to the waitTime;
\( 2> \) inform upper layers that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories ' 0 ' and ' 2 '.
1> else:
\( 2> \) if T302 is running:
3> stop timer T302;
\( 3> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
\( 1> \) if T390 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T390 for all access categories;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1> if the UE is leaving RRC_INACTIVE:
\( 2> \) if going to RRC_IDLE was not triggered by reception of the RRCRelease message:
\( 3> \) if stored, discard the cell reselection priority information provided by the cellReselectionPriorities;
\( 3> \) stop the timer T320, if running;
\( 1> \) stop all timers that are running except \( \mathrm{T} 302, \mathrm{~T} 320, \mathrm{~T} 325, \mathrm{~T} 330, \mathrm{~T} 331 \) and T 400 ;
\( 1> \) discard the UE [nactive AS context, if any;
\( 1> \) release the suspendConfig, if configured;
\( 1> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 1> \) for each measld, if the associated reportConfig has a reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
\( 2> \) for the associated reportConfigld:
\( 3> \) remove the entry with the matching reportConfigld from the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) if the associated measObjectld is only associated to a reportConfig with reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
\( 3> \) remove the entry with the matching measObjectld from the measObjectList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching measld from the measldList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 1> \) discard the \( K_{g N B} \) key, the \( S-K_{g N B} \) key, the \( S-K_{e N B} \) key, the \( K_{R R C e n c} \) key, the \( K_{R R C \text { int }} \) key, the \( K_{U P \text { int }} \) key and the Kupenc key, if any;
\( 1> \) release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity, the BAP entity, the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP for all established RBs, BH RLC channels, Uu Relay RLC channels, PC5 Relay channels and SRAP entity;
