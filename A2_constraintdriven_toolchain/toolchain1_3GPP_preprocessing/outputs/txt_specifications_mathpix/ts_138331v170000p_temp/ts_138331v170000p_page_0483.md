\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BWP-UplinkCommon field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
additionalRACH-ConfigCommon \\
List of feature or feature combination-specific RACH configurations, i.e. the RACH configurations configured in addition to the one configured by rach-ConfigCommon and by msgA-ConfigCommon. \\
Editor's note: Naming of this can be discussed further, e.g. to make it clear that this field can configure msgA-ConfigCommons also.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableRA-PrioritizationForSlicing \\
Indicates whether or not the random access prioritization for slicing should override the ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity. If value TRUE is configured, the UE should only apply the random access prioritization for slicing. If value FALSE is configured, the UE should only apply ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-ConfigCommon \\
Configuration of the cell specific PRACH and PUSCH resource parameters for transmission of MsgA in 2-step random access type procedure. The NW can configure msgAConfigCommon only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial BL BWP
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ConfigCommon \\
Cell specific parameters for the PUCCH of this BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pusch-ConfigCommon \\
Cell specific parameters for the PUSCH of this BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rach-ConfigCommon \\
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters which the UE uses for contention based and contention free random access as well as for contention based beam failure recovery in this BWP. The NW configures SSB-based RA (and hence RACH-ConfigCommon) only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-ld as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. The network configures rach-ConfigCommon, whenever it configures contention free random access (for reconfiguration with sync or for beam failure recovery).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rach-ConfigCommonlAB \\
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters for the IAB-MT. The IAB specific IAB RACH configuration is used by IAB-MT, if configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
useinterlacePUCCH-PUSCH \\
If the field is present, the UE uses uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for cell-specific PUSCH, e.g., PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant (see 38.213 clause 8.3 and 38.214 clause 6.1.2.2) and uses interlaced PUCCH Format 0 and 1 for cell-specific PUCCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline RAPrioSliceAl & The field is optionally present, Need M, if both parameters ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity and the random access prioritization for slicing are included, and the field is sent in system information. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline SpCellOnly2 & The field is optionally present, Need M, in the BWP-UplinkCommon of an SpCell. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline SpCellOnly 3 & The field is optionally present, Need M, in the BWP-UplinkCommon of an SpCell. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline

- BWP-UplinkDedicated

The IE BWP-UplinkDedicated is used to configure the dedicated (UE specific) parameters of an uplink BWP.
