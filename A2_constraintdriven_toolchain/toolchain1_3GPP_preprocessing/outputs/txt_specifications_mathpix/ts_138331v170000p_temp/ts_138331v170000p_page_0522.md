\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline ControlResourceSet field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cce-REG-MappingType \\
Mapping of Control Channel Elements (CCE) to Resource Element Groups (REG) (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
controlResourceSetid \\
Identifies the instance of the ControlResourceSet IE. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon (controlResourceSetZero) and is hence not used here in the ControlResourceSet IE. Other values identify CORESETs configured by dedicated signalling or in SIB1. The controlResourceSet/d is unique among the BWPs of a serving cell. \\
If the field controlResourceSet/d-v1610 is present, the UE shall ignore the controlResourceSet/d field (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
coresetPoolindex \\
The index of the CORESET pool for this CORESET as specified in TS 38.213 [13] (clauses 9 and 10) and TS 38.214 [19] (clauses 5.1 and 6.1). If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0 .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
duration \\
Contiguous time duration of the CORESET in number of symbols (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
followUnifiedTCIstate \\
When set to enabled, for PDCCH reception on this CORESET, the UE applies the "indicated" Rel-17 DL only or joint TCI as specified in TS 38.214 clause 5.1.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyDomainResources \\
Frequency domain resources for the CORESET. Each bit corresponds a group of 6 RBs, with grouping starting from the first RB group in the BWP. When at least one search space is configured with freqMonitorLocation-r16, only the first \( N_{\text {RBG }, \text { seto }}^{\text {size }} \) bits are valid (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). The first (left-most / most significant) bit corresponds to the first RB group in the BWP, and so on. A bit that is set to 1 indicates that this RB group belongs to the frequency domain resource of this CORESET. Bits corresponding to a group of RBs not fully contained in the bandwidth part within which the CORESET is configured are set to zero (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
interleaverSize \\
Interleaver-size (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID \\
PDCCH DMRS scrambling initialization (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.3.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellld configured for this serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
precoderGranularity \\
Precoder granularity in frequency domain (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rb-Offset \\
Indicates the RB level offset in units of RB from the first RB of the first 6RB group to the first RB of BWP (see 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reg-BundleSize \\
Resource Element Groups (REGs) can be bundled to create REG bundles. This parameter defines the size of such bundles (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
shiftindex \\
When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCell/dconfigured for this serving cell (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tci-PresentinDCI \\
This field indicates if TCI field is present or absent in DCI format 1_1. When the field is absent the UE considers the TCI to be absent/disabled. In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network sets this field to enabled for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_1 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tci-PresentDCl-1-2 \\
Configures the number of bits for "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format 1_2. When the field is absent the UE applies the value of 0 bit for the "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) (see TS 38.212, clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.214, clause 5.1.5). In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network configures this field for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_2 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList \\
A subset of the TCI states defined in pdsch-Config included in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the ControlResourceSet belong to. They are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS(s) in one RS Set (TCI-State) and the PDCCH DMRS ports (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.). The network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries.
