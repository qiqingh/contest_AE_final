uplinkTxSwitchingPeriodLocation
Indicates whether the location of UL Tx switching period is configured in this uplink carrier in case of inter-band UL CA, SUL, or (NG)EN-DC, as specified in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-3 [34].
In case of (NG)EN-DC, network always configures this field to TRUE for NR carrier (i.e. with (NG)EN-DC, the UL switching period always occurs on the NR carrier).
In case of inter-band UL CA or SUL, for dynamic uplink Tx switching between 2 bands with 2 uplink carriers or 3 uplink carriers as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15], network configures this field to TRUE for the uplink carrier(s) on one band and configures this field to FALSE for the uplink carrier(s) on the other band. This field is set to the same value for the carriers on the same band.
uplinkTxSwitchingCarrier
Indicates that the configured carrier is carrier1 or carrier2 for dynamic uplink Tx switching, as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-3 [34]. In case of (NG)EN-DC, network always configures the NR carrier as carrier 2.
In case of inter-band UL CA or SUL, for dynamic uplink Tx switching between 2 bands with 2 uplink carriers or 3 uplink carriers as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15], network configures the uplink carrier(s) on one band as carrier 1 and the uplink carrier(s) on the other band as carrier 2 . This field is set to the same value for the carriers on the same band.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline DormantBWP-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dormancyGroupWithinActiveTime \\
This field contains the ID of an SCell group for Dormancy within active time, to which this SCell belongs. The use of the Dormancy within active time SCell groups is specified in TS 38.213 [13].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dormancyGroupOutsideActiveTime \\
This field contains the ID of an SCell group for Dormancy outside active time, to which this SCell belongs. The use of the Dormancy outside active time SCell groups is specified in TS 38.213 [13].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dormantBWP-Id \\
This field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used as dormant BWP. If this field is configured, its value is different from defaultDownilikBWP-ld, and at least one of the withinActive TimeConfig and outsideActive TimeConfig should be configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id \\
This field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be activated when receiving a DCI indication for SCell dormancy outside active time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firs tWithinActive TimeBWP-Id \\
This field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be activated when receiving a DCI indication for SCell dormancy within active time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
outsideActiveTimeConfig \\
This field contains the configuration to be used for SCell dormancy outside active time, as specified in TS 38.213 [13]. The field can only be configured when the cell group the SCell belongs to is configured with dcp-Config.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
withinActiveTimeConfig \\
This field contains the configuration to be used for SCell dormancy within active time, as specified in TS 38.213 [13].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline GuardBand field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startCRB \\
Indicates the starting RB of the guard band.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofCRB \\
Indicates the length of the guard band in RBs. When set to 0 , zero-size guard band is used.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

NOTE 1: If the dedicated part of initial UL/DL BWP configuration is absent, the initial BWP can be used but with some limitations. For example, changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.
