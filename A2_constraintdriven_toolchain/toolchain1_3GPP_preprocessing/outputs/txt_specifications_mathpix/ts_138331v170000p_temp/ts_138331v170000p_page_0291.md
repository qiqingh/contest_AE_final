\( 2> \) apply the configured sidelink CSI report latency bound;
\( 1> \) if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink (i.e. sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure):
\( 2> \) continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message;
\( 2> \) set the content of the RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink message;
3> submit the RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink message to lower layers for transmission;
\( 1> \) else:
\( 2> \) set the content of the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message;
3> submit the RRCReconfiguration CompleteSidelink message to lower layers for transmission;
NOTE 1: When the same logical channel is configured with different RLC mode by another UE, the UE handles the case as sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure.
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink includes the sl-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList-PC5:
\( 2> \) for each SL-RLC-ChannellD value included in the sl-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList-PC5 that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration;

3> perform the PC5 Relay RLC channel release procedure, according to clause 5.8.9.7.1;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfigurationSidelink includes the sl-RLC-ChannelToAddModList-PC5:
\( 2> \) for each sl-RLC-ChannellD-PC5 value included in the sl-RLC-ChannelToAddModList-PC5 that is not part of the current UE sidelink configuration:
\( 3> \) perform the sidelink RLC channle addition procedure, according to clause 5.8.9.7.2;
\( 2> \) for each sl-RLC-ChannellD-PC5 value included in the sl-RLC-ChannelToAddModList-PC5 that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration:

3> perform the PC5 Relay RLC channel modification procedure according to clause 5.8.9.7.2;

5.8.9.1.8 Reception of an RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink:
1> stop timer T400 for the destination, if running;
\( 1> \) continue using the configuration used prior to corresponding RRCReconfigurationSidelink message;
1> if UE is in RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication procedure, as specified in 5.8.3.3 or clause 5.10.15 in TS 36.331 [10];
5.8.9.1.9 Reception of an RRCReconfiguration Complete Sidelink by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink:
