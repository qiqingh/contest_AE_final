Editor's Note 1: the content of assistance information for determining sidelink DRX configuration, is FFS.
Editor's Note 2: FFS on inactivity timer to be included in assistance information from RX UE to TX UE.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SidelinkUEinformationNR field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-RxDRX-ReportList \\
Indicates the reported DRX configuration received from peer UE and the reported QoS profile for which service UE is interested to the network for NR sidelink unicast communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-RxinterestedFreqList \\
Indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to receive NR sidelink communication. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-Sourceldentity-RemoteUE \\
This field is used to indicate the Source Layer-2 ID to be used to establish PC5 link with L2 U2N Relay UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-TxResourceReq \\
Parameters to request the transmission resources for NR sidelink communication to the network in the Sidelink UE Information report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ue-Type \\
Indicates the UE is acting as U2N Relay UE or U2N Remote UE.
