\( 4> \) include reducedMax \( B W-F R] \) in the Max \( B W \)-Preference \( [E \);
\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W-D L \) to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE desires to have configured across all downlink carriers of FR1 in the cell group;
\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W \) - \( U L \) to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE desires to have configured across all uplink carriers of FR1 in the cell group;
\( 3> \) if the UE prefers to reduce the maximum aggregated band width of FR2-1:

\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W-D L \) to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE desires to have configured across all downlink carriers of FR2-1 in the cell group;
\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W \) - \( U L \) to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE desires to have configured across all uplink carriers of FR2-1 in the cell group;
\( 2> \) else (if the UE has no preference on the maximum aggregated band width for the cell group):
\( 3> \) do not include reducedMax \( B W-F R] \) and reducedMax \( B W-F R 2 \) in the \( M a x B W \)-Preference \( [\mathrm{E} \);
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide maxBW-PreferenceFR2-2 of a cell group for power saving according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) include maxBW-PreferenceFR2-2 in the UEAssistanceInformation message;
\( 3> \) if the UE prefers to reduce the maximum aggregated band width of FR2-2:
\( 4> \) include reducedMaxBW-FR2-2 in the MaxBW-PreferenceFR2-2 [E;
\( 4> \) set reduced \( B W-F R 2-2-D L \) to the maximum aggregated bandwidth the UE desires to have configured across all downlink carriers of FR2-2 in the cell group;

\( 3> \) do not include reducedMaxBW-FR2-2 in the MaxBW-PreferenceFR2-2 [E;
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide maxCC-Preference of a cell group for power saving according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) include maxCC-Preference in the UEAssistancelnformation message;
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers for the cell group:
\( 3> \) include reducedMaxCCs in the MaxCC-Preference [E;
\( 3> \) set reducedCCsDL to the number of maximum SCells the UE desires to have configured in downlink in the cell group;

\( 2> \) else (if the UE has no preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers for the cell group):
\( 3> \) do not include reducedMaxCCs in the MaxCC-Preference [E;
NOTE 3: The UE can implicitly indicate a preference for NR SCG release by reporting the maximum aggregated band width preference for power saving of the cell group, if configured, as zero for both FR1 and FR2, and by reporting the maximum number of secondary component carriers for power saving of the cell group, if configured, as zero for both uplink and downlink.
