\( 4> \) start or restart the prohibit timer (if exists) associated with the concerned UE assistance information with the timer value set to the value in corresponding configuration;
\( 3> \) if SIB12 is provided by the target PCell; and the UE initiated transmission of a SidelinkUEInformationNR message indicating a change of NR sidelink communication related parameters relevant in target PCell (i.e. change of sl-RxInterestedFreqList or sl-TxResourceReqList) during the last 1 second preceding reception of the RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync in spCellConfig of an MCG; or
\( 3> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message is applied due to a conditional reconfiguration execution and the UE is capable of NR sidelink communication and SIB12 is provided by the target PCell, and the UE has initiated transmission of a SidelinkUEInformationNR message since it was configured to do so in accordance with 5.8.3.2:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the SidelinkUEInformationNR message in accordance with 5.8.3.3;
\( 2> \) the procedure ends.
NOTE 3: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SIBI if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located.

NOTE 4: The UE sets the content of UEAssistancelnformation according to latest configuration (ie the configuration after applying the RRCReconfiguration message) and latest UE preference. The UE may include more than the concerned UE assistance information within the UEAssistanceInformation according to 5.7.4.2. Therefore, the content of UEAssistancelnformation message might not be the same as the content of the previous UEAssistancelnformation message.
5.3.5.4 Secondary cell group release

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) as a result of SCG release triggered by E-UTRA (i.e (NG)EN-DC case) or NR (i.e. NR-DC case):
\( 2> \) reset SCG MAC, if configured;
\( 2> \) for each RLC bearer that is part of the SCG configuration:
\( 3> \) perform RLC bearer release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.5.3;
\( 2> \) for each BH RLC channel that is part of the SCG configuration:
\( 3> \) perform BH RLC channel release procedure as specified in 5.3 .5 .5 .10 ;
\( 2> \) release the SCG configuration;
2 if CPC was configured,
\( 3> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 2> \) stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
\( 2> \) stop timer T312 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
\( 2> \) stop timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell, if running.
NOTE: Release of cell group means only release of the lower layer configuration of the cell group but the RadioBearerConfig may not be released.
5.3.5.5 Cell Group configuration
5.3.5.5.1 General

The network configures the UE with Master Cell Group (MCG), and zero or one Secondary Cell Group (SCG). In (NG)EN-DC, the MCG is configured as specified in TS 36.331 [10], and for NE-DC, the SCG is configured as
