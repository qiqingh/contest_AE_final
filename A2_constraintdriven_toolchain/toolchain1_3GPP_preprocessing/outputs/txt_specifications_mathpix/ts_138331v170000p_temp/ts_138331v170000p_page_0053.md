5.2.2.4.4 Actions upon reception of SIB3

No UE requirements related to the contents of this \( S I B 3 \) apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the concerned system information, and/ or within the corresponding field descriptions.
5.2.2.4.5 Actions upon reception of SIB4

Upon receiving \( S I B 4 \) the UE shall:
1> if in RRC_IDLE, or in RRC_INACTIVE or in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
\( 2> \) for each entry in the interFreqCarrierFreqList:
3> if the UE is not a RedCap UE or if redcapAccessReject is absent:
4> select the first frequency band in the frequencyBandList, and frequencyBandListSUL, if present, which the UE supports and for which the UE supports at least one of the additionalSpectrumEmission values in NR-NS-PmaxList, if present:

4> if, the frequency band selected by the UE in frequencyBandList to represent a non-serving NR carrier frequency is not a downlink only band:

5> if, for the selected frequency band, the UE supports at least one additionalSpectrumEmission in the NR-NS-PmaxList within the frequencyBandList:
