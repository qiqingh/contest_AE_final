5.3.5.5.11 BH RLC channel addition/modification

For each BH-RLC-ChannelConfig received in the bh-RLC-ChannelToAddModList IE the IAB-node shall:
\( 1> \) if the current configuration contains a BH RLC Channel with the received \( b h-R L C \)-ChannellD within the same cell group:
\( 2> \) if reestablishRLC is received:
3> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];
\( 2> \) reconfigure the RLC entity or entities in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
\( 2> \) reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig;
\( 1> \) else (a backhaul logical channel with the given \( B H-R L C \)-ChannellD was not configured before within the same cell group):
\( 2> \) establish an RLC entity in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
\( 2> \) configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig-
5.3.5.5.12 Uu Relay RLC channel release

The L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
1> for each Uu-Relay-RLC-ChannellD value included in the uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList that is part of the current configuration within the same cell group (LCH release):
\( 2> \) release the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3;
\( 2> \) release the corresponding logical channel.
5.3.5.5.13 Uu Relay RLC channel addition/modification

For each Uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelConfig received in the Uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelToAddModList IE the L2 U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the current configuration contains a Uu Relay RLC channel with the received \( u u- \) Relay-RLC-ChannellD within the same cell group:
\( 2> \) if reestablishRLC is received:
3> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];
\( 2> \) reconfigure the RLC entity in accordance with the received \( r / c \)-Config;
\( 2> \) reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig;
1> else (a logical channel with the given Uu-Relay-RLC-ChannellD was not configured before within the same cell group):
\( 2> \) establish an RLC entity in accordance with the received rlc-Config;
\( 2> \) configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to the received mac-LogicalChannelConfig-
5.3.5.6 Radio Bearer configuration
5.3.5.6.1 General
