\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
radioBearerConfig2 \\
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. This field can only be used if the UE supports NR-DC or NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg-State \\
Indicates that the SCG is in deactivated state. This field is not used in an RRCReconfiguration message received within mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup, E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration or E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume message. The field is absent if CPA or CPC is configured for the UE, or if the RRCReconfiguration message is contained in CondRRCReconfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-L2RelayUEConfig \\
Contains L2 U2N relay operation related configurations used by L2 U2N Relay UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-L2RemoteUEConfig \\
Contains L2 U2N relay operation related configurations used by L2 U2N Remote UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
secondaryCellGroup \\
Configuration of secondary cell group ((NG)EN-DC or NR-DC).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sk-Counter \\
A counter used upon initial configuration of S-Kgnb or S-Kenb, as well as upon refresh of S-Kgnb or S-Kenb. This field is always included either upon initial configuration of an NR SCG or upon configuration of the first RB with keyToUse set to secondary, whichever happens first. This field is absent if there is neither any NR SCG nor any RB with keyToUse set to secondary.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-ConfigDedicatedNR \\
This field is used to provide the dedicated configurations for NR sidelink communication/discovery.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info \\
This field includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration can only includes sidelink related fields for V2X sidelink communication, i.e. si-V2X-ConfigDedicated, si-V2X-SPS-Config, measConfig and/or otherConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TimeOffsetEUTRA \\
This field indicates the possible time offset to (de)activation of V2X sidelink transmission after receiving DCI format 3_1 used for scheduling V2X sidelink communication. Value msOdpt75 corresponds to \( 0.75 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~ms} 1 \) corresponds to 1 ms and so on. The network includes this field only when si-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
targetCellSMTC-SCG \\
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell addition and SN change. When UE receives this field, UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of NR PCell for PSCell addition and PSCell change for the case of no reconfiguration with sync of MCG, and UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of target NR PCell for the case of reconfiguration with sync of MCG. If both this field and the smtc in secondaryCellGroup → SpCellConfig \( -> \) reconfigurationWithSync are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t316 \\
Indicates the value for timer T316 as described in clause 7.1 . Value \( m s 50 \) corresponds to 50 ms , value \( m s 100 \) corresponds to 100 ms and so on. This field can be configured only if the UE is configured with split SRB1 or SRB3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ul-GapFR2-Config-r17 \\
Indicates the FR2 UL gap configuration to UE. In EN-DC and NGEN-DC, the SN decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern. In NE-DC, the MN decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern. In NR-DC without FR2-FR2 band combination, the network entity which configures FR2 bands to UE decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern.
\end{tabular} \\
