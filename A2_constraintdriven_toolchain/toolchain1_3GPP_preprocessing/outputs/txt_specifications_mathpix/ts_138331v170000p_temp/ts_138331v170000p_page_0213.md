\( 5> \) set the servCellldentity to indicate global cell identity of the last logged cell that the UE was camping on;
\( 5> \) set the measResultServingCell to include the quantities of the last logged cell the UE was camping on;

\( 4> \) set the measResultServingCell to include the quantities of the cell the UE is camping on;
\( 3> \) if available, set the measResultNeighCells, in order of decreasing ranking-criterion as used for cell reselection, to include measurements of neighbouring cell that became available during the last logging interval and according to the following:

4 - include measurement results for at most 6 neighbouring cells on the NR serving frequency and for at most 3 cells per NR neighbouring frequency and for the NR neighbouring frequencies in accordance with the following:
\( 5> \) if interFreqTargetInfo is included in VarLogMeasConfig:
\( 6> \) if earlyMeasIndication is included in VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 7> \) include measurement results for NR neighbouring frequencies that are included in both interFreqTargetInfo and either in measIdleCarrierListNR or SIB4;
\( 6> \) else:
\( 7> \) include measurement results for NR neighbouring frequencies that are included in both interFreqTargetInfo and SIB4;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) if earlyMeasIndication is included in VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 7> \) include measurement results for NR neighbouring frequencies that are included in measIdleCarrierListNR or SIB4;
\( 6> \) else:
\( 7> \) include measurement results for NR neighbouring frequencies that are included in SIB4;
\( 4> \) include measurement results for at most 3 neighbours per inter-RAT frequency in accordance with the following:
\( 5> \) if earlyMeasIndication is included in VarLogMeasConfig:
\( 6> \) include measurement results for inter-RAT neighbouring frequencies that are included in measIdleCarrierListEUTRA or SIB5;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) include measurement results for inter-RAT frequencies that are included in SIB5;
4 for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are available;
NOTE 1: The UE includes the latest results of the available measurements as used for cell reselection evaluation in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, which are performed in accordance with the performance requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [14].

NOTE 2: For logging the measurements on frequencies (indicated in measldleCarrierListNR/ measIdleCarrierListEUTRA) in the logged measurement, the qualityThreshold in measIdleConfig should not be applied, and how the UE logs the measurements on the frequencies is left to the UE implementation.
