\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RateMatchPattern field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bitmaps \\
Indicates rate matching pattern by a pair of bitmaps resourceBlocks and symbolsinResourceBlock to define the rate match pattern within one or two slots, and a third bitmap periodicityAndPattern to define the repetition pattern with which the pattern defined by the above bitmap pair occurs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
controlResourceSet \\
This ControlResourceSet is used as a PDSCH rate matching pattern, i.e., PDSCH reception rate matches around it. In frequency domain, the resource is determined by the frequency domain resource of the CORESET with the corresponding CORESET ID. Time domain resource is determined by the parameters of the associated search space of the CORESET. \\
If the field controlResourceSet/d-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the controlResourceSet/d (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityAndPattern \\
A time domain repetition pattern at which the pattern defined by symbolsinResourceBlock and resourceBlocks recurs. This slot pattern repeats itself continuously. Absence of this field indicates the value \( n 1 \) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourceBlocks \\
A resource block level bitmap in the frequency domain. A bit in the bitmap set to 1 indicates that the UE shall apply rate matching in the corresponding resource block in accordance with the symbolsinResourceBlock bitmap. If used as cell-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "common resource blocks (CRB)". If used as BWP-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "physical resource blocks" inside the BWP. The first/ leftmost bit corresponds to resource block 0 , and so on (see TS 38.214[19], clause 5.1.4.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
subcarrierSpacing \\
The SubcarrierSpacing for this resource pattern. If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS of the associated BWP. The value kHz 15 corresponds to \( \mu=0 \), the value kHz 30 corresponds to \( \mu=1 \), and so on. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1): \\
FR1: 15,30 or 60 kHz \\
FR2-1: 60 or 120 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
symbolsinResourceBlock \\
A symbol level bitmap in time domain. It indicates with a bit set to true that the UE shall rate match around the corresponding symbol. This pattern recurs (in time domain) with the configured periodicityAndPattern (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). \\
For oneSlot, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the slot and the last two bits within the bitstring are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the 14 bits represent the symbols within the slot. \\
For twoSlots, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 12 bits represent the symbols in the second slot and the last four bits within the bit string are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the first 14 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 14 bits represent the symbols in the second slot. For the bits representing symbols in a slot, the most significant bit of the bit string represents the first symbol in the slot and the second most significant bit represents the second symbol in the slot and so on.
\end{tabular} \\

\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline CellLevel & The field is mandatory present if the RateMatchPattern is defined on cell level. The field is absent when the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level. If the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level, the UE applies the SCS of the BWP. \\
\hline
