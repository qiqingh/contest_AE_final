\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrdc-PC-mode-FR2 \\
Indicates the uplink power sharing mode that the UE uses in NR-DC FR2 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.6).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
overheatingAssistanceSCG \\
Contains the UE's preference on reduced configuration for NR SCG to address overheating. This field is only used in (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxEUTRA \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the E-UTRA cell group (see TS 36.104 [33]). This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxNR-FR1 \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1) (see TS 38.104 [12]). The field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxUE-FR1 \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxNR-FR1-MCG \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 1 (FR1) (see TS 38.104 [12]) the UE can use in NR MCG. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxNR-FR2-SCG \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2) (see TS 38.104 [12]) the UE can use in NR SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxUE-FR2 \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-maxNR-FR2-MCG \\
Indicates the maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the NR cell group across all serving cells in frequency range 2 (FR2) (see TS 38.104 [12]) the UE can use in NR MCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG \\
Indicates the maximum value of the reference number of cells for PDCCH blind detection allowed to be configured for the SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-infoMCG \\
Power headroom information in MCG that is needed in the reception of PHR MAC CE in SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-SupplementaryUplink \\
Power headroom information for supplementary uplink. For UE in (NG)EN-DC, this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-Type1or3 \\
Type of power headroom for a serving cell in MCG (PCell and activated SCells). type1 refers to type 1 power headroom, type3 refers to type 3 power headroom. (See TS 38.321 [3]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-Uplink \\
Power headroom information for uplink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerCoordination-FR1 \\
Indicates the maximum power that the UE can use in FR1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerCoordination-FR2 \\
Indicates the maximum power that the UE can use in frequency range 2 (FR2). This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scgFailureinfo \\
Contains SCG failure type and measurement results. In case the sender has no measurement results available, the sender may include one empty entry (i.e. without any optional fields present) in measResultPerMOList. This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg-RB-Config \\
Contains all of the fields in the IE RadioBearerConfig used in SN, used to allow the target SN to use delta configuration to the UE, e.g. during SN change. The field is signalled upon change of SN unless MN uses full configuration option. Otherwise, the field is absent.
