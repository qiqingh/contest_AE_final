\( 1> \) if the threshold conditions specified in this clause were not met:
\( 2> \) if threshHighRelay is not configured; or the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is below threshHighRelay by hystMaxRelay if configured; and
\( 2> \) if threshLowRelay is not configured; or the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is above threshLowRelay by hystMinRelay if configured:
\( 3> \) consider the threshold conditions to be met (entry);
1> else:
2 if the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is above threshHighRelay if configured; or
\( 2> \) if the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is below threshLowRelay if configured;
\( 3> \) consider the threshold conditions not to be met (leave);
5.8.15 NR sidelink U2N Remote UE operation
5.8.15.1 General

This procedure is used by a UE supporting NR sidelink U2N Remote UE operationconfigured by upper layers to receive/ transmit NR sidelink discovery message to evaluate AS layer conditions.
5.8.15.2 NR Sidelink U2N Remote UE threshold conditions

A UE capable of NR sidelink U2N Remote UE operation shall:
\( 1> \) if the threshold conditions specified in this clause were not met:
\( 2> \) if threshHighRemote is not configured; or the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is below threshHighRemote by hystMaxRemote if configured, or
\( 2> \) if the UE has no suitable cell:
\( 3> \) consider the threshold conditions to be met (entry);
1> else:
\( 2> \) if the RSRP measurement of the PCell, or the cell on which the UE camps, is above threshHighRemote if configured:
\( 3> \) consider the threshold conditions not to be met (leave);
5.8.15.3 Selection and reselection of NR sidelink U2N Relay UE

A UE capable of NR sidelink U2N Remote UE operation that is configured by upper layers to search for a NR sidelink U2N Relay UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE has no suitable cell; or
1> if the RSRP measurement of the cell on which the UE camps (for L2 and L3 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE)/ the PCell (for L3 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED) is below threshHighRemote within sl-remoteUE-Config:

2 if the UE does not have a selected NR sidelink U2N Relay UE; or
\( 2> \) if the UE has a selected NR sidelink U2N Relay UE, and SL-RSRP of the currently selected NR sidelink U2N Relay UE is available and is below sl-RSRP-Thresh; or
