\( 2> \) configure the parameters to SRAP entity in accordance with the \( s l \)-SRAP-Config-Relay;
\( 1> \) for each sl-L2Identity-Remote value included in the sl-RemoteUE-ToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration (L2 U2N Remote UE modification):
\( 2> \) modify the configuration in accordance with the \( s l \)-SRAP-Config-Relay;
5.3.5.16 L2 U2N Remote UE configuration
5.3.5.16.1 General

The network configures the L2 U2N Remote UE with relay operation related configurations, e.g. SRAP configuration.
The UE performs the following actions:
\( 1> \) if the \( s \) l-L2RemoteUEConfig contains the \( s \) l-SRAP-Config-Remote:
\( 2> \) configure the parameters to SRAP entity in accordance with the \( s l \)-SRAP-Config-Remote;
\( 1> \) if the \( s \)-L2RemoteUEConfig contains the \( s \)-ServingCellInfo:
\( 2> \) use the value of the sl-PhysCellld as the physical cell identity of the PCell;
\( 2> \) use the value of the sl-UEIdentityRemote as the C-RNTI in the PCell.
5.3.6 Counter check
5.3.6.1 General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure

The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by the network.

NOTE: The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a 'man in the middle').
5.3.6.2 Initiation

The network initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
NOTE: The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3 Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE

Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1> for each DRB that is established:
\( 2> \) if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
