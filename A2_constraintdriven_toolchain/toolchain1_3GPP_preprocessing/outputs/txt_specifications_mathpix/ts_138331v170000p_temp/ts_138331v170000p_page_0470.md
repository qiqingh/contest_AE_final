\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BeamFailureRecoveryConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamFailureRecoveryTimer \\
Timer for beam failure recovery timer. Upon expiration of the timer the UE does not use CFRA for BFR. Value in ms. Value \( m s 10 \) corresponds to 10 ms , value ms 20 corresponds to 20 ms , and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateBeamRSList, candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 \\
Set of reference signals (CSI-RS and/or SSB) identifying the candidate beams for recovery and the associated RA parameters. This set includes all elements of candidateBeamRSList (without suffix) and all elements of candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610. The UE maintains candidateBeamRSList and candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 separately: Receiving candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 set to release releases only the entries that were configured by candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610, and receiving candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 set to setup replaces only the entries that were configured by candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 with the newly signalled entries. The network configures these reference signals to be within the linked DL BWP (i.e., within the DL BWP with the same bwp-ld) of the UL BWP in which the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig is provided.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msg1-SubcarrierSpacing \\
Subcarrier spacing for contention free beam failure recovery (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15 or 30 kHz \\
FR2-1: 60 or 120 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rsrp-ThresholdSSB \\
L1-RSRP threshold used for determining whether a candidate beam may be used by the UE to attempt contention free random access to recover from beam failure (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-prioritization \\
Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure for BFR (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-PrioritizationTwoStep \\
Parameters which apply for prioritized 2-step random access procedure for BFR (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-ssb-OccasionMaskindex \\
Explicitly signalled PRACH Mask Index for RA Resource selection in TS 38.321 [3]. The mask is valid for all SSB resources.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rach-ConfigBFR \\
Configuration of random access parameters for BFR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
recoverySearchSpaceld \\
Search space to use for BFR RAR. The network configures this search space to be within the linked DL BWP (i.e., within the DL BWP with the same bwp-ld) of the UL BWP in which the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig is provided. The CORESET associated with the recovery search space cannot be associated with another search space. Network always configures the UE with a value for this field when contention free random access resources for BFR are configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rootSequenceIndex-BFR \\
PRACH root sequence index (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1) for beam failure recovery.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
spCell-BFR-CBRA \\
Indicates that UE is configured to send BFR MAC CE for SpCell BFR as specified in TS38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-perRACH-Occasion \\
Number of SSBs per RACH occasion for CF-BFR, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
