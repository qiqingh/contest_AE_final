- Network controlled mobility within NR, to/from E-UTRA, and to UTRA-FDD;
- The UE:
- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5), if configured;
- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
- Provides channel quality and feedback information;
- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
- Acquires system information;
- Performs immediate MDT measurement together with available location reporting;
- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.
