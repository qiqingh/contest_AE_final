ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)
5.8.10.3 Performing NR sidelink measurements
5.8.10.3.1 General

A UE shall derive NR sidelink measurement results by measuring one or multiple DMRS associated per PC5-RRC connection as configured by the peer UE associated, as described in 5.8.10.3.2. For all NR sidelink measurement results the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in clause 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria and measurement reporting. In this release, only NR sidelink RSRP can be configured as trigger quantity and reporting quantity.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-MeasId included in the sl-MeasIdList within VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) if the \( s \) /-MeasObject is associated to NR sidelink and the \( s l \)-RS-Type is set to dmrs:
\( 3> \) derive the layer 3 filtered NR sidelink measurement result based on DMRS for the trigger quantity and each measurement quantity indicated in \( s \)-ReportQuantity using parameters from the associated \( s \) MeasObject, as described in 5.8.10.3.2.
\( 2> \) perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in 5.8.10.4.
5.8.10.3.2 Derivation of NR sidelink measurement results

The UE may be configured by the peer UE associated to derive NR sidelink RSRP measurement results per PC5-RRC connection associated to the NR sidelink measurement objects based on parameters configured in the sl-MeasObject and in the \( s \)-ReportConfig.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each NR sidelink measurement quantity to be derived based on NR sidelink DMRS:
\( 2> \) derive the corresponding measurement of NR sidelink frequency indicated quantity based on DMRS as described in TS 38.215 [9] in the concerned s/-MeasObject;
\( 2> \) apply layer 3 filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;
5.8.10.4 Sidelink measurement report triggering
5.8.10.4.1 General

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( s \) /-MeasId included in the sl-MeasIdList within VarMeasConfigSL:
\( 2> \) if the \( s l \)-ReportType is set to \( s l \)-EventTriggered and if the entry condition applicable for this event, i.e. the event corresponding with the \( s \)-Eventld of the corresponding \( s \)-ReportConfig within VarMeasConfigSL, is fulfilled for NR sidelink frequency for all NR sidelink measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during \( s \) TimeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarMeasConfigSL, while the VarMeasReportListSL does not include a NR sidelink measurement reporting entry for this sl-Measld (a first NR sidelink frequency triggers the event):
\( 3> \) include a NR sidelink measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportListSL for this s/MeasId;
3> set the \( s i \)-NumberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this \( s i \)-MeasId to 0;
3> include the concerned NR sidelink frequency in the \( s \) /-FrequencyTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-Measld;
\( 3> \) initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.8.10.5;
\( 2> \) else if the \( s \)-ReportType is set to sl-EventTriggered and if the entry condition applicable for this event, i.e. the event corresponding with the \( s \)-Eventld of the corresponding sl-ReportConfig within VarMeasConfigSL, is fulfilled for NR sidelink frequency not included in the sl-FrequencyTriggeredList for all NR sidelink
