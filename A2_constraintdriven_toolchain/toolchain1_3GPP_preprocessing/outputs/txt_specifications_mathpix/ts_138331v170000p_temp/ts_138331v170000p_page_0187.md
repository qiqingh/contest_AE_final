3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
\( 2> \) else if the reportType is set to cli-EventTriggered and if the leaving condition applicable for this event is fulfilled for one or more of the CLI measurement resources included in the cli-TriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during timeToTrigger defined within the VarMeasConfig for this event:
\( 3> \) remove the concerned CLI measurement resource(s) in the cli-TriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;

3> if reportOnLeave is set to true for the corresponding reporting configuration:
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
3> if the cli-TriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId is empty:
4> remove the measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
4> stop the periodical reporting timer for this measid, if running;
\( 2> \) if reportType is set to cli-Periodical and if a (first) measurement result is available:
\( 3> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
3> set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId to 0;
\( 3> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5, immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for at least one CLI measurement resource;
\( 2> \) if reportType is set to \( r x T x P \) eriodical and if a (first) measurement result is available:
\( 3> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
3> set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId to 0;
\( 3> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
\( 2> \) upon expiry of the periodical reporting timer for this measId:
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5.
\( 2> \) if the corresponding reportConfig includes a reportType is set to reportSFTD:
\( 3> \) if the corresponding measObject concerns NR:
4> if the drx-SFTD-NeighMeas is included:
\( 5> \) if the quantity to be reported becomes available for each requested pair of PCell and NR cell:
\( 6> \) stop timer T322;
\( 6> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
4) else
\( 5> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5, immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for each requested pair of PCell and NR cell or the maximal measurement reporting delay as specified in TS 38.133 [14];

3> else if the corresponding measObject concerns E-UTRA:
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5, immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the pair of PCell and E-UTRA PSCell or the maximal measurement reporting delay as specified in TS 38.133 [14];
