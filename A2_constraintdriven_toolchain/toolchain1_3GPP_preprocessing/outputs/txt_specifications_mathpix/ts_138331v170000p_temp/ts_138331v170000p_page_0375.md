\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RRCResume-IEs field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
idieModeMeasurementReq \\
This field indicates that the UE shall report the idle/inactive measurements, if available, to the network in the RRCResumeComplete message
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
masterCellGroup \\
Configuration of the master cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup \\
Includes an RRC message for SCG configuration in NR-DC or NE-DC. \\
For NR-DC (nr-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup contains the RRCReconfiguration message as generated (entirely) by SN gNB. In this version of the specification, the RRC message can only include fields secondaryCellGroup (with at least reconfigurationWithSync), otherConfig and measConfig. \\
For NE-DC (eutra-SCG), mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRC message only include the field scg-Configuration with at least mobilityControllnfoSCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForGapsConfigNR \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap requirement information of NR target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForNCSG-ConfigEUTRA \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of E-UTRA target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and \\
RRCResume Complete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForNCSG-ConfigNR \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of NR target bands in the RRCReconfigurationComplete and RRCResumeComplete message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
radioBearerConfig \\
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
radioBearerConfig2 \\
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. This field can only be used if the UE supports NR-DC or NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
restoreMCG-SCells \\
Indicates that the UE shall restore the MCG SCells from the UE Inactive AS Context, if stored.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
restoreSCG \\
Indicates that the UE shall restore the SCG configurations from the UE Inactive AS Context, if stored.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg-State \\
Indicates that the SCG is in deactivated state.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sk-Counter \\
A counter used to derive S-KgnB or S-KenB based on the newly derived \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gnB}} \) during RRC Resume. The field is only included when there is one or more RB with keyToUse set to secondary or mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup is included.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-ConfigDedicatedNR \\
This field is used to provide the dedicated configurations for NR sidelink communication/discovery used by L2 U2N Remote UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-L2RemoteUEConfig \\
Contains L2 U2N relay operation related configurations used by L2 U2N Remote UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Conditional Presence } & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Explanation } \\
\hline L2RemoteUE & The field is mandatory present for L2 U2N Remote UE, need M; otherwise it is absent. \\
\hline RestoreSCG & The field is mandatory present if restoreSCG is included. It is optionally present, Need M, otherwise. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- \( \quad \) RRCResumeComplete

The RRCResumeComplete message is used to confirm the successful completion of an RRC connection resumption.
