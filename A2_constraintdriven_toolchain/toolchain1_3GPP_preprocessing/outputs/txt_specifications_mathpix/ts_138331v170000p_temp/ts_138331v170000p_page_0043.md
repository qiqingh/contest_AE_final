\( 1> \) if the UE is configured with an RRC_IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period and the systemInfoModification-eDRX bit of Short Message is set:
\( 2> \) apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2 .2 .3 from the start of the next eDRX acquisition period boundary.
5.2.2.3 Acquisition of System Information
5.2.2.3.1 Acquisition of MIB and SIB1

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
\( 2> \) acquire the MIB, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 2> \) if the UE is unable to acquire the MIB;
\( 3> \) perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and pagingSearchSpace and has received an indication about change of system information; or
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIBI and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1, and, the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, siBroadcastStatus for the required SIB(s) or posSI-BroadcastStatus for the required posSIB(s) is set to notbroadcasting in acquired SIBI in current modification period; or

1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
\( 2> \) if ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13]) and if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE:
\( 3> \) acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 3> \) if the UE is unable to acquire the SIBI:
\( 4> \) perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
\( 2> \) else if SIBI acquisition is required for the UE and ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIBI is not scheduled in the cell:
\( 3> \) perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
