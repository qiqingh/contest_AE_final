5.5.5.2 Reporting of beam measurement information

For beam measurement information to be included in a measurement report the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if reportType is set to eventTriggered:
\( 2> \) consider the trigger quantity as the sorting quantity if available, otherwise RSRP as sorting quantity if available, otherwise RSRQ as sorting quantity if available, otherwise SINR as sorting quantity;
\( 1> \) if reportType is set to periodical:
\( 2> \) if a single reporting quantity is set to true in reportQuantityRS-Indexes;
\( 3> \) consider the configured single quantity as the sorting quantity;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if rsrp is set to true;
\( 4> \) consider RSRP as the sorting quantity;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) consider RSRQ as the sorting quantity;
\( 1> \) set rsIndexResults to include up to maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport SS/PBCH block indexes or CSI-RS indexes in order of decreasing sorting quantity as follows:
\( 2> \) if the measurement information to be included is based on SS/PBCH block:
\( 3> \) include within resultsSSB-Indexes the index associated to the best beam for that SS/PBCH block sorting quantity and if absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation is included in the VarMeasConfig for the measObject associated to the cell for which beams are to be reported, the remaining beams whose sorting quantity is above absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation;
\( 3> \) if includeBeamMeasurements is set to true, include the SS/PBCH based measurement results for the quantities in reportQuantityRS-Indexes for each SS/PBCH block index;
\( 2> \) else if the beam measurement information to be included is based on CSI-RS:
\( 3> \) include within resultsCSI-RS-Indexes the index associated to the best beam for that CSI-RS sorting quantity and, if absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation is included in the VarMeasConfig for the measObject associated to the cell for which beams are to be reported, the remaining beams whose sorting quantity is above absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation;
\( 3> \) if includeBeamMeasurements is set to true, include the CSI-RS based measurement results for the quantities in reportQuantityRS-Indexes for each CSI-RS index.
5.5.5.3 Sorting of cell measurement results

The UE shall determine the sorting quantity according to parameters of the reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the reporting:
\( 1> \) if the reportType is set to eventTriggered:
\( 2> \) for an NR cell, consider the quantity used in the aN-Threshold (for eventAl, eventA2 and eventA4) or in the a5-Threshold2 (for eventA5) or in the aN-Offset (for eventA3 and eventA6) as the sorting quantity;
\( 2> \) for an E-UTRA cell, consider the quantity used in the \( b N \)-ThresholdEUTRA as the sorting quantity;
\( 2> \) for an UTRA-FDD cell, consider the quantity used in the \( b N \)-ThresholdUTRA-FDD as the sorting quantity;
\( 2> \) for a candidate L2 U2N Relay UE, consider the y \( N \)-Threshold2-Relay as the sorting quantity;
\( 1> \) if the reportType is set to periodical:
