NOTE: If multiple NR cells are triggered in conditional reconfiguration execution, it is up to UE implementation which one to select, e.g. the UE considers beams and beam quality to select one of the triggered cells for execution.
5.3.5.13.5 Conditional reconfiguration execution

The UE shall:
1> if more than one triggered cell exists:
\( 2> \) select one of the triggered cells as the selected cell for conditional reconfiguration execution;
1> else:
\( 2> \) consider the triggered cell as the selected cell for conditional reconfiguration execution;
\( 1> \) for the selected cell of conditional reconfiguration execution:
\( 2> \) apply the stored condRRCReconfig of the selected cell and perform the actions as specified in 5.3.5.3;
NOTE: If multiple NR cells are triggered in conditional reconfiguration execution, it is up to UE implementation which one to select, e.g. the UE considers beams and beam quality to select one of the triggered cells for execution.
5.3.5.13a SCG activation

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if the UE is configured with an SCG after receiving the message for which this procedure is initiated:
\( 2> \) consider the SCG to be activated;
2 if the UE was configured with a deactivated SCG before receiving the message for which this procedure is initiated:

Editor's note:FFS whether to remove the condition above if that is handled in TS 38.321.
3> resume performing radio link monitoring on the SCG, if previously stopped;
3> indicate to lower layers that the SCG is activated.
5.3.5.13b SCG deactivation

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> consider the SCG to be deactivated;
\( 1> \) reset SCG MAC;
1> indicate to lower layers that the SCG is deactivated;
Editor's note: FFS whether to make the above statement conditional to the SCG being previously activated.
1> If bfd-and-RLM is not configured to true:
\( 2> \) stop radio link monitoring on the SCG;
\( 2> \) indicate to lower layers to stop beam failure detection on the PSCell;
\( 2> \) stop timer T310 for this cell group, if running;
\( 2> \) stop timer T312 for this cell group, if running;
\( 2> \) reset the counters N310 and N311;
