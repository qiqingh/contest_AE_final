5.5a Logged Measurements
5.5a. 1 Logged Measurement Configuration
5.5a.1.1 General

Figure 5.5a.1.1-1: Logged measurement configuration

The purpose of this procedure is to configure the UE to perform logging of measurement results while in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE. The procedure applies to logged measurements capable UEs that are in RRC_CONNECTED.

NOTE: NG-RAN may retrieve stored logged measurement information by means of the UE information procedure.
5.5a.1.2 Initiation

NG-RAN initiates the logged measurement configuration procedure to UE in RRC_CONNECTED by sending the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message.
5.5a.1.3 Reception of the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration by the UE

Upon receiving the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message the UE shall:
1> discard the logged measurement configuration as well as the logged measurement information as specified in 5.5a.2;

1> store the received loggingDuration, reportType and areaConfiguration, if included, in VarLogMeasConfig;
1> if the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message includes plmn-IdentityList:
\( 2> \) set plmn-IdentityList in VarLogMeasReport to include the RPLMN as well as the PLMNs included in plmnIdentityList;

1> else:
\( 2> \) set plmn-IdentityList in VarLogMeasReport to include the RPLMN;
\( 1> \) store the received absoluteTimeInfo, traceReference, traceRecordingSessionRef, and \( t c e-I d \), and sigLoggedMeas Type in VarLogMeasReport;
\( 1> \) store the received \( b t \)-NameList, if included, in VarLogMeasConfig;
1> store the received wlan-NameList, if included, in VarLogMeasConfig;
1> store the received sensor-NameList, if included, in VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 1> \) start timer T330 with the timer value set to the loggingDuration;
\( 1> \) store the received earlyMeasIndication, if included, in VarLogMeasConfig;
