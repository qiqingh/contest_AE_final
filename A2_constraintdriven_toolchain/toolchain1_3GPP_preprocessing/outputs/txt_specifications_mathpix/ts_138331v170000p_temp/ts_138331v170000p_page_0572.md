\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline FrequencyinfoUL-SIB field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absoluteFrequencyPointA \\
Absolute frequency of the reference resource block (Common RB 0). Its lowest subcarrier is also known as Point A. Note that the lower edge of the actual carrier is not defined by this field but rather in the scs-SpecificCarrierList (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.4.4.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyBandList \\
Provides the frequency band indicator and a list of additionalPmax and additionalSpectrumEmission values as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15], table 6.2.3.1-1, and TS 38.101-2 [39], table 6.2.3.1-2. The UE shall apply the first listed band which it supports in the frequencyBandList field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyShift7p5khz \\
Enable the NR UL transmission with a 7.5 kHz shift to the LTE raster. If the field is absent, the frequency shift is disabled.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-Max \\
Value in dBm applicable for the cell. If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.1012 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT, the IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scs-SpecificCarrierList \\
A set of carriers for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3). The network configures this for all SCSs that are used in UL BWPs configured in this serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline FDD-OrSUL & The field is mandatory present if this Frequency/nfoUL-SIB is for the paired UL for a DL (defined in a Frequency/nfoDL-SIB) or if this FrequencylnfoUL-SIB is for a supplementary uplink (SUL). It is absent otherwise (if this FrequencylnfoUL-SIB is for an unpaired UL (TDD). \\
\hline FDD-TDD-OrSUL-Optional & The field is optionally present, Need R, if this Frequency/nfoUL-SIB is for the paired UL for a DL (defined in a Frequency/nfoDL-S/B), or if this Frequency/nfoUL-SIB is for an unpaired UL (TDD) in certain bands (as defined in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 and in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 38.104 [12]), or if this Frequency/nfoUL-SIB is for a supplementary uplink (SUL). It is absent otherwise. \\
