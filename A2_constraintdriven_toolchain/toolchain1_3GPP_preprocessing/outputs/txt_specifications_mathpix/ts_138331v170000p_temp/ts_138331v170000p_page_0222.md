message or the E-UTRA UEAssistanceInformation message. The specific information transferred in this message is set in accordance with:
- the procedure specified in 5.6.10 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA UEAssistanceInformation message;
- the procedure specified in 5.10 .2 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA SidelinkUEInformation message;
- the procedure specified in 5.5.5 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA MeasurementReport Message.
5.7.2b. 2 Initiation

A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer dedicated inter-RAT information as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
5.7.2b. 3 Actions related to transmission of ULInformation TransferIRAT message

The UE shall set the contents of the ULInformationTransferIRAT message as follows:
1> if there is a need to transfer dedicated LTE information related to V2X sidelink communications:
\( 2> \) set the ul-DCCH-MessageEUTRA to include the V2X sidelink communication information to be transferred (e.g. the E-UTRA RRC MeasurementReport message, the E-UTRA RRC SidelinkUEInformation message, or the E-UTRA RRC UEAssistanceInformation message);

1> submit the ULInformationTransferIRAT message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
5.7.3 SCG failure information
5.7.3.1 General

Figure 5.7.3.1-1: SCG failure information

The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN or NR MN about an SCG failure the UE has experienced i.e. SCG radio link failure, failure of SCG reconfiguration with sync, SCG configuration failure for RRC message on SRB3, SCG integrity check failure, and consistent uplink LBT failures on PSCell for operation with shared spectrum channel access.
5.7.3.2 Initiation

A UE initiates the procedure to report SCG failures when neither MCG nor SCG transmission is suspended and when one of the following conditions is met:
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure for the SCG, in accordance with clause 5.3.10.3;
1> upon detecting beam failure of the PSCell while the SCG is deactivated, in accordance with TS 38.321[3];
\( 1> \) upon reconfiguration with sync failure of the SCG, in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.3;
\( 1> \) upon SCG configuration failure, in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.2;
1> upon integrity check failure indication from SCG lower layers concerning SRB3.
