maxPUSCH-Duration \\
If present, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can only be transmitted using uplink grants that result in a PUSCH duration shorter than or equal to the duration indicated by this field. Otherwise, UL MAC SDUs from this logical channel can be transmitted using an uplink grant resulting in any PUSCH duration. Corresponds to "maxPUSCHDuration" in TS 38.321 [3]. The PUSCH duration is calculated based on the same length of all symbols, and the shortest length applies if the symbol lengths are different.

Logical channel priority, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].

Value in kiloBytes/s. Value \( k B p s 0 \) corresponds to 0 kiloBytes/s, value \( k B p s 8 \) corresponds to 8 kiloBytes/s, value \( k B p s 16 \) corresponds to 16 kiloBytes/s, and so on. For SRBs, the value can only be set to infinity.

If present, it indicates the scheduling request configuration applicable for this logical channel, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].

\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline PDCP-CADuplication & The field is mandatory present if the DRB/SRB associated with this logical channel is configured with PDCP CA duplication in UL in the cell group in which this IE is included (i.e. the PDCP entity is associated with multiple RLC entities belonging to this cell group). Otherwise the field is optionally present, need R . \\
\hline UL & The field is mandatory present for a logical channel with uplink if it serves DRB. It is optionally present, Need R, for a logical channel with uplink if it serves an SRB. Otherwise it is absent. \\

- LogicalChannelldentity

The IE LogicalChannelldentity is used to identify one logical channel (LogicalChannelConfig) and the corresponding RLC bearer (RLC-BearerConfig) or BH RLC channel (BH-RLC-ChannelConfig) or Uu Relay RLC channel (Uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelConfig).

- MAC-CellGroupConfig

The IE MAC-CellGroupConfig is used to configure MAC parameters for a cell group, including DRX.
