\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BWP-UplinkDedicated field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamFailureRecoveryConfig \\
Configuration of beam failure recovery. If supplementaryUplink is present, the field is present only in one of the uplink carriers, either UL or SUL.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantConfig \\
A Configured-Grant of type 1 or type2. It may be configured for UL or SUL but in case of type 1 not for both at a time. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure configured GrantConfig when there is an active configured uplink grant Type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the configured GrantConfig at any time. Network can only configure configured grant in one BWP using either this field or configuredGrantConfigToAddModList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantConfigToAddModList \\
Indicates a list of one or more configured grant configurations to be added or modified for one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure a Type 2 configured grant configuration when it is active (see TS 38.321 [3]). The network configures multiple CG configurations with either all configurations or no configuration configured with cg-Retransmission Timer-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantConfigToReleaseList \\
Indicates a list of one or more UL Configured Grant configurations to be released. The NW may release a configured grant configuration at any time.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configuredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList \\
Indicates a list of the deactivation states in which each state can be mapped to a single or multiple Configured Grant type 2 configurations to be deactivated when the corresponding deactivation DCI is received, see clause 7.3.1 in TS 38.212 [17] and clause 10.2 in TS 38.213 [13].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cp-ExtensionC2, cp-ExtensionC3 \\
Configures the cyclic prefix (CP) extension (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.1). For 15 kHz SCS , \{1..28\} are valid for both cp-ExtensionC2 and cp-ExtensionC3. For 30 kHz SCS, \( \{1 . .28\} \) are valid for \( c p \)-ExtensionC2 and \( \{2 . .28\} \) are valid for \( c p \)-ExtensionC3. For 60 kHz SCS, \( \{2 . .28\} \) are valid for \( c p \)-ExtensionC2 and \( \{3 . .28\} \) are valid for \( c p \) ExtensionC3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ibt-FailureRecoveryConfig \\
Configures parameters used for detection of consistent uplink LBT failures for operation with shared spectrum channel access, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-Config \\
PUCCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL, the network configures PUCCH only on the BWPs of one of the uplinks (normal UL or SUL). The network configures PUCCH-Config at least on non-initial BWP(s) for SpCell and PUCCH SCell. If supported by the UE, the network may configure at most one additional SCell of a cell group with PUCCH-Config (i.e. PUCCH SCell); if PUCCH cell switching is supported by the UE, the network may configure at most one additional SCell with PUCCH-Config within each PUCCH group. \\
In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, the NW configures at most one serving cell per frequency range with PUCCH. In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, if two PUCCH groups are configured, the serving cells of the NR PUCCH group in FR2 use the same numerology. For NR-DC, the maximum number of PUCCH groups in each cell group is one, and only the same numerology is supported for the cell group with carriers only in FR2. \\
The NW may configure PUCCH for a BWP when setting up the BWP. The network may also add/remove the pucch-Config in an RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync (for SpCell or PUCCH SCell) or with SCell release and add (for PUCCH SCell) to move the PUCCH between the UL and SUL carrier of one serving cell. In other cases, only modifications of a previously configured pucch-Config are allowed. \\
If one (S)UL BWP of a serving cell is configured with PUCCH, all other (S)UL BWPs must be configured with PUCCH, too.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ConfigurationList \\
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1). Different PUCCH Resource IDs are configured in different PUCCH-Config within the pucch-ConfigurationList if configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast1 \\
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks for MBS multicast (see TS 38.213, clause 9).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast2 \\
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed NACK-only feedback for MBS multicast (see TS 38.213, clause 9).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pusch-Config \\
PUSCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL and if it has a PUSCH-Config for both UL and SUL, an ULSUL indicator field in DCI indicates which of the two to use. See TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PUCCH-Config \\
Indicates the UE specific PUCCH configurations used for the HARQ-ACK feedback reporting for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
