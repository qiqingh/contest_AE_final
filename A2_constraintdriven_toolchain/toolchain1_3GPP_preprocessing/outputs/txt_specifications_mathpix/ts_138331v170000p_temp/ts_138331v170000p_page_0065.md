1> else:
\( 2> \) set the establishmentCause in accordance with the information received from upper layers;
NOTE 2: In case the L2 U2N Relay UE initiates RRC connection establishment according to conditions as specified in 5.3.3.1a, the L2 U2N Relay UE sets the establishmentCause by implementation. If the cause value in the message received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 is emergency, mpsPriorityAccess, or mcs-PriorityAccess, the L2 U2N Relay UE can set the same valuel Otherwise, the L2 U2N Relay UE does not set the value as emergency, mps-PriorityAccess, or mcs-PriorityAccess.

The UE shall submit the RRCSetupRequest message to lower layers for transmission.
The UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection are fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in 5.3.3.6.

NOTE 3: For L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE, the cell (re)selection procedure as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and relay (re)selection procedure as specified in 5.8.15.3 are performed independently and up to UE implementation to select either a cell or a L2 U2N Relay UE.
5.3.3.4 Reception of the RRCSetup by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the RRCSetup:
\( 1> \) if the RRCSetup is received in response to an RRCReestablishmentRequest; or
\( 1> \) if the RRCSetup is received in response to an RRCResumeRequest or RRCResumeRequest I:
\( 2> \) discard any stored UE Inactive AS context and suspendConfig;
\( 2> \) discard any current AS security context including the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCint}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the Kupenc key;
\( 2> \) release radio resources for all established RBs except SRB0, including release of the RLC entities, of the associated PDCP entities and of SDAP;
\( 2> \) release the RRC configuration except for the default L1 parameter values, default MAC Cell Group configuration and CCCH configuration;
\( 2> \) indicate to upper layers fallback of the RRC connection;
\( 2> \) discard any application layer measurement reports which were not transmitted yet;
\( 2> \) inform upper layers about the release of all application layer measurement configurations;
\( 2> \) stop timer T380, if running;
1> perform the cell group configuration procedure in accordance with the received masterCellGroup and as specified in 5.3.5.5;

1> perform the radio bearer configuration procedure in accordance with the received radioBearerConfig and as specified in 5.3.5.6;

1> if stored, discard the cell reselection priority information provided by the cellReselectionPriorities or inherited from another RAT;

1> stop timer T300, T301, T319 or T319a if running;
1> if T390 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T390 for all access categories;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1> if T302 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T302;
