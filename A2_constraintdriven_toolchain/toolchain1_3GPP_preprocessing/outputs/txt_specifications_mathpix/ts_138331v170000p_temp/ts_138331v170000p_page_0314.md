5.8.14 NR sidelink U2N Relay UE operation
5.8.14.1 General

This procedure is used by a UE supporting NR sidelink U2N Relay UE operation configured by upper layers to receive/ transmit NR sidelink discovery messages to evaluate AS layer conditions.
5.8.14.2 NR sidelink U2N Relay UE threshold conditions

A UE capable of NR sidelink U2N Relay UE operation shall:
