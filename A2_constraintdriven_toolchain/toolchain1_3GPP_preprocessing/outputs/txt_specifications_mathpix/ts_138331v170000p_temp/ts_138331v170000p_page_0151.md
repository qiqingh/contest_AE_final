\( 2> \) if the UE has connection establishment failure or connection resume failure information available in VarConnEstFailReport or VarConnEstFailReportList and if the RPLMN is equal to plmn-Identity stored in VarConnEstFailReport or VarConnEstFailReportList:

3> include connEstFaillnfoAvailable in the RRCResumeComplete message;
\( 2> \) if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report; or
\( 2> \) if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10] and if the UE is capable of cross-RAT RLF reporting and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10]:
\( 3> \) include rlf-InfoAvailable in the RRCResumeComplete message;
\( 2> \) if the UE has successful handover information available in VarSuccessHO-Report and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarSuccessHO-Report:

3> include successHO-InfoAvailable in the RRCResumeComplete message;
\( 2> \) if the UE supports storage of mobility history information and the UE has mobility history information available in VarMobilityHistoryReport:

3> include the mobilityHistoryAvail in the RRCResumeComplete message;
\( 2> \) if speedStateReselectionPars is configured in the SIB2:
3> include the mobilityState in the RRCResumeComplete message and set it to the mobility state (as specified in TS 38.304 [20]) of the UE just prior to entering RRC_CONNECTED state;
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap requirement information of NR target bands:
3> include the NeedForGapsInfoNR and set the contents as follows:
4> include intraFreq-needForGap and set the gap requirement information of intra-frequency measurement for each NR serving cell;

4> if requestedTargetBandFilterNR is configured, for each supported NR band that is also included in requestedTargetBandFilterNR, include an entry in interFreq-needForGap and set the gap requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry in interFreq-needForGap and set the corresponding gap requirement information for each supported NR band;
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of NR target bands:

3> include the NeedForNCSG-InfoNR and set the contents as follows:
4> include intraFreq-needForNCSG and set the gap and NCSG requirement information of intrafrequency measurement for each NR serving cell;

4> if requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-NR is configured, for each supported NR band included in requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-NR, include an entry in interFreq-needForNCSG and set the NCSG requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry for each supported NR band in interFreq-needForNCSG and set the corresponding NCSG requirement information;
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap and NCSG requirement information of E-UTRA target bands:

3> include the NeedForNCSG-InfoEUTRA and set the contents as follows:
\( 4> \) if requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-EUTRA is configured, for each supported E-UTRA band included in requestedTargetBandFilterNCSG-EUTRA, include an entry in needForNCSG-EUTRA and set the NCSG requirement information for that band; otherwise, include an entry for each supported E-UTRA band in needForNCSG-EUTRA and set the corresponding NCSG requirement information;
