\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CellGroupConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bap-Address \\
BAP address of the parent node in cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bh-RLC-ChannelToAddModList \\
Configuration of the backhaul RLC entities and the corresponding MAC Logical Channels to be added and modified.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bh-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList \\
List of the backhaul RLC entities and the corresponding MAC Logical Channels to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
f1c-TransferPath \\
The F1-C transfer path that an EN-DC IAB-MT should use for transferring F1-C packets to the IAB-donor-CU. If IAB-MT is configured with ite, IAB-MT can only use LTE leg for F1-C transfer. If IAB-MT is configured with \( n r \), IAB-MT can only use NR leg for F1-C transfer. If IAB-MT is configured with both, it is up to IAB-MT to select an LTE leg or a NR leg for F1-C transfer. If the field is not configured, the IAB node uses the NR leg as the default one.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
f1c-TransferPathNRDC \\
The F1-C transfer path that an NR-DC IAB-MT should use for transferring F1-C packets to the IAB-donor-CU. If IAB-MT is configured with mcg, IAB-MT can only use the MCG for F1-C transfer. If IAB-MT is configured with scg, IAB-MT can only use the SCG for F1-C transfer. If IAB-MT is configured with both, it is up to IAB-MT to select the MCG or the SCG for F1-C transfer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mac-CellGroupConfig \\
MAC parameters applicable for the entire cell group.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ric-BearerToAddModList \\
Configuration of the MAC Logical Channel, the corresponding RLC entities and association with radio bearers.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportUplinkTxDirectCurrent \\
Enables reporting of uplink and supplementary uplink Direct Current location information upon BWP configuration and reconfiguration. This field is only present when the BWP configuration is modified or any serving cell is added or removed. This field is absent in the IE CellGroupConfig when provided as part of RRCSetup message. If UE is configured with SUL carrier, UE reports both UL and SUL Direct Current locations.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier \\
Enables reporting of uplink Direct Current location information when the UE is configured with uplink intra-band CA with two carriers. This field is absent in the IE CellGroupConfig when provided as part of RRCSetup message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
riminSyncOutOfSyncThreshold \\
BLER threshold pair index for IS/OOS indication generation, see TS 38.133 [14], table 8.1.1-1. n1 corresponds to the value 1. When the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0 . Whenever this is reconfigured, UE resets N310 and N311, and stops T310, if running. Network does not include this field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sCellSIB20 \\
This field is used to transfer SIB20 of the SCell in order to allow the UE for MBS broadcast reception on SCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sCellState \\
Indicates whether the SCell shall be considered to be in activated state upon SCell configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sCellToAddModList \\
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be added or modified.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sCellToReleaseList \\
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be released.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
secondaryDRX-GroupConfig \\
The field is used to indicate whether the SCell belongs to the secondary DRX group. All serving cells in the secondary DRX group shall belong to one Frequency Range and all serving cells in the legacy DRX group shall belong to another Frequency Range.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1, simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2 \\
List of serving cells which can be updated simultaneously for spatial relation with a MAC CE. The simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1 and simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2 shall not contain same serving cells. Network should not configure serving cells that are configured with a BWP with two different values for the coresetPoollndex in these lists.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 \\
List of serving cells which can be updated simultaneously for TCI relation with a MAC CE. The simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1 and simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 shall not contain same serving cells. Network should not configure serving cells that are configured with a BWP with two different values for the coresetPoollndex in these lists.
