ssb-PositionsinBurst \\
Indicates the time domain positions of the transmitted SS-blocks in a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks as defined in TS 38.213[13], clause 4.1. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not transmitted while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is transmitted.

- SSB-PositionQCL-Relation

The IE SSB-PositionQCL-Relation is used to indicate the QCL relationship between SSB positions on the frequency indicated by ssbFrequency (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1) for operation with shared spectrum channel access. Value n 1 corresponds to 1 , value n 2 corresponds to 2 and so on.

- SSB-ToMeasure

The IE SSB-ToMeasure is used to configure a pattern of SSBs. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, only mediumBitmap is used.
