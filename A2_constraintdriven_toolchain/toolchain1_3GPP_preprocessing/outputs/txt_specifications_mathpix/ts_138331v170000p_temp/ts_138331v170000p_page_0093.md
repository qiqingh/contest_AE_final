\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the security algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the keys ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCenc }} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRC int }} \) ) associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {eNB }} \) ) or secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse, if applicable;
\( 3> \) else (i.e., UE connected to NR or UE connected to E-UTRA/EPC):
\( 4> \) configure the PDCP entity with the security algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the keys ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCint}} \) ) associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) or secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse, if applicable;
