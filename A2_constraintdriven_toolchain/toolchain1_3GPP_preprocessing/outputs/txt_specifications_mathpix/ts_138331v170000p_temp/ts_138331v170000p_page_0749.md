\hline Reference Timelnfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
referenceSFN \\
This field indicates the reference SFN corresponding to the reference time information. If referenceTime/nfo field is received in DLinformationTransfer message, this field indicates the SFN of PCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
time \\
This field indicates time reference with 10 ns granularity. If included in DLinformationTransfer and if UE-side TA PDC is de-activated, the indicated time may not be referenced at the network, i.e., gNB may pre-compensate. If included in DLinformationTransfer and if UE is requested to transmit UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, the indicated time may not be referenced at the network, i.e., gNB may pre-compensate. Otherwise, the indicated time is referenced at the network, i.e., without compensating for RF propagation delay. \\
The indicated time in 10 ns unit from the origin is refDays*86400*1000*100000+refSeconds*1000*100000+refMilliSeconds*100000+refTenNanoSeconds. The refDays field specifies the sequential number of days (with day count starting at 0 ) from the origin of the time field. \\
If the referenceTimeInfo field is received in DLInformationTransfer message, the time field indicates the time at the ending boundary of the system frame indicated by referenceSFN. The UE considers this frame (indicated by referenceSFN) to be the frame which is nearest to the frame where the message is received (which can be either in the past or in the future). \\
If the referenceTimelnfo field is received in SIB9, the time field indicates the time at the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted. \\
If referenceTime/nfo field is received in SIB9, this field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of time should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in S/B1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeinfoType \\
If time/nfoType is not included, the time indicates the GPS time and the origin of the time field is 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time). If timelnfoType is set to localClock, the origin of the time is unspecified.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
uncertainty \\
This field indicates the uncertainty of the reference time information provided by the time field. The uncertainty is 25ns multiplied by this field. If this field is absent, the uncertainty is unspecified.
\end{tabular} \\
