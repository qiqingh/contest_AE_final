5.7.4.4 Relaxed measurement criterion for a stationary UE

The relaxed measurement criterion for a stationary UE is met when:
- (SrxlevReStationaryConnected - Srxlev \( )< \) S \( _{\text {SearchDeltaP-StationaryConnected }} \),

Where:
- Srxlev \( = \) current Srxlev value of the PCell cell (dB).
- Srxlev \( \mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{Re} \text { Stationary } \text { Connected }}= \) reference Srxlev value of the PCell cell (dB), set as follows:
- At the end of RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5.3, when rrmMeasRelaxationReportingConfig is included in the RRCReconfiguration message; or
- If \( \left(\right. \) Srxlev - Srxlev \( _{\text {ReStatonary }} \) Connected \( )>0 \); or
- If the relaxed measurement criterion has not been met for \( T_{\text {SearchDelaP-StabonaryConnected: }} \)
- The UE shall set the value of Srxlev \( \mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{Re} 5 \text { tationary }{ }^{2} \text { onnected to the current Srxlev value of the serving cell. }} \)
