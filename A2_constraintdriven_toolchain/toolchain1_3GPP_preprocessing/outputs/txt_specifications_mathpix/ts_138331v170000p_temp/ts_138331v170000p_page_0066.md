\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
\( 1> \) stop timer T320, if running;
\( 1> \) if the RRCSetup is received in response to an RRCResumeRequest, RRCResumeRequest I or RRCSetupRequest:
\( 2> \) if T331 is running:
3> stop timer T331;
3> perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3;
\( 2> \) enter RRC_CONNECTED;
\( 2> \) stop the cell re-selection procedure;
\( 2> \) stop relay (re)selection procedure if any for L2 U2N Remote UE;
\( 1> \) consider the current cell to be the PCell;
\( 1> \) if the RRCSetup message includes the sl-L2RemoteUEConfig (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) perform the L2 U2N Remote UE configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.5.16;
1> if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report:
\( 2> \) if reconnectCellld in VarRLF-Report is not set, and if the received RRCSetup is in response to an RRCSetupRequest:

3> if choCellld in VarRLF-Report is set:
4> set timeUntilReconnection in VarRLF-Report to the time that elapsed since the radio link failure or handover failure experienced in the failedPCellld stored in VarRLF-Report;
\( 3> \) else:
4> set timeUntilReconnection in VarRLF-Report to the time that elapsed since the last radio link failure or handover failure;

3> set nrReconnectCellld in reconnectCellld in VarRLF-Report to the global cell identity and the tracking area code of the PCell;

1> if the UE supports RLF report for inter-RAT MRO NR as defined in TS 36.306 [62], and if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10] and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10]:
\( 2> \) if reconnectCellld in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10] is not set:
3> set timeUntilReconnection in VarRLF-Report of TS \( 36.331[10] \) to the time that elapsed since the last radio link failure or handover failure in LTE;

3> set nrReconnectCellld in reconnectCellld in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331[10] to the global cell identity and the tracking area code of the PCell;
\( 1> \) set the content of RRCSetupComplete message as follows:
\( 2> \) if upper layers provide a 5 G-S-TMSI:
\( 3> \) if the RRCSetup is received in response to an RRCSetupRequest:
4> set the ng-5G-S-TMSI-Value to ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part2;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) set the ng-5G-S-TMSI-Value to ng-5G-S-TMSI;
