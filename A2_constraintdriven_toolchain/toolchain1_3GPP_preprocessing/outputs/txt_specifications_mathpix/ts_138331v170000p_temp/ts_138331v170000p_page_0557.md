\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PCCH-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
defaultPagingCycle \\
Default paging cycle, used to derive 'T' in TS 38.304 [20]. Value r 32 corresponds to 32 radio frames, value ff64 corresponds to 64 radio frames and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO \\
Points out the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging of each PO of the PF, see TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nAndPagingFrameOffset \\
Used to derive the number of total paging frames in T (corresponding to parameter N in TS 38.304 [20]) and paging frame offset (corresponding to parameter PF_offset in TS 38.304 [20]). A value of one SixteenthT corresponds to T / 16, a value of oneEighthT corresponds to T/8, and so on. \\
If pagingSearchSpace is set to zero and if SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3 (as specified in TS 38.213 [13]): \\
- for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 5 or 10 ms , N can be set to one of \{oneT, halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenth T\} \\
- for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 20 ms , N can be set to one of \{halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenth T\} \\
- for ssb-periodicityServingCell of \( 40 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~N} \) can be set to one of \{quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT\} \\
- for ssb-periodicityServingCell of 80 ms , N can be set to one of \{oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT\} \\
- for ssb-periodicityServingCell of \( 160 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{~N} \) can be set to oneSixteenthT \\
If pagingSearchSpace is set to zero and if SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern is 1 (as specified in TS 38.213 [13]), N can be set to one of (halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT\} \\
If pagingSearchSpace is not set to zero, N can be configured to one of \{oneT, halfT, quarterT, oneEighthT, oneSixteenthT\}
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ns \\
Number of paging occasions per paging frame.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ranPaginginldlePO \\
Indicates that the network supports to send RAN paging in PO that corresponds to the i_s as determined by UE in RRC_IDLE state, see TS38.304 [20].

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PEI-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O \\
Offset, in number of symbols, from the start of the reference frame for PEI-O to the start of the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of PEI-O, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4A. For the case po-NumPerPE/ is smaller than Ns, UE applies the (floor(i_s/poNumPerPEI)+1)-th value out of (N_s/po-NumPerPEI) configured values in firstPDCCH- \\
MonitoringOccasionOfPE/-O for the symbol-level offset. When po-NumPerPE/is one or mutliple of Ns, UE applies the first configured value in firstPDCCH- \\
Monitoring Occasion OfPE/-O for the symbol-level offset.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
payloadSizeDCI-2-7 \\
Payload size of PEI DCI, i.e., DCI format 2_7. The size is no larger than the payload size of paging DCI which has maximum of 41 bits and 43 bits for licensed and unlicensed spectrums, respectively.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pei-FrameOffset \\
Offset, in number of frames from the start of a first paging frame of the paging frames associated with the PEI-O to the start of a reference frame for PEI-O, see TS 38.213[13], clause 10.4A.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pei-SearchSpace \\
ID of dedicated search space for PEI. It can be configured to one of up to 4 common SS sets configured by commonSearchSpaceList with SearchSpaceld > 0. The CCE aggregation levels and maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level follows Table 10.1-1 of TS38.213 [13]. SearchSpaceld \( =0 \) can be configured for the case of SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
po-NumPerPEI \\
The number of \( \mathrm{PO}(\mathrm{s}) \) associated with one PEI monitoring occation. It is a factor of \( \mathrm{N} \times \mathrm{Ns} \) (total PO number in a paging cycle). The Maximum number of PF associated with one PEI monitoring occation is up to 2. The number of PO mapping to one PEI should be multiple of Ns when po-NumPerPEI is larger than Ns.
