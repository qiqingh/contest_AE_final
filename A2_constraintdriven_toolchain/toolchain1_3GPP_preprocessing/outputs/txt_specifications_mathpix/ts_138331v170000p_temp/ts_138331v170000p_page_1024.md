\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-ResourcePoo/ field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dummy \\
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-Additional-MCS-Table \\
Indicates the MCS table(s) additionally used in the resource pool. 64QAM table is (pre-)configured as default. Zero, one or two can be additionally (pre-)configured using the 256QAM and/or low-SE MCS tables. If two MCS tables are indicated, 256QAM MCS table is the \( 1^{\text {st }} \) table and qam64lowSE MCS table is the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) table as specified in TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.3.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-FilterCoefficient \\
This field indicates the filtering coefficient for long-term measurement and reference signal power derivation used for sidelink open-loop power control.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-InterUE-CoordinationConfig \\
Indicates the configured sidelink inter-UE coordination parameters.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-NumSubchannel \\
Indicates the number of subchannels in the corresponding resource pool, which consists of contiguous PRBs only.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PBPS-CPS-Config \\
Indicates configuration information for the operation of full sensing only, partial sensing only, random resource selection only, or any combination(s) configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PreemptionEnable \\
Indicates whether pre-emption is disabled or enabled in a resource pool. If the field is present and the value is pl1,pl2, and so on (but not enabled), it means that pre-emption is enabled and a priority level p_preemption is configured. If the field is present and the value is enabled, the pre-emption is enabled (but p_preemption is not configured) and pre-emption is applicable to all levels.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-Priority Threshold-UL-URLLC \\
Indicates the threshold used to determine whether NR sidelink transmission is prioritized over uplink transmission of priority index 1 as specified in TS 38.213[13], clause 16.2.4.3, or whether PUCCH transmission carrying SL HARQ is prioritized over PUCCH transmission carrying UCI of priority index 1 if they overlap in time as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5.0.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PriorityThreshold \\
Indicates the threshold used to determine whether NR sidelink transmission is prioritized over uplink transmission of priority index 0 as specified in TS 38.213[13], clause 16.2.4.3, or whether PUCCH transmission carrying SL HARQ is prioritized over PUCCH transmission carrying UCI of priority index 0 if they overlap in time as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5.0.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-RB-Number \\
Indicates the number of PRBs in the corresponding resource pool, which consists of contiguous PRBs only. The remaining RB cannot be used (See TS 38.214[19], clause 8).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-StartRB-Subchannel \\
Indicates the lowest RB index of the subchannel with the lowest index in the resource pool with respect to the lowest RB index of a SL BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-SubchannelSize \\
Indicates the minimum granularity in frequency domain for the sensing for PSSCH resource selection in the unit of PRB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-SyncAllowed \\
Indicates the allowed synchronization reference(s) which is (are) allowed to use the configured resource pool.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-SyncConfigindex \\
Indicates the synchronisation configuration that is associated with a reception pool, by means of an index to the corresponding entry SL-SyncConfigList of in SIB12 for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-TDD-Configuration \\
Indicates the TDD configuration associated with the reception pool of the cell indicated by si-SyncConfigindex.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-ThreshS-RSSI-CBR \\
Indicates the S-RSSI threshold for determining the contribution of a sub-channel to the CBR measurement. Value 0 corresponds to -112 dBm , value 1 to -110 dBm , value n to ( \( -112+\mathrm{n}^{\star} 2 \) ) dBm, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-TimeResource \\
Indicates the bitmap of the resource pool, which is defined by repeating the bitmap with a periodicity during a SFN or DFN cycle.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
