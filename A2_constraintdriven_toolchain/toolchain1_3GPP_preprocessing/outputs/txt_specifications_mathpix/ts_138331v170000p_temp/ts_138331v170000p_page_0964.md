- EUTRA-PhysCellIdRange

The IE EUTRA-PhysCellIdRange is used to encode either a single or a range of physical cell identities. The range is encoded by using a start value and by indicating the number of consecutive physical cell identities (including start) in the range. For fields comprising multiple occurrences of EUTRA-PhysCellldRange, NW may configure overlapping ranges of physical cell identities.

- EUTRA-PresenceAntennaPort1

The IE EUTRA-PresenceAntennaPortl is used to indicate whether all the neighbouring cells use Antenna Port 1. When set to true, the UE may assume that at least two cellspecific antenna ports are used in all neighbouring cells.

- EUTRA-Q-OffsetRange

The IE EUTRA-Q-OffsetRange is used to indicate a cell, or frequency specific offset to be applied when evaluating triggering conditions for measurement reporting. The value in dB . Value \( d B-24 \) corresponds to -24 dB , value \( d B-22 \) corresponds to -22 dB and so on.
