1> receive DL-SCH on the cell where the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message was received for the MBS broadcast service for which the broadcast MRB is established and using g-RNTI and mtch-SchedulingInfo (if included) in this message for this MBS broadcast service;
\( 1> \) configure the physical layer in accordance with the mbs-SessionInfoList, searchSpaceMTCH, pdschConfigMTCH, applicable for the broadcast MRB, as included in the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message;
\( 1> \) inform upper layers about the establishment of the broadcast MRB by indicating the corresponding \( t m g i \);
\( 1> \) if an SDAP entity with the received tmgi does not exist:
\( 2> \) establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1.
5.9.3.4 Broadcast MRB release

Upon broadcast MRB release for MBS broadcast service, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) release the PDCP entity, RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer configuration;
\( 1> \) inform upper layers about the release of the broadcast MRB by indicating the corresponding \( t m g i \);
\( 1> \) if the SDAP entity associated with the corresponding tmgi has no associated MRB:
\( 2> \) release the SDAP entity, as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.2.
5.9.4 MBS Interest Indication
5.9.4.1 General

Figure 5.9.4.1-1: MBS Interest Indication

The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state is receiving or is interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) and to inform the network about the priority of MBS broadcast versus unicast reception. MBS Interest Indication can only be sent after AS security activation.
5.9.4.2 Initiation

An MBS capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases including upon successful connection establishment, upon entering or leaving the broadcast service area, upon MBS broadcast session start or stop, upon change of interest, upon change of priority between MBS broadcast reception and unicast reception, upon change to a PCell broadcasting SIB21.

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if SIB21 is provided by the PCell:
\( 2> \) ensure having a valid version of SIB21 for the PCell;
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit MBS Interest Indication since last entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
\( 2> \) if since the last time the UE transmitted an MBS Interest Indication, the UE connected to a PCell not broadcasting SIB21:
