\( 2> \) if timer T316 is running;
\( 3> \) stop timer T316;
\( 3> \) clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
\( 2> \) resume MCG transmission, if suspended.
\( 1> \) stop timer T312 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
1> if sl-PathSwitchConfig is included:
\( 2> \) consider the target L2 U2N Relay UE to be the one indicated by the targetRelayUEIdentity in the \( s l \) PathSwitchConfig;
\( 2> \) start timer T420 for the corresponding target L2 U2N Relay UE with the timer value set to T420, as included in the sl-PathSwitchConfig;
\( 2> \) apply the value of the newUE-Identity as the C-RNTI;
2> perform the PC5-RRC connection establishment with the target L2 U2N Relay UE indicated by the targetRelayUEIdentity, if needed;
\( 2> \) apply the default configuration of SL-RLC1 as defined in 9.2.4 for SRB1;
1> else (sl-PathSwitchConfig is not included):
\( 2> \) if this procedure is executed for the MCG or if this procedure is executed for an SCG not indicated as deactivated in the E-UTRA or NR RRC message in which the RRCReconfiguration message is embedded:

3> start timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell with the timer value set to \( t 304 \), as included in the reconfigurationWithSync;
\( 2> \) if the frequencyInfoDL is included:
3> consider the target SpCell to be one on the SSB frequency indicated by the frequencyInfoDL with a physical cell identity indicated by the physCellld;
\( 2> \) else:
3> consider the target SpCell to be one on the SSB frequency of the source SpCell with a physical cell identity indicated by the physCellld;
\( 2> \) start synchronising to the DL of the target SpCell;
\( 2> \) apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1 for the target SpCell;
2> acquire the MIB of the target SpCell, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
NOTE 1: The UE should perform the reconfiguration with sync as soon as possible following the reception of the RRC message triggering the reconfiguration with sync, which could be before confirming successful reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.

NOTE 2: The UE may omit reading the \( M I B \) if the UE already has the required timing information, or the timing information is not needed for random access.

NOTE 2a: A UE with DAPS bearer does not monitor for system information updates in the source PCell.
\( 2> \) If any DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 3> \) create a MAC entity for the target cell group with the same configuration as the MAC entity for the source cell group;

3> for each DAPS bearer:
4> establish an RLC entity or entities for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;
