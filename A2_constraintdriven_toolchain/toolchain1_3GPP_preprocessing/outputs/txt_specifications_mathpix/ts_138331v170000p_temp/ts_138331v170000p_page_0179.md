\( 4> \) perform CBR measurement on pools in \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal and \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency in SIB12;
\( 2> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 3> \) if \( t x \)-PoolMeasToAddModList is included in VarMeasConfig:
\( 4> \) perform CBR measurements on each transmission resource pool indicated in the \( t x \) PoolMeasToAddModList;
\( 3> \) if \( s \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal, sl-TxPoolScheduling or sl-TxPoolExceptional is included in slConfigDedicatedNR for the concerned frequency within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 4> \) perform CBR measurement on pool(s) in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal, sl-TxPoolScheduling or slTxPoolExceptional if included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR for the concerned frequency within RRCReconfiguration;
\( 3> \) else if the cell chosen for NR sidelink communication provides SIB12 which includes \( s \) TxPoolSelectedNormal or sl-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency:
\( 4> \) perform CBR measurement on pool(s) in \( s / \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal and \( s / \)-TxPoolExceptional for the concerned frequency in SIB12;

1> else:
\( 2> \) perform CBR measurement on pool(s) in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal and sl-TxPoolExceptional in SidelinkPreconfigNR for the concerned frequency.

NOTE 2: In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication and CBR measurement are acquired via the EUTRA, configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12, sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in this clause are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28, sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], respectively.

NOTE 3: If a UE that is configured by upper layers to transmit V2X sidelink communication is configured by NR with transmission resource pool(s) and the measurement objects concerning V2X sidelink communication (i.e. by sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info), it shall perform CBR measurement as specified in clause 5.5 .3 of TS 36.331 [10], based on the transmission resource pool(s) and the measurement object(s) concerning V2X sidelink communication configured by NR.

NOTE 4: For V2X sidelink communication, each of the CBR measurement results is associated with a resource pool, as indicated by the poolReportld (see TS 36.331 [10]), that refers to a pool as included in sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info or SIB13.

Editors Note: FFS to specify that the UE ignores measId(s) that were not indicated in the condExecutionCond/triggerCondition.
5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each cell measurement quantity, each beam measurement quantity, each sidelink measurement quantity as needed in clause 5.8.10, for each CLI measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1, and for each candidate L2 U2N Relay UE measurement quantity according to 5.5.3.4:
\( 2> \) filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
\[
F_{\mathrm{n}}=(1-a)^{*} F_{\mathrm{n}-1}+a^{*} M_{\mathrm{n}}
\]
where
\( M_{n} \) is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
