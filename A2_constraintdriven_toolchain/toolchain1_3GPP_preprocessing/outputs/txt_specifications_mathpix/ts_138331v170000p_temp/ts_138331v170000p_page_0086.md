\( 4> \) establish the logical channel for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;

NOTE 2b: In order to understand if a DAPS bearer is configured, the UE needs to check the presence of the field daps-Config within the RadioBearerConfig IE received in radioBearerConfig or radioBearerConfig2.
\( 3> \) for each SRB:
\( 4> \) establish an RLC entity for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;
\( 4> \) establish the logical channel for the target cell group, with the same configurations as for the source cell group;
\( 3> \) suspend SRBs for the source cell group;
NOTE 3: Void
\( 3> \) apply the value of the newUE-Identity as the C-RNTI in the target cell group;
\( 3> \) configure lower layers for the target SpCell in accordance with the received spCellConfigCommon;
\( 3> \) configure lower layers for the target SpCell in accordance with any additional fields, not covered in the previous, if included in the received reconfiguration WithSync.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) reset the MAC entity of this cell group;
\( 3> \) consider the SCell(s) of this cell group, if configured, that are not included in the SCellToAddModList in the RRCReconfiguration message, to be in deactivated state;
\( 3> \) apply the value of the newUE-Identity as the C-RNTI for this cell group;
\( 3> \) configure lower layers in accordance with the received spCellConfigCommon;
\( 3> \) configure lower layers in accordance with any additional fields, not covered in the previous, if included in the received reconfiguration WithSync.
\( 2> \) if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE at the source side):
\( 3> \) perform the PC5-RRC connection release as specified in 5.8.9.5.
Upon L2 U2N Relay UE receiving reconfiguration WithSync, it either triggers PC5-S release or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 58.9.10.
5.3.5.5.3 RLC bearer release

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each logicalChannelldentity/LogicalChannelldentityExt value included in the rlc-BearerToReleaseList/rlcBearerToReleaseListExt that is part of the current UE configuration within the same cell group (LCH release); or
\( 1> \) for each logicalChannelldentity value that is to be released as the result of an SCG release according to 5.3.5.4:
\( 2> \) release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3;
2> release the corresponding logical channel.
5.3.5.5.4 RLC bearer addition/modification

For each \( R L C \)-BearerConfig received in the rlc-BearerToAddModList [E the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE's current configuration contains an RLC bearer with the received logicalChannelldentity/LogicalChannelldentityExt within the same cell group:
