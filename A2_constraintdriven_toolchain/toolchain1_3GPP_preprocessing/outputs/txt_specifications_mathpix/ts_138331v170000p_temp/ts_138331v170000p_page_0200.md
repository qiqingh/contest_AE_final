reportConfig of the non-serving cell corresponding to the concerned measObjectNR with the highest measured RSRP if RSRP measurement results are available for cells corresponding to this measObjectNR, otherwise with the highest measured RSRQ if RSRQ measurement results are available for cells corresponding to this measObjectNR, otherwise with the highest measured SINR;
\( 4> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportQuantityRS-Indexes and maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport:
\( 5> \) for each best non-serving cell included in the measurement report:
\( 6> \) include beam measurement information according to the associated reportConfig as described in 5.5.5.2;
\( 1> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting is set to eventTriggered and eventID is set to eventA3, or eventA4, or eventA5, or eventB1, or eventB2:
\( 2> \) if the UE is in NE-DC and the measurement configuration that triggered this measurement report is associated with the MCG:
\( 3> \) set the measResultServFreqListEUTRA-SCG to include an entry for each E-UTRA SCG serving frequency with the following:
\( 4> \) include carrierFreq of the E-UTRA serving frequency;
4> set the measResultServingCell to include the available measurement quantities that the UE is configured to measure by the measurement configuration associated with the SCG;
\( 4> \) if reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportAddNeighMeas:
\( 5> \) set the measResultServFreqListEUTRA-SCG to include within measResultBestNeighCell the quantities of the best non-serving cell, based on RSRP, on the concerned serving frequency;
\( 1> \) if reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting is set to eventTriggered and eventID is set to eventA3, or eventA4, or eventA5:
\( 2> \) if the UE is in NR-DC and the measurement configuration that triggered this measurement report is associated with the MCG:
\( 3> \) set the measResultServFreqListNR-SCG to include for each NR SCG serving cell that is configured with serving CellMO, if any, the following:

4 if the reportConfig associated with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting includes rsType:
\( 5> \) if the serving cell measurements based on the rsType included in the reportConfig that triggered the measurement report are available according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG:
\( 6> \) set the measResultServingCell within measResultServFreqListNR-SCG to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on the rsType included in the reportConfig that triggered the measurement report;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) if SSB based serving cell measurements are available according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG:
\( 6> \) set the measResultServingCell within measResultServFreqListNR-SCG to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on SSB;
\( 5> \) else if CSI-RS based serving cell measurements are available according to the measurement configuration associated with the SCG:

6> set the measResultServingCell within measResultServFreqListNR-SCG to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on CSI-RS;
