\( 1> \) upon indication from MAC entity that the maximum number of consecutive HARQ DTX for a specific destination has been reached; or
\( 1> \) upon integrity check failure indication from sidelink PDCP entity concerning SL-SRB2 or SL-SRB3 for a specific destination:
\( 2> \) consider sidelink radio link failure to be detected for this destination;
\( 2> \) release the DRBs of this destination if configured, in according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
\( 2> \) release the SRBs of this destination, in according to clause 5.8.9.1a.3;
\( 2> \) release the PC5 Relay RLC channels of this destination if configured, in according to clause 5.8.9.7.1;
\( 2> \) discard the NR sidelink communication related configuration of this destination;
\( 2> \) reset the sidelink specific MAC of this destination;
\( 2> \) consider the PC5-RRC connection is released for the destination;
\( 2> \) indicate the release of the PC5-RRC connection to the upper layers for this destination (i.e. PC5 is unavailable);
\( 2> \) if UE is in RRC_CONNECTED:
3> if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via the PC5-RRC connection (i.e the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):

4> initiate the RRC connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7.
3> else:
4> perform the sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication procedure, as specified in 5.8.3.3;

NOTE: It is up to UE implementation on whether and how to indicate to upper layers to maintain the keep-alive procedure [55].
5.8.9.4 Sidelink common control information
5.8.9.4.1 General

The sidelink common control information is carried by MasterInformationBlockSidelink. The sidelink common control information may change at any transmission, i.e neither a modification period nor a change notification mechanism is used. This procedure also applies to sidelink discovery.

A UE configured to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE has a selected SyncRef UE, as specified in 5.8.6:
\( 2> \) ensure having a valid version of the MasterInformationBlockSidelink message of that SyncRef UE;
5.8.9.4.2 Actions related to reception of MasterInformationBlockSidelink message

Upon receiving MasterInformationBlockSidelink, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) apply the values included in the received MasterInformation BlockSidelink message.
5.8.9.4.3 Transmission of MasterInformationBlockSidelink message

The UE shall set the contents of the MasterInformationBlockSidelink message as follows:
1> if in coverage on the frequency used for the NR sidelink communication as defined in TS 38.304 [20].
\( 2> \) set inCoverage to true;
