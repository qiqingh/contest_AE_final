\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline EthernetHeaderCompression field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-ContinueEHC-DL \\
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the downlink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-ContinueEHC-UL \\
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the uplink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ehc-CID-Length \\
Indicates the length of the CID field for EHC packet. The value bits 7 indicates the length is 7 bits, and the value bits 15 indicates the length is 15 bits. Once the field ethernetHeaderCompression-r16 is configured for a DRB or a multicast MRB, the value of the field ehc-CID-Length for this DRB or multicast MRB is not reconfigured to a different value.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ehc-Common \\
Indicates the configurations that apply for both downlink and uplink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ehc-Downlink \\
Indicates the configurations that apply for only downlink. If the field is configured, then Ethernet header compression is configured for downlink. Otherwise, it is not configured for downlink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ehc-Uplink \\
Indicates the configurations that apply for only uplink. If the field is configured, then Ethernet header compression is configured for uplnik. Otherwise, it is not configured for uplink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxCID-EHC-UL \\
Indicates the value of the MAX_CID_EHC_UL parameter as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The total value of MAX_CID_EHC_UL across all bearers for the UE should be less than or equal to the value of maxNumberEHC-Contexts parameter as indicated by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline UplinkDataCompression field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bufferSize \\
This field indicates the buffer size applied for UDC as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value kbyte2 means 2048 bytes, kbyte 4 means 4096 bytes and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dictionary \\
This field indicates which pre-defined dictionary is used for UDC as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The value sip-SDP means that UE shall prefill the buffer with standard dictionary for SIP and SDP defined in TS 38.323 [5], and the value operator means that UE shall prefill the buffer with operator-defined dictionary.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-ContinueUDC \\
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the uplink data compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
