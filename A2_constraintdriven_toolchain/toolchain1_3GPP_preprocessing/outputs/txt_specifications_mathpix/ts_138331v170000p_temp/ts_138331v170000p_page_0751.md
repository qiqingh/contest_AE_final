\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RepetitionSchemeConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fdm-TDM \\
Configures UE with a repetition scheme among fdmSchemeA, fdmSchemeB and tdmSchemeA as specified in clause 5.1 of TS 38.214 [19]. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release slotBased if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sequenceOffsetForRV \\
For slot-based repetition scheme, selected RV sequence is applied to transmission occasions associated to the first TCI state. The RV sequence associated to the second TCI state is determined by a RV offset from that selected RV sequence.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
slotBased \\
Configures UE with slot-based repetition scheme. Network always configures this field when the parameter repetitionNumber is present in IE PDSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocationList. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release fdm-TDM if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
startingSymbolOffsetK \\
The starting symbol of the second transmission occasion has K symbol offset relative to the last symbol of the first transmission occasion. When UE is configured with tdmSchemeA, the parameter starting SymbolOffsetK is present, otherwise absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tciMapping \\
Enables TCI state mapping method to PDSCH transmission occasions.
\end{tabular} \\

- ReportConfigid

The IE ReportConfigld is used to identify a measurement reporting configuration.
ReportConfigid information element
-- ASNISTART
-- TAG-REPORTCONFIGID-START

ReportConfigId : := INTEGER (1. maxReportConfigId)
-- TAG-REPORTCONFIGID-STOP
-- ASNISTOP
- ReportConfigInterRAT

The IE ReportConfigInterRAT specifies criteria for triggering of an inter-RAT measurement reporting event, or an L2 U2N relay measurement reporting event. The inter-RAT measurement reporting events for E-UTRA and UTRA-FDD and L2 U2N Relay UE are labelled B \( N \) with \( N \) equal to 1, 2 and so on.

Event B1: Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event B2: PCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Neighbour becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event Y1: PCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND candidate L2 U2N Relay UE becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event Y2: Candidate L2 U2N Relay UE becomes better than absolute threshold;
