\hline LoggedMeasurementConfiguration field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absolute TimeInfo \\
Indicates the absolute time in the current cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
areaConfiguration \\
Used to restrict the area in which the UE performs measurement logging to cells broadcasting either one of the included cell identities or one of the included tracking area codes/ frequencies.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
earlyMeasindication \\
If included, the field indicates the UE is allowed to log measurements on early measurement related frequencies in logged measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eventType \\
The value outOfCoverage indicates the UE to perform logging of measurements when the UE enters any cell selection state, and the value eventL1 indicates the UE to perform logging of measurements when the triggering condition (similar as event A2 as specified in 5.5.4.3) as configured in the event is met for the camping cell in camped normally state.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pimn-IdentityList \\
Indicates a set of PLMNs defining when the UE performs measurement logging as well as the associated status indication and information retrieval i.e. the UE performs these actions when the RPLMN is part of this set of PLMNs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sigLoggedMeasType \\
If included, the field indicates a signalling based logged measurements (See TS 37.320 [61]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tce-id \\
Parameter Trace Collection Entity Id: See TS 32.422 [52].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
traceRecordingSessionRef \\
Parameter Trace Recording Session Reference: See TS 32.422 [52].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportType \\
Parameter configures the type of MDT configuration, specifically Periodic MDT configuration or Event Triggerd MDT configuration.
