3> setup the gap sharing configuration for the FR2 measurement gap in accordance with the received gapSharing as defined in TS 38.133 [14];
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) release the gap sharing configuration (if configured) for the FR2 measurement gap;
1> for each GapConfig received in gapUEToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if a per UE measurement gap configuration associated with the measGapld indicated by the GapConfig is already setup, release the per UE measurement gap configuration;
\( 2> \) setup a per UE measurement gap configuration indicated by the GapConfig in accordance with the received gapOffset, i.e., the first subframe of each gap occurs at an SFN and subframe meeting the following condition:
\( \mathrm{SFN} \bmod T=\mathrm{FLOOR}( \) gapOffset/10);
subframe \( = \) gapOffset \( \bmod 10 \);
with \( T= \) MGRP/10 as defined in TS 38.133 [14];
\( 2> \) apply the specified timing advance \( m g t a \) to the gap occurrences calculated above (i.e. the UE starts the
measurement \( m g t a \mathrm{~ms} \) before the gap subframe occurrences);
\( 2> \) associate the per UE measurement gap with the measGapld indicated by the GapConfig;
\( 2> \) if gapSharing in the GapConfig is present:
\( 3> \) setup the gap sharing configuration for the per UE measurement gap in accordance with the received gapSharing as defined in TS 38.133 [14];
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) release the gap sharing configuration (if configured) for the per UE measurement gap;
1> for each FR1, FR2, and per UE measurement gap that is setup:
\( 2> \) if preConfigInd-r17 in the corresponding GapConfig is present:
3> determine whether the measurement gap is activated or not according to TS 38.133 [14];
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) consider the measurement gap to be activated;
NOTE 1: For FR2 gap configuration with synchronous CA, for the UE in NE-DC or NR-DC, the SFN and subframe of the serving cell indicated by the refServCellIndicator is used in the gap calculation. Otherwise, the SFN and subframe of a serving cell on FR2 frequency is used in the gap calculation

NOTE 2: For FR1 gap or per UE gap configuration, for the UE in NE-DC or NR-DC, the SFN and subframe of the serving cell indicated by the refServCellindicator in is used in the gap calculation. Otherwise, the SFN and subframe of the PCell is used in the gap calculation.

NOTE 3: For FR2 gap configuration with asynchronous CA, for the UE in NE-DC or NR-DC, the SFN and subframe of the serving cell indicated by the refServCellIndicator and refFR2ServCellAsyncCA is used in the gap calculation. Otherwise, the SFN and subframe of a serving cell on FR2 frequency indicated by the refFR2ServCellAsyncCA is used in the gap calculation
5.5.2.10 Reference signal measurement timing configuration

The UE shall setup the first SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (providing Periodicity and Offset value for the following condition) in the smtcl configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:
