5.2.2.4.6 Actions upon reception of SIB5

No UE requirements related to the contents of this SIB5 apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the concerned system information, and/ or within the corresponding field descriptions.
5.2.2.4.7 Actions upon reception of SIB6

Upon receiving the SIB6 the UE shall:
1> forward the received warningType, messageldentifier and serialNumber to upper layers;
5.2.2.4.8 Actions upon reception of SIB7

Upon receiving the SIB7 the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if there is no current value for messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7; or
1> if either the received value of messageldentifier or of serialNumber, or of both messageldentifier and serialNumber are different from the current values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7:
\( 2> \) use the received values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7 as the current values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7;
\( 2> \) discard any previously buffered warningMessageSegment;
\( 2> \) if all segments of a warning message have been received:
