\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PHR-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dummy \\
This field is not used in this version of the specification and the UE ignores the received value.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpe-ProhibitTimer \\
Value in number of subframes for MPE reporting, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpe-Reporting-FR2 \\
Indicates whether the UE shall report MPE P-MPR in the PHR MAC control element, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpe-ResourcePool \\
List of SSB/CSI-RS resources for P-MPR reporting. Each resource is configured with serving cell index where the resource is configured for the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpe-Threshold \\
Value of the P-MPR threshold in dB for reporting MPE P-MPR when FR2 is configured, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
multiplePHR \\
Indicates if power headroom shall be reported using the Single Entry PHR MAC control element or Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. True means to use Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element and False means to use the Single Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. The network configures this field to true for MR-DC and UL CA for NR, and to false in all other cases.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfN \\
Number of reported P-MPR values in a PHR MAC CE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phr-ModeOtherCG \\
Indicates the mode (i.e. real or virtual) used for the PHR of the activated cells that are part of the other Cell Group (i.e. MCG or SCG), when DC is configured. If the UE is configured with only one cell group (no DC), it ignores the field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phr-PeriodicTimer \\
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phr-ProhibitTimer \\
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sfO corresponds to 0 subframe, value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange \\
Value in dB for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value \( d B 1 \) corresponds to \( 1 \mathrm{~dB}, d B 3 \) corresponds to 3 dB and so on. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phr-Type2OtherCell \\
If set to true, the UE shall report a PHR type 2 for the SpCell of the other MAC entity. See TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.4.6. Network sets this field to false if the UE is not configured with an E-UTRA MAC entity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
twoPHRMode \\
Indicates if the power headroom shall be reported as two PHRs (each PHR associated with a SRS resource set) is enabled or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
