Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Measurement reporting

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE to the network. The UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.

For the measld for which the measurement reporting procedure was triggered, the UE shall set the measResults within the MeasurementReport message as follows:
\( 1> \) set the measid to the measurement identity that triggered the measurement reporting;
1> for each serving cell configured with servingCellMO:
\( 2> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes rsType:
3> if the serving cell measurements based on the rsType included in the reportConfig that triggered the measurement report are available:

4> set the measResultServingCell within measResultServingMOList to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on the rsType included in the reportConfig that triggered the measurement report;
\( 2> \) else:
3> if SSB based serving cell measurements are available:
4> set the measResultServingCell within measResultServingMOList to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on SSB;

3> else if CSI-RS based serving cell measurements are available:
4> set the measResultServingCell within measResultServingMOList to include RSRP, RSRQ and the available SINR of the serving cell, derived based on CSI-RS;

1> set the servCellId within measResultServingMOList to include each NR serving cell that is configured with serving CellMO, if any;
\( 1> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportQuantityRS-Indexes and maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport:
\( 2> \) for each serving cell configured with servingCellMO, include beam measurement information according to the associated reportConfig as described in 5.5.5.2;
\( 1> \) if the reportConfig associated with the measId that triggered the measurement reporting includes reportAddNeighMeas:
\( 2> \) for each measObjectld referenced in the measIdList which is also referenced with servingCellMO, other than the measObjectld corresponding with the measld that triggered the measurement reporting:

3> if the measObjectNR indicated by the servingCellMO includes the RS resource configuration corresponding to the rsType indicated in the reportConfig:

4> set the measResultBestNeighCell within measResultServingMOList to include the physCellld and the available measurement quantities based on the reportQuantityCell and rsType indicated in
