\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SRS-Resource, SRS-PosResource field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cyclicShift-n2 \\
Cyclic shift configuration (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cyclicShift-n4 \\
Cyclic shift configuration (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
enableStartRBHopping \\
When this RRC parameter is configured, start RB location hopping is enabled for partial frequency sounding in different SRS frequency hopping periods for periodic/semipersistent/aperiodic SRS as described in Clause 6.4.1.4 in TS 38.211.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
freqHopping \\
Includes parameters capturing SRS frequency hopping (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this field such that \( b \)-hop > b-SRS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
groupOrSequenceHopping \\
Parameter(s) for configuring group or sequence hopping (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.4.2). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this parameter to 'neither'.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSRS-Ports \\
Number of ports. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this parameter to 'port1'.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityAndOffset-p \\
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sil corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sil2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sli the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, si 1280 and s/ 2560 cannot be configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityAndOffset-sp \\
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sil corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value s/ 2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sli the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ptrs-Portindex \\
The PTRS port index for this SRS resource for non-codebook based UL MIMO. This is only applicable when the corresponding PTRS-UplinkConfig is set to CP-OFDM. The ptrs-Portindex configured here must be smaller than the maxNrofPorts configured in the PTRS-UplinkConfig (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.3.1). This parameter is not applicable to CLI SRS-RSRP measurement.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourceMapping \\
OFDM symbol location of the SRS resource within a slot including nrofSymbols (number of OFDM symbols), startPosition (value 0 refers to the last symbol, value 1 refers to the second last symbol, and so on) and repetitionFactor (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1 and TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.4). The configured SRS resource does not exceed the slot boundary. If resourceMapping-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix). If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbois and repetitionFactor to ' n 1 '.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourceType \\
Periodicity and offset for semi-persistent and periodic SRS resource (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, only 'periodic' is applicable for resource Type.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sequenceld \\
Sequence ID used to initialize pseudo random group and sequence hopping (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servingCellld \\
The serving Cell ID of the source SSB, CSI-RS, or SRS for the spatial relation of the target SRS resource. If this field is absent the SSB, the CSI-RS, or the SRS is from the same serving cell where the SRS is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
spatialRelationinfo \\
Configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and the target SRS. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). This parameter is not applicable to CLI SRS-RSRP measurement.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
spatialRelationInfo-PDC \\
Configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and the target SRS. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS/DL-PRS-PDC (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). The field is present in case of resource Type=periodic and usagePDC-r17=true in the SRS-ResourceSet, otherwise the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
