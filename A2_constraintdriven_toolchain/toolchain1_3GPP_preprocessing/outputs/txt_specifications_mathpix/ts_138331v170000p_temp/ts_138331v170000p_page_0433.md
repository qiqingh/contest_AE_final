\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SIB2 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation \\
Threshold for consolidation of L1 measurements per RS index. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellEdgeEvaluation \\
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect that it is not at cell edge, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.2 and clause 5.2.4.9.Y).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellEdgeEvaluationWhileStationary \\
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect that it is not at cell edge while stationary, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.Y).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellEquivalentSize \\
The number of cell count used for mobility state estimation for this cell as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellReselectioninfoCommon \\
Cell re-selection information common for intra-frequency, inter-frequency and/ or inter-RAT cell re-selection.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellReselectionServingFreqinfo \\
Information common for non-intra-frequency cell re-selection i.e. cell re-selection to inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
combineRelaxedMeasCondition \\
When both lowMobilityEvalutation and cellEdgeEvalutation criteria are present in SIB2, this parameter configures the UE to fulfil both criteria in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection. If the field is absent, the UE is allowed to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection when either or both of the criteria are met. (See TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
combineRelaxedMeasCondition2 \\
When both stationaryMobilityEvaluation and cellEdgeEvaluationWhileStationary criteria are present in SIB2, this parameter configures the UE to fulfil both criteria in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection. If the field is absent, the UE is allowed to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection when only the stationary criteria is met. (See TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell \\
This field indicates whether the UE can utilize serving cell timing to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the serving frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyBandList \\
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR cell reselection parameters apply. The UE behaviour in case the field is absent is described in clause 5.2.2.4.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
highPriorityMeasRelax \\
Indicates whether measurements can be relaxed on high priority frequencies (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0). If the field is absent, the UE shall not relax measurements on high priority frequencies beyond " \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {higher_priority_search" }} \) unless both low mobility and not at cell edge criteria are fulfilled (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 4.2.2.7, and TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intraFreqCellReselectioninfo \\
Cell re-selection information common for intra-frequency cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
IowMobilityEvaluation \\
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect low mobility, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage \\
Number of SS blocks to average for cell measurement derivation. If the field is absent the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
p-Max \\
Value in dBm applicable for the intra-frequency neighbouring NR cells. If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if \( p \)-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. The IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-Hyst \\
Parameter "Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20], Value in dB. Value dB1 corresponds to \( 1 \mathrm{~dB}, d B 2 \) corresponds to 2 dB and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-HystSF \\
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20]. The sf-Medium and sf-High concern the additional hysteresis to be applied, in Medium and High Mobility state respectively, to Qhyst as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. In dB. Value \( d B-6 \) corresponds to \( -6 \mathrm{~dB}, d B-4 \) corresponds to -4 dB and so on.
