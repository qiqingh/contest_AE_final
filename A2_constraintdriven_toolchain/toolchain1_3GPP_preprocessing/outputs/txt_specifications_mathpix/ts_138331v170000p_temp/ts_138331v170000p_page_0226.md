\( 3> \) ordering the cells with sorting as follows:
\( 4> \) based on SS/PBCH block if SS/PBCH block measurement results are available and otherwise based on CSI-RS;

4 - using RSRP if RSRP measurement results are available, otherwise using RSRQ if RSRQ measurement results are available, otherwise using SINR;

3> for each neighbour cell included:
\( 4> \) include the optional fields that are available.
NOTE 1: The measured quantities are filtered by the L3 filter as configured in the mobility measurement configuration. The measurements are based on the time domain measurement resource restriction, if configured. Exclude-listed cells are not required to be reported.

NOTE 2: Field measResultSCG-Failure is used to report available results for NR frequencies the UE is configured to measure by SCG RRC signalling.
\( 1> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7.
1> if the UE supports SCG failure for mobility robustness optimization:
\( 2> \) if the failureType is set to synchReconfigFailureSCG; or
\( 2> \) if the failureType is set to randomAccessProblem and the SCG failure was declared while T304 was running:
\( 3> \) set perRAInfoList to indicate the performed random access procedure related information as specified in 5.7.10.5.

3> set the failedPSCellld to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the target PSCell of the failed PSCell change;

3> set the previousPSCellld to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the source PSCell where the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync for the SCG was received;

3> set the timeSCGFailure to the elapsed time since reception of the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync for the SCG;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the failedPSCellld to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the PSCell in which the SCG failure was declared;

3> if the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync for the SCG was received to enter the PSCell in which the SCG failure was declared:

4> set the timeSCGFailure to the elapsed time since reception of the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync for the SCG;
\( 4> \) set the previousPSCellId to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency of the PSCell where the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync for the SCG was received;

The UE shall submit the SCGFailureInformation message to lower layers for transmission.
