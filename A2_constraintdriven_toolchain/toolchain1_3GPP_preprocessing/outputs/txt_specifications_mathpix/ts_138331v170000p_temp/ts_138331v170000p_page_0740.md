\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline DRB-ToAddMod and MRB-ToAddMod field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cnAssociation \\
Indicates if the bearer is associated with the eps-bearerldentity (when connected to EPC) or sdap-Config (when connected to 5GC).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
daps-Config \\
Indicates that the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-Identity \\
In case of DC, the DRB identity is unique within the scope of the UE, i.e. an MCG DRB cannot use the same value as a split DRB. For a split DRB the same identity is used for the MCG and SCG parts of the configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eps-Beareridentity \\
The EPS bearer ID determines the EPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrb-Identity \\
Identification of the multicast MRB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mrb-IdentityNew \\
New identity of the multicast MRB when mrb-/dentity needs to be changed, e.g. as a result of a handover.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reestablishPDCP \\
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to termination point change for the bearer, reconfiguration with sync, resuming an RRC connection, or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. It is also applicable for LTE procedures when NR PDCP is configured. Network doesn't include this field for DRB if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
recoverPDCP \\
Indicates that PDCP should perform recovery according to TS 38.323 [5]. Network doesn't include this field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sdap-Config \\
The SDAP configuration determines how to map QoS flows to DRBs when NR or E-UTRA connects to the 5GC and presence/absence of UL/DL SDAP headers.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
\( t m g i \) \\
Indicates which MBS session the bearer is associated with.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RadioBearerConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
securityConfig \\
Indicates the security algorithm and key to use for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included after AS security has been activated, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse and security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig. The field is not included when configuring SRB1 before AS security is activated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srb3-ToRelease \\
Release SRB3. SRB3 release can only be done over SRB1 and only at SCG release and reconfiguration with sync.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
