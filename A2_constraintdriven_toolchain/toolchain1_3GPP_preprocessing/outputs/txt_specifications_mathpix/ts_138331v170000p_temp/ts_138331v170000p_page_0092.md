\( 1> \) if the RadioBearerConfig includes the drb-ToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform DRB addition or reconfiguration as specified in 5.3.5.6.5;
\( 1> \) if the RadioBearerConfig includes the mrb-ToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) perform multicast MRB release as specified in 5.3.5.6.6;
\( 1> \) if the RadioBearerConfig includes the mrb-ToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform multicast MRB addition or reconfiguration as specified in 5.3.5.6.7;
\( 1> \) release all SDAP entities, if any, that have no associated DRB as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.2, and indicate the release of the user plane resources for PDU Sessions associated with the released SDAP entities to upper layers;
\( 1> \) release all SDAP entities that have no associated multicast MRB , and indicate the release of user plane resources for these MBS multicast sessions to upper layers.
5.3.5.6.2 SRB release

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) release the PDCP entity and the srb-Identity of the SRB3 or SRB4.
5.3.5.6.3 SRB addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) If any DAPS bearer is configured, for each SRB:
2> establish a PDCP entity for the target cell group as specified in TS 38.323 [5], with the same configuration as the PDCP entity for the source cell group;
\( 2> \) if the masterKeyUpdate is received:
\( 3> \) configure the PDCP entity with the security algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the keys ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { enc }} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { mt }} \) ) associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) );
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) configure the PDCP entity for the target cell group with state variables continuation as specified in TS 38.323 [5], and with the same security configuration as the PDCP entity for the source cell group;
\( 1> \) for each \( s r b \)-Identity value included in the srb-ToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (SRB establishment or reconfiguration from E-UTRA PDCP to NR PDCP):
\( 2> \) establish a PDCP entity;
\( 2> \) if AS security has been activated:
\( 3> \) if target RAT of handover is E-UTRA/5GC; or
\( 3> \) if the UE is connected to E-UTRA/5GC:
4 if the UE is capable of E-UTRA/5GC, but not capable of NGEN-DC:
\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the security algorithms and keys ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCint}} \) ) configured/derived as specified in TS 36.331 [10];
