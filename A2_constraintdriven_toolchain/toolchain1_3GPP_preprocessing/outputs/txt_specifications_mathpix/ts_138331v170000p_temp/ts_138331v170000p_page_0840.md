\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-ToMeasure \\
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The firstfleftmost bit corresponds to SS block index 0 , the second bit corresponds to SS block index 1 , and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the IAB-MT measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.
