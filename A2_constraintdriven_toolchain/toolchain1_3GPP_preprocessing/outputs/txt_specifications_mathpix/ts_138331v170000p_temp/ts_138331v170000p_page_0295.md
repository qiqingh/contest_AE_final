\( 2> \) reconfigure the logical channel of the sidelink DRB , in accordance with the \( s / \)-MACLogicalChannelConfigPC5 received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink or sl-MAC-LogicalChannelConfig received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR, if included.
5.8.9.1a. 3 Sidelink SRB release

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if a PC5-RRC connection release for a specific destination is requested by upper layers or AS layer; or
\( 1> \) if the sidelink radio link failure is detected for a specific destination:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of the sidelink SRB for PC5-RRC message of the specific destination;
\( 2> \) consider the PC5-RRC connection is released for the destination.
\( 1> \) if PC5-S transmission for a specific destination is terminated in upper layers:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of the sidelink SRB(s) for PC5-S message of the specific destination;
\( 1> \) if discovery transmission for a specific destination is terminated in upper layers:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of the sidelink SRB4 for discovery message of the specific destination;
5.8.9.1a. 4 Sidelink SRB addition

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if transmission of PC5-S message for a specific destination is requested by upper layers for sidelink SRB:
\( 2> \) establish PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of a sidelink SRB for PC5-S message, as specified in clause 9.1.1.4;
\( 1> \) if transmission of discovery message for a specific destination is requested by upper layers for sidelink SRB:
\( 2> \) establish PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of a sidelink SRB4 for discovery message, as specified in clause 9.1.1.4;
\( 1> \) if a PC5-RRC connection establishment for a specific destination is indicated by upper layers:
\( 2> \) establish PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of a sidelink SRB for PC5-RRC message of the specific destination, as specified in clause 9.1.1.4;
\( 2> \) consider the PC5-RRC connection is established for the destination.
