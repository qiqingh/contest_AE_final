5.3.14.2 Initiation

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:
\( 2> \) consider the access attempt as barred;
\( 1> \) else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither ' 2 ' nor ' 0 ':
\( 2> \) consider the access attempt as barred;
1> else:
\( 2> \) if the Access Category is ' 0 ':
\( 3> \) consider the access attempt as allowed;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if SIBI includes uac-BarringPerPLMN-List that contains a UAC-BarringPerPLMN for the selected PLMN or SNPN:

4> if the procedure in 5.2.2.4.2 for a selected PLMN resulted in use of information in npn-IdentitylnfoList and UAC-BarringPerPLMN has an entry with the plmn-Identitylndex corresponding to used information in this list:
\( 5> \) select the UAC-BarringPerPLMN entry with the plmn-IdentityIndex corresponding to used information in the npn-IdentitylnfoList;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) select the UAC-BarringPerPLMN entry with the plmn-IdentityIndex corresponding to the selected PLMN and the PLMN-IdentityInfo, if any, or the selected SNPN and the npn-IdentityInfoList;
\( 3> \) if any UAC-BarringPerPLMN entry is selected:
\( 4> \) in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected UAC-BarringPerPLMN entry (i.e presence or absence of access barring parameters in this entry) irrespective of the uac-BarringForCommon included in SIBI;
\( 3> \) else if SIB1 includes uac-BarringForCommon:
\( 4> \) in the remainder of this procedure use the \( u a c \)-BarringForCommon (i.e presence or absence of these parameters) included in SIBI;
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) consider the access attempt as allowed;
\( 3> \) if \( u a c \)-BarringForCommon is applicable or the \( u a c \)-ACBarringListType indicates that \( u a c \) ExplicitACBarringList is used:
\( 4> \) if the corresponding UAC-BarringPerCatList contains a UAC-BarringPerCat entry corresponding to the Access Category:
\( 5> \) select the UAC-BarringPerCat entry;
\( 5> \) if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the UAC-BarringPerCat:
\( 6> \) select the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry;
\( 6> \) perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in 5.3.14.5, using the selected UAC-BarringInfoSet as "UAC barring parameter";
\( 5> \) else:
