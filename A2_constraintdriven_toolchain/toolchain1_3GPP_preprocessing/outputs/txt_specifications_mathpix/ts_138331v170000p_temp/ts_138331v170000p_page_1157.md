The SetupRelease is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example below is not allowed:
```
-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE \
    field-rX SetupRelease { SEQUENCE { -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
            fieldl-rX IEl-rX,
            field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL -- Need N
        }
        } OPTIONAL, -- Need M
}
-- /example/ ASN1STOP
```


If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the type itself, namely, "setup" and "release". For example, procedural text for field-rX above could be as follows:
\( 1> \) if field-r \( X \) is set to "setup":
\( 2> \) do something;
\( 1> \) else (field-r \( X \) is set to "release"):
\( 2> \) release field-rX (if appropriate).
A.3.9 Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList

In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release-lists should be used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN. 1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list. In other words, the ASN. 1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
```
-- /example/ ASN1START
AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {
```

```
    ...
}
Element ::= SEQUENCE \
    elementId ElementId,
    aField INTEG ER (0..16777215),
    anotherField OCTET STRING,
    ...
}
```
