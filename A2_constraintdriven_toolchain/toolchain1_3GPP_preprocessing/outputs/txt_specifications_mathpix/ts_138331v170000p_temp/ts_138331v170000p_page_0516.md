\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicity \\
Periodicity for UL transmission without UL grant for type 1 and type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.2). \\
The following periodicities are supported depending on the configured subcarrier spacing [symbols]:
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityExt \\
This field is used to calculate the periodicity for UL transmission without UL grant for type 1 and type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5,8.2). If this field is present, the field periodicity is ignored. \\
The following periodicites are supported depending on the configured subcarrier spacing [symbols]: \\
15 kHz : \\
30 kHz : \\
60 kHz with normal CP: \\
60 kHz with ECP: \\
120 kHz : \\
480 kHz : \\
960 kHz : \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 640 . \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 1280. \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 2560. \\
periodicityExt*12, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 2560. \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 5120 . \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 20480. \\
periodicityExt*14, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 40960.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
phy-Prioritylndex \\
Indicates the PHY priority of CG PUSCH at least for PHY-layer collision handling. Value \( p 0 \) indicates low priority and value \( p 1 \) indicates high priority. The network does not configure this for CG-SDT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerControlloopToUse \\
Closed control loop to apply (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
powerControlLoopToUse2 \\
Closed control loop to apply to second SRS resource set (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1.1). If this field is present, the powerControlloopToUse applies to the first SRS resource set.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
precodingAndNumberOfLayers \\
Precoding and number of MIMO layers applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1.1). In case of CG-SDT network configures single antenna port for single layer transmission.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
precodingAndNumberOfLayers 2 \\
Indicates the precoding and number of layers for the second SRS resource set. When this field is present, precodingAndNumberOfLayers indicated the precoding and number of layers for the first SRS resource set.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pusch-RepTypelndicator \\
Indicates whether UE follows the behavior for PUSCH repetition type A or the behavior for PUSCH repetition type B for each Type 1 configured grant configuration. The value pusch-RepTypeA enables the 'PUSCH repetition type A' and the value pusch-RepTypeB enables the 'PUSCH repetition type B' (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.3). The value pusch-RepTypeB is not configured simultaneously with cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot-r16 and cg-nrofSlots-r16. The network does not configure this field if cg-RetransmissionTimer-r16 is configured for CG operation with shared spectrum channel access.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rbg-Size \\
Selection between configuration 1 and configuration 2 for RBG size for PUSCH. The UE does not apply this field if resourceAllocation is set to resourceAllocationType1. \\
Otherwise, the UE applies the value config 1 when the field is absent. Note: rbg-Size is used when the transformPrecoder parameter is disabled.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
repK-RV \\
The redundancy version (RV) sequence to use. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2. The network configures this field if repetitions are used, i.e., if repK is set to \( n 2, n 4 \) or \( n 8 \). This field is not configured when cg-RetransmissionTimer is configured. Otherwise, the field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
repK \\
Number of repetitions K, see TS 38.214 [19]. If the field repK-r17 is present, the UE shall ignore the repK (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
