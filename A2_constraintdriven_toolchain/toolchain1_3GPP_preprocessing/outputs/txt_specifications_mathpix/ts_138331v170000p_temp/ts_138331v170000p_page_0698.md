\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PUCCH-ConfigCommon field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
hoppingld \\
Cell-specific scrambling ID for group hopping and sequence hopping if enabled, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.2.2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intra-SlotFH-r17 \\
In case a separate initial UL BWP is configured for RedCap UEs, the presence of this parameter indicates whether intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within the separate initial UL BWP in the common PUCCH resource is enabled for RedCap UEs. If this field is absent, intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is enabled. If this field is present, intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is disabled and each PUCCH resource is mapped to a single PRB on one side of the UL BWP and this parameter determines whether the PRB index in the PRB mapping is counted in increasing order from the lower edge or in decreasing order from the upper edge of the UL BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofPRBs \\
Indicates the number of PRBs used per PUCCH resource for PUCCH format 0 and format 1 in FR2-2, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
po-nominal \\
Power control parameter P0 for PUCCH transmissions. Value in dBm. Only even values (step size 2) allowed (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-GroupHopping \\
Configuration of group- and sequence hopping for all the PUCCH formats \( 0,1,3 \) and 4 . Value neither implies neither group or sequence hopping is enabled. Value enable enables group hopping and disables sequence hopping. Value disable disables group hopping and enables sequence hopping (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.2.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ResourceCommon \\
An entry into a 16-row table where each row configures a set of cell-specific PUCCH resources/parameters. The UE uses those PUCCH resources until it is provided with a dedicated PUCCH-Config (e.g. during initial access) on the initial uplink BWP. Once the network provides a dedicated PUCCH-Config for that bandwidth part the UE applies that one instead of the one provided in this field (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ResourceCommon-RedCap \\
An entry into a 16-row table where each row configures a set of cell-specific PUCCH resources/parameters for RedCap UEs. The UE uses those PUCCH resources until it is provided with a dedicated PUCCH -Config (e.g. during initial access) on the initial uplink BWP. Once the network provides a dedicated PUCCH -Config for that bandwidth part the UE applies that one instead of the one provided in this field (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pucch-ResourceConfig-RedCap \\
When intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is disabled, each common PUCCH resource is mapped to a single PRB on one side of the UL BWP. This parameter determines an additional PRB offset in the PRB mapping for the PUCCH resource. If the field is not configured, the UE shall assume an additional PRB offset of zero.

- PUCCH-ConfigurationList

The IE PUCCH-ConfigurationList is used to configure UE specific PUCCH parameters (per BWP) for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.
