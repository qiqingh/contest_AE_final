\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasTiming field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierFreq, ssbSubcarrierSpacing \\
Indicates the frequency and subcarrier spacing of the SS block of the cell for which this message is included, or of other SS blocks within the same carrier.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-MeasurementTimingConfiguration \\
Indicates the SMTC which can be used to search for SSB of the cell for which the message is included. When the message is included in "Served NR Cell Information" (see TS 36.423 [37]), "Served Cell Information NR" (see TS 38.423 [35]), or "Served Cell Information" (see TS 38.473 [36]), the timing is based on the cell for which the message is included. When the message is included in "NR Neighbour Information" (see TS 36.423 [37]), or "Served Cell Information" (see TS 38.423 [35]), the timing is based on the cell indicated in the "Served NR Cell Information" or "Served Cell Information NR" with which the "NR Neighbour Information" or "Neighbour Information NR" is provided. When the message is included in "CU to DU RRC Information", the timing is based on the cell indicated by SpCell ID with which the message is included.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ss-RSSI-Measurement \\
Provides the configuration which can be used for RSSI measurements of the cell for which the message is included.
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasurementTimingConfiguration field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
campOnFirstSSB \\
Value true indicates that the SSB indicated in the first instance of MeasTiming in the measTiming list can be used for camping and for a PCell configuration (i.e. in spCellConfigCommon of the masterCellGroup).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-RS-CellMobility \\
Indicates the CSI-RS configuration of the cell for which this message is included. The timing of the CSI-RS resources is based on the SSB indicated by refSSBFreq.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-RS-SubcarrierSpacing \\
Indicates the subcarrier spacing of the CSI-RS resources included in csi-rs-CellMobility.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measTiming \\
A list of SMTC information, SSB RSSI measurement information and associated NR frequency exchanged via EN-DC X2 Setup, EN-DC Configuration Update, Xn Setup and NG-RAN Node Configuration Update procedures, or F1 messages between gNB DU and gNB CU.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
physCellld \\
Physical Cell Identity of the SSB on the ARFCN indicated by carrierFreq.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
psCellOnlyOnFirstSSB \\
Value true indicates that only the SSB indicated in the first instance of MeasTiming in the measTiming list can be used for a PSCell configuration (i.e. in spCellConfigCommon of the secondaryCellGroup).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-ToMeasure \\
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]).
