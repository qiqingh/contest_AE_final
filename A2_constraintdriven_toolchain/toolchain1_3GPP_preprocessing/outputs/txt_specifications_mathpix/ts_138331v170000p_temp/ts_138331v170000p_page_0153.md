\( 5> \) append the VarConnEstFailReport as a new entry in the VarConnEstFailReportList;
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with release cause 'RRC Resume failure'.

1> else if upon receiving Integrity check failure indication from lower layers while T319 or T319a is running:
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with release cause 'RRC Resume failure'.

1> else if indication from the MCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached is received while T319a is running; or

1> if random access problem indication is received from MCG MAC while T319a is running; or
1> if the lower layers indicate that cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer expired before receiving network response for the UL CG-SDT transmission with CCCH message while T319a is running; or

1> if T319a expires:
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with release cause 'RRC Resume failure'.

The UE may discard the connection resume failure or connection establishment failure information, i.e release the UE variable VarConnEstFailReport, 48 hours after the last connection resume failure is detected.

The L2 U2N Relay UE either triggers PC5-S release or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 5.8.9.10.
5.3.13.6 Cell re-selection or cell selection or L2 U2N relay (re)selection while T390, T319, T319a or T302 is running (UE in RRC_INACTIVE)

The UE shall:
1> if cell reselection occurs while T319 or T302 or T319a is running; or
1> if relay reselection occurs while T319 is running; or
1> if cell changes due to relay reselection while T302 is running:
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with release cause 'RRC Resume failure';

1> else if cell selection or reselection occurs while T390 is running, or cell change due to relay selection or reselection occurs while T390 is running:
\( 2> \) stop T390 for all access categories;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4.
5.3.13.7 Reception of the RRCSetup by the UE

The UE shall:
1> perform the RRC connection setup procedure as specified in 5.3.3.4.
5.3.13.8 RNA update

In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE shall:
1> if T380 expires; or
\( 1> \) if RNA Update is triggered at reception of SIB1, as specified in 5.2.2.4.2:
\( 2> \) if T319a is not running:
