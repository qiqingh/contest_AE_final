\hline CellAccessRelatedinfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellReservedForFutureUse \\
Indicates whether the cell is reserved, as defined in 38.304 [20] for future use. The field is applicable to all PLMNs and NPNs. This field is ignored by IAB-MT.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellReservedForOtherUse \\
Indicates whether the cell is reserved, as defined in 38.304 [20]. The field is applicable to all PLMNs. This field is ignored by IAB-MT for cell barring determination, but still considered by NPN capable IAB-MT for determination of an NPN-only cell.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
npn-IdentitylnfoList \\
The npn-Identity/nfoList is used to configure a set of NPN-/dentity/nfo elements. Each of those elements contains a list of one or more NPN Identities and additional information associated with those NPNs. The total number of PLMNs (identified by a PLMN identity in pimn -/dentityList), PNI-NPNs (identified by a PLMN identity and a CAG-ID), and SNPNs (identified by a PLMN identity and a NID) together in the PLMN-dentitylnfoList and NPN-IdentitylnfoList does not exceed 12, except for the NPN-only cells. A PNI-NPN and SNPN can be included only once, and in only one entry of the NPN-dentitylnfoList. In case of NPN-only cells the PLMN-dentityList contains a single element that does not count to the limit of 12. The NPN index is defined as \( B+c 1+c 2+\ldots+c(n-1)+d 1+d 2+\ldots+d(m-1)+e(i) \) for the NPN identity included in the \( n \)-th entry of NPN-ddentity/nfoList and in the \( m \)-th entry of non-Identitylist within that NPN-IdentitylinfoList entry, and the \( i \)-th entry of its corresponding NPN-Identity, where \\
- \( B \) is the index used for the last PLMN in the PLMN-dentitty/nfoList; in NPN-only cells B is considered 0 ; \\
- c(j) is the number of NPN index values used in the \( j \)-th NPN-IdentitylinfoList entry; \\
- \( d(k) \) is the number of NPN index values used in the \( k \)-th npn-IdentityList entry within the \( n \)-th NPN-IdentitylnfoList entry; \\
- e(i) is \\
- \( i \) if the \( n \)-th entry of NPN-IdentitylnfoList entry is for SNPN(s); \\
- 1 if the \( n \)-th entry of NPN-IdentitylnfoList entry is for PNI-NPN(s).

pimn-IdentityinfoList \\
The pimn-Identity/nfoList is used to configure a set of PLMN-/dentity/nfo elements. Each of those elements contains a list of one or more PLMN Identities and additional information associated with those PLMNs. A PLMN-identity can be included only once, and in only one entry of the PLMN-ddentity/nfoList. The PLMN index is defined as \( b 1+b 2+\ldots+b(n-1)+i \) for the PLMN included at the \( n \)-th entry of PLMN-/dentity/nfoList and the \( i \)-th entry of its corresponding PLMN-Identity/nfo, where \( b(j) \) is the number of PLMN-Identity entries in each PLMN-Identity/nfo, respectively.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
snpn-AccessinfoList \\
This list provides access related information for each SNPN in npn-ldentitylnfolist, see TS 23.501 [32]. The n-th entry of the list contains the access related information of the n-th SNPN in npn-IdentitylnfoList.

extCH-Supported \\
Indicates whether the SNPN supports access using credentials from a Credentials Holder as specified in TS 23.501 [32].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
extCH-WithoutConfigAllowed \\
Indicates whether the SNPN allows registration attempts with credentials from a Credentials Holder from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN as specified in TS 23.501 [32].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
imsEmergencySupportForSNPN \\
Indicates whether the SNPN supports IMS emergency bearer services for UEs in limited service mode in the cell. If absent, IMS emergency call is not supported by the SNPN in the cell for UEs in limited service mode.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
onboardingEnabled \\
Indicates whether the onboarding SNPN allows registration for onboarding in the cell as specified in TS 23.501 [32].
