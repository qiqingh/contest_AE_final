\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PagingRecord field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
access Type \\
Indicates whether the Paging message is originated due to the PDU sessions from the non-3GPP access.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pagingRecordList \\
If the network includes pagingRecordList-v1700, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in pagingRecordList (i.e. without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pagingCause \\
Indicates whether the Paging message is originated due to IMS voice. If this field is present and upper layers indicate the support of paging cuase, it implies that the corresponding paging entry is for IMS voice. If this field is not present but pagingRecordList-v1700 is present, it implies that the corresponding paging entry is for a service other than IMS voice. Otherwise, pagingCause is undetermined.
