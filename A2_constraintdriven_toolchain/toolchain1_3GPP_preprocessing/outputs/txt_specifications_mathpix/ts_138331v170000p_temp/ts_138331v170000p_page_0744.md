\hline RadioLinkMonitoringConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamFailureDetectionTimer \\
Timer for beam failure detection (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17). See also the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig IE. Value in number of "Qout, LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection" Reference Signal (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6). Value pbfd1 corresponds to \( 1 Q_{o u t, L R} \) reporting period of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal, value pbfd2 corresponds to 2 Qout,LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
beamFailureinstanceMaxCount \\
This field determines after how many beam failure events the UE triggers beam failure recovery (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17). Value n1 corresponds to 1 beam failure instance, value n 2 corresponds to 2 beam failure instances and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList \\
A list of reference signals for detecting beam failure and/or cell level radio link failure (RLF). The limits of the reference signals that the network can configure are specified in TS 38.213 [13], table 5-1. The network configures at most two detectionResources per BWP for the purpose beamFailure or both. If no RSs are provided for the purpose of beam failure detection, the UE performs beam monitoring based on the activated TC/-State for PDCCH as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 6. If no RSs are provided in this list for the purpose of RLF detection, the UE performs Cell-RLM based on the activated TC/-State of PDCCH as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 5. The network ensures that the UE has a suitable set of reference signals for performing cell-RLM.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
failureDetectionSet1, failureDetectionSet2 \\
Configures parameters for beamfailure detection towards beam failure detection resources configured in the set. If additionalPCIList is configured for the serving cell, each RS in one set can be associted only to one PCI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RadioLinkMonitoringRS field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
detectionResource \\
A reference signal that the UE shall use for radio link monitoring or beam failure detection (depending on the indicated purpose). Only periodic 1-port CSI-RS can be configured on SCell for beam failure detection purpose.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
purpose \\
Determines whether the UE shall monitor the associated reference signal for the purpose of cell- and/or beam failure detection. For SCell, network only configures the value to beamFailure.

- RadioLinkMonitoringRS-Id

The IE RadioLinkMonitoringRS-Id is used to identify one RadioLinkMonitoringRS.
RadioLinkMonitoringRS-Id information element
-- ASNISTART
-- TAG-RADIOLINKMONITORINGRS-ID-START

RadioLinkMonitoringRS-Id := INTEGER (0. maxNrofFailureDetectionResources-1)
-- TAG-RADIOLINKMONITORINGRS-ID-STOP
-- ASNISTOP
- RAN-AreaCode

The IE RAN-AreaCode is used to identify a RAN area within the scope of a tracking area.
