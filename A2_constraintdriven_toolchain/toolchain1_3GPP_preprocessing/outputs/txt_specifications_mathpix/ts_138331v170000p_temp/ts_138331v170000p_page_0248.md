ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer segments of DL DCCH messages from the network to the UE.
NOTE: The segmentation of DL DCCH message is only applicable to RRCReconfiguration and RRCResume messages in this release.
5.7.6.2 Initiation

The network initiates the DL Dedicated Message Segment transfer procedure whenever the encoded RRC message PDU exceeds the maximum PDCP SDU size. The network initiates the DL Dedicated Message Segment transfer procedure by sending the DLDedicatedMessageSegment message.
5.7.6.3 Reception of DLDedicatedMessageSegment by the UE

Upon receiving DLDedicatedMessageSegment message, the UE shall:
1> store the segment included in rrc-MessageSegmentContainer;
1> if all segments of the message have been received:
\( 2> \) assemble the message from the received segments and process the message according to 5.3.5.3 for the RRCReconfiguration message or 5.3.13.4 for the RRCResume message;
\( 2> \) discard all segments.
5.7.7 UL message segment transfer
5.7.7.1 General

Figure 5.7.7.1-1: UL message segment transfer

The purpose of this procedure is to transfer segments of UL DCCH messages from UE to a NG-RAN in RRC_CONNECTED.

NOTE: The segmentation of UL DCCH message is only applicable to UECapabilitylnformation and MeasurementReportAppLayer in this release.
5.7.7.2 Initiation

A UE capable of UL RRC message segmentation in RRC_CONNECTED will initiate the procedure when the following conditions are met:
\( 1> \) if the RRC message segmentation is enabled based on the field \( r c \)-SegAllowed received, and
1> if the encoded RRC message is larger than the maximum supported size of a PDCP SDU specified in TS 38.323 [5];

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) initiate transmission of the ULDedicatedMessageSegment message as specified in 5.7.7.3;
