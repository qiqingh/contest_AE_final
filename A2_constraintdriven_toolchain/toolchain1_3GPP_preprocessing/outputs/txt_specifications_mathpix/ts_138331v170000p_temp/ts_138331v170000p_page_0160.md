NOTE: If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered when the UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.
5.4.3 Mobility from NR
5.4.3.1 General

Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from NR, successful

Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from NR, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using other RAT, e.g. E-UTRA, UTRA-FDD. The mobility from NR procedure covers the following type of mobility:
- handover, i.e. the MobilityFromNRCommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
5.4.3.2 Initiation

The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport or an MCGFailureInformation message, by sending a MobilityFromNRCommand message. The network applies the procedure as follows:
- the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
- the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
5.4.3.3 Reception of the MobilityFromNRCommand by the UE

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T310, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T312, if running;
1> if T316 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T316;
\( 2> \) clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
1> if T390 is running:
