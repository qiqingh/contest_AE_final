\( 5> \) include preferredK2-SCS-960kHz in the minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt IE and set it to the desired value of \( \mathrm{K}_{2} \);

3> else (if the UE has no preference on the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling for the cell group):

4> do not include preferredK0 and preferredK2 in the minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt [E;
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide a release preference according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) include releasePreference in the UEAssistanceInformation message;
\( 2> \) set preferredRRC-State to the desired RRC state on transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message;
1> if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide an indication of preference in being provisioned with reference time information according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference in being provisioned with reference time information:
\( 3> \) set referenceTimeInfoPreference to true;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set referenceTimeInfoPreference to false.
1> if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide preference on FR2 UL gap according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference for FR2 UL gap configuration:
3> set ul-GapFR2-PatternPreference to the preferred FR2 UL gap pattern;
\( 2> \) else (if the UE has no preference for the FR2 UL gap configuration):
\( 3> \) do not include ul-GapFR2-PatternPreference in the UL-GapFR2-Preference [E.
1> if transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message is initiated to provide MUSIM assistance information according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference for MUSIM periodic gap(s):
\( 3> \) include musim-GapPreferenceList with an entry for each periodic gap the UE prefers to be configured;
4> set musim-Gaplength and musim-GapRepetitionAndOffset in the musim-GapInfo [E to the values of the length and the repetition/offset of the gap(s), respectively, the UE prefers to be configured with;
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference for MUSIM aperiodic gap:
3> include the field musim-GapPreferenceList, with one entry for the aperiodic gap the UE prefers to be configured;

4> set musim-Gaplength and musim-Starting-SFN-AndSubframe in the musim-GapInfo [E to the values of respectively the length and the starting SFN/subframe of the gap, respectively, the UE prefers to be configured with;
\( 2> \) else (if the UE has no longer preference for the periodic/aperiodic gaps):
3> do not include musim-GapPreferenceList in the musim-Assistance [E;
2> if UE has a preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state:
\( 3> \) set musim-PreferredRRC-State to the preferred RRC state.
