\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BFR-CSIRS-Resource field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-RS \\
The ID of a NZP-CSI-RS-Resource configured in the CS/-MeasConfig of this serving cell. This reference signal determines a candidate beam for beam failure recovery (BFR).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-OccasionList \\
RA occasions that the UE shall use when performing BFR upon selecting the candidate beam identified by this CSI-RS. The network ensures that the RA occasion indexes provided herein are also configured by prach-Configuration/ndex and msg1-FDM. Each RACH occasion is sequentially numbered, first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions; second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot and Third, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots. \\
If the field is absent the UE uses the RA occasion associated with the SSB that is QCLed with this CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-Preambleindex \\
The RA preamble index to use in the RA occasions associated with this CSI-RS. If the field is absent, the UE uses the preamble index associated with the SSB that is QCLed with this CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline BFR-SSB-Resource field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-Preambleindex \\
The preamble index that the UE shall use when performing BFR upon selecting the candidate beams identified by this SSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb \\
The ID of an SSB transmitted by this serving cell. It determines a candidate beam for beam failure recovery (BFR).

- BeamFailureRecoverySCellConfig

The IE BeamFailureRecoverySCellConfig is used to configure the UE with candidate beams for beam failure recovery in case of beam failure detection in SCell. See also TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17.
