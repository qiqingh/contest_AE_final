- for SRB: establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell.

In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and reporting, for UE assistance (re)configuration and reporting for power savings, for IP address (re-)configuration and reporting for IAB-nodes, to (re)configure MAC, RLC, BAP, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the S-KgNB or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs associated with S-KgNB in NGEN-DC and NR-DC, and to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change configuration, provided that the (re)configuration does not require any MN involvement, and to transmit RRC messages between the MN and the UE during fast MCG link recovery. In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, only measConfig, radioBearerConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, bap-Config, iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList, otherConfig and/or secondaryCellGroup are included in RRCReconfiguration received via SRB3, except when RRCReconfiguration is received within DLInformationTransferMRDC.
5.3.5.2 Initiation

The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been activated;
- the establishment of BH RLC Channels for IAB is performed only when AS security has been activated;
- the establishment of Uu Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE is performed only when AS security has been activated;
- the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;
- the reconfiguration WithSync is included in secondaryCellGroup only when at least one RLC bearer or BH RLC channel is setup in SCG;
- the reconfiguration WithSync is included in masterCellGroup only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended;
- the conditionalReconfiguration for CPC is included only when at least one RLC bearer is setup in SCG;
- the conditionalReconfiguration for CHO or CPA is included only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended.
5.3.5.3 Reception of an \( R R C \) Reconfiguration by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the RRCReconfiguration, or upon execution of the conditional reconfiguration (CHO, CPA or CPC):
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration was received neither within mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup nor within E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration nor within E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume:
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the scg-State:
3> perform SCG deactivation as specified in 5.3.5.13b;
\( 2> \) else:
3> perform SCG activation as specified in 5.3.5.13a;
Editor's note: FFS how to ensure that the notification to MAC is only processed at the time the SCG configuration is processed, if included.

1> if the RRCReconfiguration is applied due to a conditional reconfiguration execution upon cell selection performed while timer T311 was running, as defined in 5.3.7.3:
\( 2> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 1> \) if the RRCReconfiguration includes the daps-SourceRelease:
