\( 3> \) include the field affectedCarrierFreqList with an entry for each affected carrier frequency included in candidateServingFreqListNR;
\( 3> \) for each carrier frequency included in the field affectedCarrierFreqList, include interferenceDirection and set it accordingly;
\( 2> \) if there is at least one supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies included in candidateServingFreqListNR, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself:
\( 3> \) include victimSystemType for each UL CA combination included in affectedCarrierFreqCombList;
\( 3> \) if the UE sets victimSystemType to wlan or bluetooth:
4> include affectedCarrierFreqCombList with an entry for each supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies included in candidateServingFreqListNR, that is affected by IDC problems;
\( 3> \) else:
4 optionally include affected CarrierFreq CombList with an entry for each supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies included in candidateServingFreqListNR, that is affected by IDC problems;

NOTE 1: When sending an UEAssistancelnformation message to inform the IDC problems, the UE includes all IDC assistance information (rather than providing e g the changed part(s) of the IDC assistance information).

NOTE 2: Upon not anymore experiencing a particular IDC problem that the UE previously reported, the UE provides an IDC indication with the modified contents of the UEAssistanceInformation message (e.g. by not including the IDC assistance information in the idc-Assistance field).
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide drx-Preference of a cell group for power saving according to 5.7 .4 .2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) include dr \( x \)-Preference in the UEAssistanceInformation message;
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on DRX parameters for the cell group:
\( 3> \) if the UE has a preference for the long DRX cycle:
4 include preferredDRX-LongCycle in the DRX-Preference IE and set it to the preferred value;
\( 3> \) if the UE has a preference for the DRX inactivity timer:
\( 4> \) include preferredDRX-InactivityTimer in the DRX-Preference IE and set it to the preferred value;
\( 3> \) if the UE has a preference for the short DRX cycle:
\( 4> \) include preferredDRX-ShortCycle in the DRX-Preference IE and set it to the preferred value;
\( 3> \) if the UE has a preference for the short DRX timer:
4 include preferredDRX-ShortCycleTimer in the DRX-Preference IE and set it to the preferred value;
\( 2> \) else (if the UE has no preference on DRX parameters for the cell group):
\( 3> \) do not include preferredDRX-LongCycle, preferredDRX-InactivityTimer, preferredDRX-ShortCycle and preferredDRX-ShortCycleTimer in the DRX-Preference IE;
\( 1> \) if transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message is initiated to provide maxB W -Preference of a cell group for power saving according to 5.7.4.2 or 5.3.5.3:
\( 2> \) include maxBW-Preference in the UEAssistanceInformation message;
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the maximum aggregated bandwidth for the cell group:
\( 3> \) if the UE prefers to reduce the maximum aggregated band width of FR1:
