3> if measConfigAppLayerContainer is included for the corresponding MeasConfigAppLayer configuration:
\( 4> \) forward the measConfigAppLayerContainer, the measConfigAppLayerId and the serviceType to upper layers considering the serviceType;

3> consider itself to be configured to send application layer measurement report for the measConfigAppLayerId in accordance with 5.7.16;

3> forward the transmissionOfSessionStartStop, if received, to upper layers;
3> if ran-VisibleParameters is set to setup and the parameters have been received;
\( 4> \) forward the measConfigAppLayerId, the ran-VisiblePeriodicity, the numberOfBufferLevelEntries and the reportInitialPlayOutDelay to upper layers considering the serviceType;

3> else if ran-VisibleParameters is set to release:
4> forward the measConfigAppLayerId and inform upper layers about the release of the RAN visible application layer measurement configuration;
\( 3> \) if pauseReporting is set to true:
4> if at least one segment, but not all segments, of a segmented MeasurementReportAppLayer message containing an application layer measurement report associated with the measConfigAppLayerId has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:

5> submit the remaining segments of the MeasurementReportAppLayer message to lower layers for transmission;
\( 4> \) suspend submitting application layer measurement report containers to lower layers for the application layer measurement configuration associated with the measConfigAppLayerId;

4> store any previously or subsequently received application layer measurement report containers associated with the measConfigAppLayerId for which no segment, or full message, has been submitted to lower layers for transmission;

3> else if pauseReporting is set to false and if transmission of application layer measurement report containers has previously been suspended for the application layer measurement configuration associated with the measConfigAppLayerId:
\( 4> \) submit stored application layer measurement report containers to lower layers for the application layer measurements configuration associated with the measConfigAppLayerId;

4> resume submitting application layer measurement report containers to lower layers for the application layer measurement configuration associated with the measConfigAppLayerId;

NOTE 1: The UE may discard reports when the memory reserved for storing application layer measurement reports becomes full.

NOTE 2: The transmission of RAN visible reports is not paused when pauseReporting is set to true.
5.3.5.14 Sidelink dedicated configuration

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-FreqInfoToReleaseList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) for each entry included in the received \( s \) /-FreqInfoToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration:
\( 3> \) release the related configurations from the stored NR sidelink communication configurations;
\( 1> \) if \( s \) l-FreqInfoToAddModList is included in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration:
\( 2> \) if configured to receive NR sidelink communication:
