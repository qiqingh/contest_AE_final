NOTE: The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted \( S I B 1 \) if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located.
5.2.2.3.2 Acquisition of an SI message

For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined according to searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIBI where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the SI window. The \( [\mathrm{x} \times \mathrm{N}+\mathrm{K}]^{\text {th }} \) PDCCH monitoring occasion (s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the \( K^{\text {th }} \) transmitted SSB, where \( x=0,1, \ldots X-1, K=1,2, \ldots N, N \) is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE implementation.

When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1> determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as follows:
\( 2> \) if the concerned SI message is configured in the schedulingInfoList:
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number \( n \) which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
\( 3> \) determine the integer value \( x=(n-1) \times w \), where \( w \) is the si-WindowLength;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot \#a, where \( a=x \bmod \mathrm{~N} \), in the radio frame for which SFN \( \bmod T= \) FLOOR \( (x / \mathrm{N}) \), where \( T \) is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 2> \) else if the concerned SI message is configured in the schedulingInfoList2;
\( 3> \) determine the integer value \( x=( \) si -WindowPosition -1\( ) \times w \), where \( w \) is the si-WindowLength;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot \#a, where \( a=x \bmod \mathrm{~N} \), in the radio frame for which SFN \( \bmod T= \) FLOOR \( (x / \mathrm{N}) \), where \( T \) is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 2> \) else if the concerned SI message is configured in the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is not configured:
\( 3> \) create a concatenated list of SI messages by appending the posSchedulingInfoList in posSI-SchedulingInfo in SIBI to schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIBI;

3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number \( n \) which corresponds to the order of entry in the concatenated list;
\( 3> \) determine the integer value \( x=(n-1) \times w \), where \( w \) is the si-WindowLength;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot \#a, where \( a=x \bmod \mathrm{~N} \), in the radio frame for which SFN \( \bmod T= \) FLOOR( \( x / \mathrm{N} \) ), where \( T \) is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
\( 2> \) else if the concerned SI message is configured by the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is configured:

3> determine the number \( m \) which corresponds to the number of SI messages with an associated siPeriodicity of 8 radio frames ( 80 ms ), configured by schedulingInfoList in SIBI;
