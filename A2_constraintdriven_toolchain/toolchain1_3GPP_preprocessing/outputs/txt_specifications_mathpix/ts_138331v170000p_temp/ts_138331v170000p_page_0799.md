\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline ServingCellConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
additionalPCIList \\
List of timing information for the additional SSB with different PCI than serving cell PCI .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bwp-InactivityTimer \\
The duration in ms after which the UE falls back to the default Bandwidth Part (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15). When the network releases the timer configuration, the UE stops the timer without switching to the default BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ca-SlotOffset \\
Slot offset between the primary cell (PCell/PSCell) and the SCell in unaligned frame boundary with slot alignment and partial SFN alignment inter-band CA. Based on this field, the UE determines the time offset of the SCell as specified in clause 4.5 of TS 38.211 [16]. The granularity of this field is determined by the reference SCS for the slot offset (i.e. the maximum of PCell/PSCell lowest SCS among all the configured SCSs in DLUL SCS-SpecificCarrierList in ServingCellConfigCommon or \\
ServingCellConfigCommonSIB and this serving cell's lowest SCS among all the configured SCSs in DLUL SCS-SpecificCarrierList in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB). \\
The Network configures at most single non-zero offset duration in ms (independent on SCS) among CCs in the unaligned CA configuration. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value of 0 . The slot offset value can only be changed with SCell release and add.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cbg-TxDiffTBsProcessingType1, cbg-TxDiffTBsProcessingType2 \\
Indicates whether processing types 1 and 2 based CBG based operation is enabled according to Rel-16 UE capabilities.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelAccessConfig \\
List of parameters used for access procedures of operation with shared spectrum channel access (see TS 37.213 [48).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
channelAccessMode2 \\
If present, this field indicates that the UE shall apply channel access mode procedures for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4 for FR2-2. If absent, the UE does not apply these channel access procedures. \\
Overwrites the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB for this serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
crossCarrierSchedulingConfig \\
Indicates whether this serving cell is cross-carrier scheduled by another serving cell or whether it cross-carrier schedules another serving cell. If the field other is configured for an SpCell (i.e., the SpCell is cross-carrier scheduled by another serving cell), the SpCell can be additionally scheduled by the PDCCH on the SpCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
crs-RateMatch-PerCORESETPoolindex \\
Indicates how UE performs rate matching when both lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 are configured as specified in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-RS-ValidationWithDCI \\
Indicates how the UE performs periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS reception in a slot. The presence of this field indicates that the UE uses DCI detection to validate whether to receive CSI-RS (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
defauitDownlinkBWP-id \\
The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id \( =0 \). ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon expiry of the BWP inactivity timer. This field is UE specific. When the field is absent the UE uses the initial BWP as default BWP. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12 and TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
directiona/CollisionHandling \\
Indicates that this serving cell is using directional collision handling between a reference and other cell(s) for half-duplex operation in TDD CA with same SCS as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1. The half-duplex operation only applies within the same frequency range and cell group. \\
For the IAB-MT, it also indicates that this serving cell is using directional collision handling between a reference and other cell(s) for half-duplex operation in TDD NR-DC with same SCS within same cell group or cross different cell groups. \\
The network only configures this field for TDD serving cells that are using the same SCS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dormantBWP-Config \\
The dormant BWP configuration for an SCell. This field can be configured only for a (non-PUCCH) SCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkBWP-ToAddModList \\
List of additional downlink bandwidth parts to be added or modified. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkBWP-ToReleaseList \\
List of additional downlink bandwidth parts to be released. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
