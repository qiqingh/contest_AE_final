\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SpCellConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deactivated-SCG-Config \\
Configuration applicable when the SCG is deactivated. The network always configures this field before or when indicating that the SCG is deactivated in an RRCReconfiguration, RRCResume, E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration or E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
goodServingCellEvaluationBFD \\
Indicates the criterion for a UE to detect the good serving cell quality for BFD relaxation in the SpCell in RRC_CONNECTED. The field is always configured when the network enables BFD relaxation for the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
goodServingCellEvaluationRLM \\
Indicates the criterion for a UE to detect the good serving cell quality for RLM relaxation in the SpCell in RRC_CONNECTED. The field is always configured when the network enables RLM relaxation for the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
lowMobilityEvaluationConnected \\
Indicates the criterion for a UE to detect low mobility in RRC_CONNECTED in an SpCell. The \( s \)-SearchDeltaP-Connected is the parameter "SsearchDeltaP-connected". And the \( t \) -SearchDeltaP-Connected is the parameter " TsearcheltaP-connected". Low mobility criterion is configured in NR Pcell for the case of NR SA/NR CA/NE-DC/NR-DC, and in the NR PSCell for the case of EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reconfigurationWithSync \\
Parameters for the synchronous reconfiguration to the target SpCell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
If-TimersAndConstants \\
Timers and constants for detecting and triggering cell-level radio link failure. For the SCG, rif-TimersAndConstants can only be set to setup and is always included at SCG addition.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
servCellindex \\
Serving cell ID of a PSCell. The PCell of the Master Cell Group uses ID \( =0 \).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-PathSwitchConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
targetRelayUEldentity \\
Indicates the L2 source ID of the target L2 U2N Relay UE during path switch.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
T420 \\
Indicates the timer value of T420 to be used during during path switch.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
