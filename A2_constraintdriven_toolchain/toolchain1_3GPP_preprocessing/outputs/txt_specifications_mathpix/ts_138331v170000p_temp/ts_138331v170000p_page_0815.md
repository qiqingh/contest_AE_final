\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Schedulinginfo2 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
encrypted \\
The presence of this field indicates that the pos-sib-type is encrypted as specified in TS 37.355 [49].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gnss-id \\
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific GNSS. Indicates a specific GNSS (see also TS 37.355 [49])
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSibType \\
The posSIBs as defined in TS 37.355 [49] mapped to SI for scheduling using schedulinginfoList2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sbas-id \\
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific SBAS. Indicates a specific SBAS (see also TS 37.355 [49]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-WindowPosition \\
This field indicates the SI window position of the associated SI-message. The network provides si-WindowPosition in an ascending order, i.e. si-WindowPosition in the subsequent entry in scheduling/nfoList2 has always value higher than in the previous entry of schedulinginfoList2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sib-Mappinginfo \\
Indicates which SIBs or posSIBs are contained in the SI message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
type1, type2 \\
The SIBs/posSIBs mapped to SI for scheduling using scheduling/nfoList2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional presence & Explanation \\
\hline MSG-1 & The field is optionally present, Need R, if si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting for any SI-message included in SchedulingInfo. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline SIB-TYPE & The field is mandatory present if the SIB type is different from SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8. For SIB6, SIB7 and SIB8 it is absent. \\
\hline SIB-TYPE-POS & The field is mandatory present if the SIB type is type1. For type2 it is absent. \\
\hline SUL-MSG-1 & The field is optionally present, Need R, if supplementaryUplink is configured in ServingCellConfigCommonS/B and if si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting for any SI-message included in SchedulingInfo. It is absent otherwise. \\

- SK-Counter

The IE \( S K \)-Counter is a counter used upon initial configuration of SN security for NR-DC and NE-DC, as well as upon refresh of S-KgNB or S-KenB based on the current or newly derived \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) during RRC Resume or RRC Reconfiguration, as defined in TS 33.501 [11].

- SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell

The IE SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell is used to configure the SlotFormatCombinations applicable for one serving cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.1).
