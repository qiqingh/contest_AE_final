For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink messages, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need \( R \) child fields are released, Need \( M \) child fields are not modified and the actions for Need \( S \) child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink messages without need codes where this rule applies are:
- nonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism,
- groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and
- non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
```
-- /example/ ASN1START
```


SEQUENCE 1

SEQUENCE 1
```
RRCMessage-IEs ::=
    fieldl
    field2
    nonCriticalExtension
}
RRCMessage-1570-IEs ::=
    field3
    nonCriticalExtension
}
RRCMessage-vl640-IEs ::=
    field4
    nonCriticalExtension
}
InformationElementl ::=
    fieldll
    fieldl2
    ...;
    [ [
    fieldl3
    fieldl4
    ]]
}
InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE \
    field2l
    ...
}
-- ASNISTOP
```

```
InformationElementl OPTIONAL, -- Need M
InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
RRCMessage-vl570-IEs OPTIONAL
```


InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
```
RRCMessage-vl640-IEs OPTIONAL
SEQUENCE \
InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

InformationElementll
InformationElementl2

InformationElementl4
OPTIONAL, -- Need. M
OPTIONAL, -- Need. R
OPTIONAL, -- Need. R

```


The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
- if fieldl in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify any child fields configured within fieldl (regardless of their need codes);
