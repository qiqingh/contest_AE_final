\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PosSI-Schedulinginfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
areaScope \\
Indicates that a posSIB is area specific. If the field is absent, the posSIB is cell specific.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
encrypted \\
The presence of this field indicates that the pos-sib-type is encrypted as specified in TS 37.355 [49].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gnss-id \\
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific GNSS. Indicates a specific GNSS (see also TS 37.355 [49])
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSI-BroadcastStatus \\
Indicates if the SI message is being broadcasted or not. Change of posSI-BroadcastStatus should not result in system information change notifications in Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). The value of the indication is valid until the end of the BCCH modification period when set to broadcasting.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSI-RequestConfig \\
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which posS/-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSI-RequestConfigSUL \\
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSIB-Mappinginfo \\
List of the posSIBs mapped to this Systeminformation message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSibType \\
The positioning SIB type is defined in TS 37.355 [49].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
posSI-Periodicity \\
Periodicity of the SI-message in radio frames, such that rf8 denotes 8 radio frames, rf16 denotes 16 radio frames, and so on. If the offsetToS/Used is configured, the posS/Periodicity of rf8 cannot be used.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
offsetToSI-Used \\
This field, if present indicates that all the SI messages in posScheduling/nfoList are scheduled with an offset of 8 radio frames compared to SI messages in schedulinginfoList. offsetToS/-Used may be present only if the shortest configured SI message periodicity for SI messages in scheduling/nfoList is 80 ms . If SI offset is used, this field is present in each of the SI messages in the posSchedulinginfoList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sbas-id \\
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific SBAS. Indicates a specific SBAS (see also TS 37.355 [49]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
