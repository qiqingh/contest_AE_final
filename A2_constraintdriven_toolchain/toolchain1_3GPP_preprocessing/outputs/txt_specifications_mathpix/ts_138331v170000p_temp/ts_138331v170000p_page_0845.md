\hline QCL-info field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bwp-id \\
The DL BWP which the RS is located in.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cell \\
The UE's serving cell in which the referenceSignal is configured. If the field is absent, it applies to the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured. The RS can be located on a serving cell other than the serving cell in which the TC/-State is configured only if the qc/-Type is configured as typeC or typeD. See TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
referenceSignal \\
Reference signal with which quasi-collocation information is provided as specified in TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5.
\end{tabular} \\

qci-Type \\
QCL type as specified in TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.5.
