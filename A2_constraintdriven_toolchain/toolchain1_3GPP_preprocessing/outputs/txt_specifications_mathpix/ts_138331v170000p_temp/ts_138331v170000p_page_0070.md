4> if available, set the bt-LocationInfo to include the Bluetooth measurement results, in order of decreasing RSSI for Bluetooth beacons;

4> if available, set the wlan-LocationInfo to include the WLAN measurement results, in order of decreasing RSSI for WLAN APs;

4> if available, set the sensor-LocationInfo to include the sensor measurement results as follows;
\( 5> \) if available, include the sensor-MeasurementInformation;
\( 5> \) if available, include the sensor-MotionInformation;
NOTE 3: Which location information related configuration is used by the UE to make the locationInfo available for inclusion in the VarConnEstFailReport is left to UE implementation.

3> set perRAInfoList to indicate the performed random access procedure related information as specified in 5.7.10.5;

3> if the numberOfConnFail is smaller than 8 :
4> increment the numberOfConnFail by 1;
\( 2> \) inform upper layers about the failure to establish the RRC connection, upon which the procedure ends;
The UE may discard the connection establishment failure or connection resume failure information, i.e. release the UE variable VarConnEstFailReport, 48 hours after the last connection establishment failure is detected.

The L2 U2N Relay UE either triggers PC5-S release or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 5.8.9.10.
5.3.3.8 Abortion of RRC connection establishment

If upper layers abort the RRC connection establishment procedure, due to a NAS procedure being aborted as specified in TS 24.501 [23], while the UE has not yet entered RRC_CONNECTED, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T300, if running;
1> reset MAC, release the MAC configuration and re-establish RLC for all RBs that are established.
