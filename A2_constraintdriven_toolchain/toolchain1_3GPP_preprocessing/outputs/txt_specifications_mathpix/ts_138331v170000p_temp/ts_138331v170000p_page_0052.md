\( 4> \) apply the first listed additionalSpectrumEmission which it supports among the values included in \( N R \) -NS-PmaxList within frequencyBandList in uplinkConfigCommon for FDD or in downlinkConfigCommon for TDD;

4> if the additionalPmax is present in the same entry of the selected additionalSpectrumEmission within NR-NS-PmaxList:
\( 5> \) apply the additionalPmax for UL;
4> else:
\( 5> \) apply the \( p \)-Max in uplinkConfigCommon for UL;
4> if supplementaryUplink is present in servingCellConfigCommon; and
4> if the UE supports one or more of the frequency bands indicated in the frequencyBandList for the supplementaryUplink; and

4> if the UE supports at least one additionalSpectrumEmission in the NR-NS-PmaxList for a supported supplementary uplink band; and

4> if the UE supports an uplink channel bandwidth with a maximum transmission bandwidth configuration (see TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39]) which
- is smaller than or equal to the carrierBandwidth (indicated in supplementaryUplink for the SCS of the initial uplink BWP), and which
- is wider than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP of the SUL:
\( 5> \) consider supplementary uplink as configured in the serving cell;
\( 5> \) select the first frequency band in the frequencyBandList for the supplementaryUplink which the UE supports and for which the UE supports at least one of the additionalSpectrumEmission values in nr-NS-PmaxList, if present;
\( 5> \) apply a supported supplementary uplink channel bandwidth with a maximum transmission bandwidth which
- is contained within the carrierBandwidth (indicated in supplementaryUplink for the SCS of the initial uplink BWP), and which
- is wider than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial BWP of the SUL;
\( 5> \) apply the first listed additionalSpectrumEmission which it supports among the values included in NR-NS-PmaxList within frequencyBandList for the supplementaryUplink;
\( 5> \) if the additionalPmax is present in the same entry of the selected additionalSpectrumEmission within NR-NS-PmaxList for the supplementaryUplink:

6> apply the additionalPmax in supplementaryUplink for SUL;
5> else:
6> apply the p-Max in supplementaryUplink for SUL;
\( 2> \) else:
3> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 [20]; and
\( 3> \) perform barring as if intraFreqReselection is set to notAllowed;
