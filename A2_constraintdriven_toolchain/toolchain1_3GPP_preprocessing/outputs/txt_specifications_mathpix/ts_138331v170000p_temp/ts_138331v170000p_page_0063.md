5.3.3 RRC connection establishment
5.3.3.1 General

Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject

The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/message from the UE to the network.

The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:
- When establishing an RRC connection;
- When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case, UE receives RRCSetup and responds with RRCSetupComplete.
5.3.3.1a Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for NR sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication

For NR sidelink communication/discovery, an RRC connection establishment is initiated only in the following cases:
\( 1> \) if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery and related data is available for transmission:
\( 2> \) if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in \( s l \) FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency; or
\( 2> \) if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink discovery is included in \( s l \) FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-DiscTxPoolSelected or sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency;

For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_IDLE, an RRC connection establishment is initiated in the following cases:
