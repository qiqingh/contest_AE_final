\( 3> \) acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> else:
\( 2> \) apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIBI;
\( 2> \) apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
\( 2> \) apply the timeAlignmentTimerCommon included in SIB1;
\( 2> \) apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;
\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the RRCSystemInfoRequest message in accordance with 5.2.2.3.4;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for RRCSystemInfoRequest message is received from lower layers:
\( 3> \) acquire the requested \( S I \) message( \( s \) ) as defined in clause 5.2 .2 .3 .2 , immediately;
\( 1> \) if cell reselection occurs while waiting for the acknowledgment for SI request from lower layers:
\( 2>\operatorname{reset} \mathrm{MAC} \);
\( 2> \) if SI request is based on RRCSystemInfoRequest message:
\( 3> \) release RLC entity for SRBO.
NOTE: After RACH failure for SI request it is up to UE implementation when to retry the SI request.
5.2.2.3.3a Request for on demand positioning system information

The UE shall, while T319a is not running:
\( 1> \) if SIBI includes posSI-SchedulingInfo containing posSI-RequestConfigSUL and criteria to select supplementary uplink as defined in TS 38.321[13], clause 5.1.1 is met:
\( 2> \) trigger the lower layer to initiate the Random Access procedure on supplementary uplink in accordance with [3] using the PRACH preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in posS/-RequestConfigSUL corresponding to the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:
\( 3> \) acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> else if SIBI includes posS/-SchedulingInfo containing posSI-RequestConfig and criteria to select normal uplink as defined in TS 38.321[13], clause 5.1.1 is met:
\( 2> \) trigger the lower layer to initiate the random access procedure on normal uplink in accordance with TS 38.321 [3] using the PRACH preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in posSI-RequestConfig corresponding to the SI message(s) that the UE upper layers require for positioning operations, and for which posSIBroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:
\( 3> \) acquire the requested \( S I \) message( \( s \) ) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> else:
\( 2> \) apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIBI;
\( 2> \) apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
\( 2> \) apply the timeAlignmentTimerCommon included in SIBI;
\( 2> \) apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;
