\( 2> \) reconfigure the MAC main configuration of the cell group in accordance with the received macCellGroupConfig excluding tag-ToReleaseList and tag-ToAddModList;
\( 1> \) if the received mac-CellGroupConfig includes the tag-ToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) for each \( T A G-I d \) value included in the tag-ToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration:
\( 3> \) release the TAG indicated by TAG-Id;
\( 1> \) if the received mac-CellGroupConfig includes the tag-ToAddModList:
⇒ for each tag-Id value included in tag-ToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (TAG addition):
\( 3> \) add the TAG, corresponding to the \( t a g-I d \), in accordance with the received timeAlignmentTimer;
\( 2> \) for each \( t a g \)-Id value included in tag-ToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration (TAG modification):
\( 3> \) reconfigure the TAG, corresponding to the \( t a g-I d \), in accordance with the received timeAlignmentTimer.
5.3.5.5.6 RLF Timers \& Constants configuration

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the received rff-TimersAndConstants is set to release:
\( 2> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 3> \) use values for timers \( \mathrm{T} 301, \mathrm{~T} 310, \mathrm{~T} 311 \) and constants \( \mathrm{N} 310, \mathrm{~N} 311 \) for the target cell group, as included in ue-TimersAndConstants received in SIBI;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) use values for timers \( \mathrm{T} 301, \mathrm{~T} 310, \mathrm{~T} 311 \) and constants \( \mathrm{N} 310, \mathrm{~N} 311 \), as included in ueTimersAndConstants received in SIB1;

1> else:
\( 2> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 3> \) configure the value of timers and constants for the target cell group in accordance with received \( n f \) TimersAndConstants;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) (re-)configure the value of timers and constants in accordance with received Iff-TimersAndConstants;
\( 3> \) stop timer T310 for this cell group, if running;
\( 3> \) stop timer T312 for this cell group, if running;
3> reset the counters N310 and N311.
5.3.5.5.7 SpCell Configuration

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via the PC5-RRC connection (i.e the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) use values for timers T300, T301 and T319 as included in ue-TimersAndConstants-RemoteUE received in SIBl;
\( 2> \) use value for timers T311, as included in ue-TimersAndConstants received in SIB1;
1> else
