ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

\( 2> \) release scg-DeactivationPreferenceConfig, if configured, and stop timer T346i, if running;
1> release successHO-Config, if configured;
\( 1> \) if any DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 2> \) reset the source MAC and release the source MAC configuration;
\( 2> \) for each DAPS bearer:
3> release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the source SpCell;

3> reconfigure the PDCP entity to release DAPS as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) for each SRB:
3> release the PDCP entity for the source SpCell;
3> release the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4], clause 5.1.3, and the associated logical channel for the source SpCell;
\( 2> \) release the physical channel configuration for the source SpCell;
\( 2> \) discard the keys used in the source SpCell (the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { int }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the \( K_{\text {UPenc }} \) key), if any;
\( 1> \) release \( s \) /-L2RelayUEConfig, if configured;
\( 1> \) release \( s \) /-L2RemoteUEConfig, if configured;
\( 1> \) release the SRAP entity, if configured;
1> if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via PC5-RRC connection (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) if the PC5-RRC connection with the U2N Relay UE is determined to be released:
\( 3> \) perform the PC5-RRC connection release as specified in 5.8.9.5;
3> perform either cell selection in accordance with the cell selection process as specified in TS 38.304 [20], or relay selection as specified in clause 5.8.15.3, or both;
\( 2> \) else maintain the PC5 RRC connection and stop T311 if running;
NOTE 1: It is up to Remote UE implementation whether to release or keep the current unicast PC5 link.
1> else:
\( 2> \) perform cell selection in accordance with the cell selection process as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
NOTE 2: For L2 U2N Remote UE, if both a suitable cell and a suitable relay are available, the UE can select either one based on its implementation.
5.3.7.3 Actions following cell selection while T311 is running

Upon selecting a suitable NR cell, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2;
\( 1> \) stop timer T311;
1> if T390 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T390 for all access categories;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
