\( 2> \) if tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon is included in the received SIB1:
3> set sl-TDD-Config to the value representing the same meaning as that is included in \( t d d \)-UL-DLConfigurationCommon, as described in TS 38.213, clause 16.1 [13];
\( 2> \) else:
3> set sl-TDD-Config to the value as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 16.1;
\( 2> \) if syncInfoReserved is included in an entry of configured sl-SyncConfigList corresponding to the concerned frequency from the received SIB12:

3> set reservedBits to the value of syncInfoReserved in the received SIB12;
\( 2> \) else:
3> set all bits in reservedBits to 0;
1> else if out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication as defined in TS 38.304 [20]; and the concerned frequency is included in sl-FreqInfoToAddModList in RRCReconfiguration or in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12:
\( 2> \) set inCoverage to true;
\( 2> \) set reservedBits to the value of the corresponding field included in the preconfigured sidelink parameters (i.e. sl-PreconfigGeneral in SidelinkPreconfigNR defined in 9.3);
\( 2> \) set sl-TDD-Config to the value representing the same meaning as that is included in the corresponding field included in the preconfigured sidelink parameters (i.e. \( s l \)-PreconfigGeneral in SL-PreconfigurationNR defined in 9.3) as described in TS 38.213, clause 16.1 [13];
\( 1> \) else if out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication as defined in TS 38.304 [20]; and the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference and sl-SSB-TimeAllocation3 is not configured for the frequency used in SidelinkPreconfigNR:
\( 2> \) set inCoverage to true;
\( 2> \) set reservedBits to the value of the corresponding field included in the preconfigured sidelink parameters (i.e. sl-PreconfigGeneral in SidelinkPreconfigNR defined in 9.3);

\( 1> \) else if the UE has a selected SyncRef UE (as defined in 5.8.6):
\( 2> \) set inCoverage to false;
\( 2> \) set sl-TDD-Config and reservedBits to the value of the corresponding field included in the received MasterInformationBlockSidelink;

1> else:
\( 2> \) set inCoverage to false;
\( 2> \) set reservedBits to the value of the corresponding field included in the preconfigured sidelink parameters (i.e. sl-PreconfigGeneral in SidelinkPreconfigNR defined in 9.3);
\( 2> \) set \( s \) /-TDD-Config to the value representing the same meaning as that is included in the corresponding field included in the preconfigured sidelink parameters (i.e. sl-PreconfigGeneral in SL-PreconfigurationNR defined in 9.3) as described in TS 38.213, clause 16.1 [13];
\( 1> \) set directFrameNumber and slotIndex according to the slot used to transmit the SLSS, as specified in 5.8.5.3;
1> submit the MasterInformationBlockSidelink to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends;
