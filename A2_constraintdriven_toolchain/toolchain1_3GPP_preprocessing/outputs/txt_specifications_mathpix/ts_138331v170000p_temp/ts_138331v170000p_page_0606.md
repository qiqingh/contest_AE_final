\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
refFreqCSI-RS \\
Point A which is used for mapping of CSI-RS to physical resources according to TS 38.211 [16] clause 7.4.1.5.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc1 \\
Primary measurement timing configuration. (see clause 5.5.2.10).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc2 \\
Secondary measurement timing configuration for SS corresponding to this MeasObjectNR with PCI listed in pci-List. For these SS, the periodicity is indicated by periodicity in smtc2 and the timing offset is equal to the offset indicated in periodicityAndOffset modulo periodicity. periodicity in smtc2 can only be set to a value strictly shorter than the periodicity indicated by periodicityAndOffset in smtc1 (e.g. if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf10, periodicity can only be set of sf5, if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf5, smtc2 cannot be configured).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc3list \\
Measurement timing configuration list for SS corresponding to IAB-MT. This is used for the IAB-node's discovery of other IAB-nodes and the IAB-Donor-DUs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
smtc4List \\
Measurement timing configuration list for NTN deployments. Details FFS. FFS whether smtc1 or smtc2 can be configured with this.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssbFrequency \\
Indicates the frequency of the SS associated to this MeasObjectNR. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, this field is a k*30 kHz shift from the sync raster where \( \mathrm{k}=0,1,2 \), and so on if the reportType within the corresponding ReportConfigNR is set to reportCGI (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1). Frequencies are considered to be on the sync raster if they are also identifiable with a GSCN value (see TS 38.101-1 [15]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssb-PositionQCL-Common \\
Indicates the QCL relationship between SS/PBCH blocks for all measured cells as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ssbSubcarrierSpacing \\
Subcarrier spacing of SSB. \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15 or 30 kHz \\
FR2-1: 120 or 240 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t312 \\
The value of timer T312. Value ms0 represents 0 ms , ms50 represents 50 ms and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
