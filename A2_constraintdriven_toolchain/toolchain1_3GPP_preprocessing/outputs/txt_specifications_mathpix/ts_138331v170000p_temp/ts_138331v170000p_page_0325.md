- if field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field2 1);
- if fieldl or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
- if field I in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field 13 and field 14 is absent, the UE releases field 13 but does not modify field 14 ;
- if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;
6.1.3 General rules

In the ASN. 1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.
Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure, the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the UE configuration before applying the received list and shall consider each entry as newly created. This applies also to lists whose size is extended (i.e. with a second list structure in the ASN. 1 comprising additional entries), unless otherwise specified. This implies that Need M should not be used for fields in the entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such fields equivalent to a Need R
