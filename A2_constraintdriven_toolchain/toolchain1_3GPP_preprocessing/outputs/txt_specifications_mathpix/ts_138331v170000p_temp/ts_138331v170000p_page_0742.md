\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline RBTermChange & \begin{tabular}{l}
The field is mandatory present in case of: \\
- set up of signalling and data radio bearer, \\
- change of termination point for the radio bearer between MN and SN . \\
It is optionally present otherwise, Need S.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline RBTermChange 1 & \begin{tabular}{l}
The field is mandatory present in case of: \\
- set up of signalling and data radio bearer, \\
- change of termination point for the radio bearer between MN and SN , \\
- handover from E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC to NR, \\
- handover from NR or E-UTRA/EPC to E-UTRA/5GC if the UE supports NGEN-DC. \\
It is optionally present otherwise, Need S.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline PDCP & The field is mandatory present if the corresponding DRB/multicast MRB is being setup or corresponding DRB/multicast MRB is reconfigured with NR PDCP or corresponding SRB associated with two RLC entities is being setup or if the number of RLC bearers associated with the DRB/multicast MRB or SRB is changed. The field is optionally present, Need S, if the corresponding SRB associated with one RLC entity is being setup or corresponding SRB is reconfigured with NR PDCP; otherwise the field is optionally present, need M. \\
\hline DRBSetup & The field is mandatory present if the corresponding DRB is being setup; otherwise the field is optionally present, need M. \\
\hline HO-Conn & \begin{tabular}{l}
The field is mandatory present \\
- in case of inter-system handover from E-UTRA/EPC to E-UTRA/5GC or NR, \\
- or when the fullConfig is included in the RRCReconfiguration message and NE-DC/NR-DC is not configured, \\
- or in case of RRCSetup. \\
Otherwise the field is optionally present, need N . \\
Upon RRCSetup, only SRB1 can be present.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline HO-toNR & \begin{tabular}{l}
If mrb-ToAddModList is not included, the field is mandatory present \\
- in case of inter-system handover from E-UTRA/EPC to E-UTRA/5GC or NR, \\
- or when the fullConfig is included in the RRCReconfiguration message and NE-DC/NR-DC is not configured. In case of RRCSetup, the field is absent; otherwise the field is optionally present, need N .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline DAPS & The field is optionally present, need N, in case masterCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync, SCell(s) and SCG are not configured, multi-DCl/single-DCI based multi-TRP are not configured in any DL BWP, supplementaryUplink is not configured, ethernetHeaderCompression is not configured for the DRB, conditionalReconfiguration for CHO is not configured, and NR sidelink and V2X sidelink are not configured. Otherwise the field is absent. \\
\hline MRBSetup & The field is mandatory present if the corresponding multicast MRB is being setup; otherwise the field is optionally present, need M. \\

- RadioLinkMonitoringConfig

The IE RadioLinkMonitoringConfig is used to configure radio link monitoring for detection of beam- and/or cell radio link failure. See also TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1.
