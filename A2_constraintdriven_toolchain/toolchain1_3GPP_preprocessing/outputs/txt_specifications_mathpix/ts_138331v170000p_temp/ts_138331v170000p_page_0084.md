ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

specified in TS 36.331 [10]. The network provides the configuration parameters for a cell group in the CellGroupConfig IE.

The UE performs the following actions based on a received CellGroupConfig IE:
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the spCellConfig with reconfigurationWithSync:
\( 2> \) perform Reconfiguration with sync according to 5.3.5.5.2;
\( 2> \) resume all suspended radio bearers except the SRBs for the source cell group, and resume SCG transmission for all radio bearers, and resume BH RLC channels and resume SCG transmission for BH RLC channels for [AB-MT, if suspended;

NOTE: If the SCG is deactivated, resuming SCG transmission for all radio bearers does not imply that PDCP PDUs can be transmitted or received on SCG RLC bearers.
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the rlc-BearerToReleaseList or rlc-BearerToReleaseListExt:
\( 2> \) perform RLC bearer release as specified in 5.3.5.5.3;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the rlc-BearerToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform the RLC bearer addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.5.4;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the mac-CellGroupConfig:
\( 2> \) configure the MAC entity of this cell group as specified in 5.3.5.5.5;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the sCellToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) perform SCell release as specified in 5.3.5.5.8;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the spCellConfig:
\( 2> \) configure the SpCell as specified in 5.3.5.5.7;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the sCellToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform SCell addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.5.9;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the bh-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) perform BH RLC channel release as specified in 5.3.5.5.10;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the bh-RLC-ChannelToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform the BH RLC channel addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.5.11;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelToReleaseList:
\( 2> \) perform Uu Relay RLC channel release as specified in 5.3.5.5.12;
\( 1> \) if the CellGroupConfig contains the uu-Relay-RLC-ChannelToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform the Uu Relay RLC channel addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.5.13;
5.3.5.5.2 Reconfiguration with sync

The UE shall perform the following actions to execute a reconfiguration with sync.
\( 1> \) if the AS security is not activated, perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3 .11 with the release cause 'other' upon which the procedure ends;
\( 1> \) if no DAPS bearer is configured:
\( 2> \) stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;
\( 1> \) if this procedure is executed for the MCG:
