\( 4- \) if SRS carrier switching is supported;
\( 5> \) include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR and srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA for each band combination;
4> set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
\( 2> \) include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;
\( 2> \) if uplinkTxSwitchRequest is received:
\( 3> \) include into supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations that supported UL TX switching as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;

4 if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
\( 5> \) if SRS carrier switching is supported;
6> include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR and srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA for each band combination;
\( 5> \) set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
\( 3> \) include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch according to the previous;
\( 1> \) else (if the requested rat-Type is eutra):
\( 2> \) compile a list of "candidate feature set combinations" referenced from the list of "candidate band combinations" excluding entries (rows in feature set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;

NOTE 7: This list of "candidate feature set combinations" contains the feature set combinations used for E-UTRANR band combinations. It is used to derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the feature set combinations in a UE-MRDC-Capability container.
\( 2> \) include into featureSetsEUTRA (in the UE-EUTRA-Capability) the feature sets referenced from the "candidate feature set combinations" and may exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed \( c a \) -BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
\( 1> \) include the received frequencyBandListFilter in the field appliedFreqBandListFilter of the requested UE capability, except if the requested rat-Type is \( n r \) and the network included the eutra-nr-only field;
\( 1> \) if the network included ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt:
\( 2> \) include the received ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt in the field receivedFilters;
