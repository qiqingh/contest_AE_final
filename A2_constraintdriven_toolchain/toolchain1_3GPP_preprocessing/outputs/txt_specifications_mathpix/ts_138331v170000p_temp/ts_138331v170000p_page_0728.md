\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
featureCombinationPreambles \\
Specifies a series of preamble partitions each associated to a combination of features and 2-step RA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
groupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA \\
Preamble grouping for 2-step random access type. If the field is absent then there is only one preamble group configured and only one msgA PUSCH configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO \\
Number of contention-based preambles used for 2-step RA type from the non-CBRA 4-step type preambles associated with each SSB for RO shared with 4-step type RA. The number of preambles for 2-step RA type shall not exceed the number of preambles per SSB minus the number of contention-based preambles per SSB for 4-step type RA. The possible value range for this parameter needs to be aligned with value range for the configured SSBs per RACH occasion in ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB- \\
PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. The field is only applicable for the case of shared ROs with 4-step type random access.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PRACH-RootSequenceIndex \\
PRACH root sequence index. If the field is not configured, the UE applies the value in field prach-RootSequenceIndex in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access. \\
For FR2-2, only the following values are applicable depending on the used subcarrier spacing:
\( 120 \mathrm{kHz}: \mathrm{L}=139, \mathrm{~L}=571 \), and \( \mathrm{L}=1151 \)
\( 480 \mathrm{kHz}: \mathrm{L}=139 \), and \( \mathrm{L}=571 \)
\( 960 \mathrm{kHz}: \mathrm{L}=139 \)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RestrictedSetConfig \\
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets for 2-step random access type preamble. If the field is not configured, the UE applies the value in field restrictedSetConfig in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RSRP-Threshold \\
The UE selects 2-step random access type to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). This field is only present if both 2-step and 4step RA type are configured for the BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB \\
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB \\
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEight corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value \( n 4 \) corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value \( n 8 \) corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB* max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). If the field is not configured and both 2-step and 4 -step are configured for the BWP, the UE applies the value in the field ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. The field is not present when RACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step type random access in the BWP.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-SSB-SharedRO-Maskindex \\
Indicates the subset of 4 -step type ROs shared with 2 -step random access type for each SSB. This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, and 4 -step and 2 -step has shared ROs, then all ROs are shared.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-SubcarrierSpacing \\
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). \\
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency: \\
FR1: 15 or 30 kHz \\
FR2-1: 60 or 120 kHz \\
FR2-2: 120,480 , or 960 kHz . \\
If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the msgA-PRACH-Configurationindex in RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1, Table 6.3.3.1-2, Table 6.3.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.3.2-3, TS 38.211 [16]) in case of 2-step only BWP, otherwise the UE applies the same SCS as Msg1 derived from RACH- \\
ConfigCommon. The value also applies to contention free 2 -step random access type (RACH-ConfigDedicated).
