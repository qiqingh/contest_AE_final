\( 2> \) remove all the entries within VarConditionalReconfig, if any;
\( 2> \) for each measld, if the associated reportConfig has a reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
\( 3> \) for the associated reportConfigld:
\( 4> \) remove the entry with the matching reportConfigld from the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 3> \) if the associated measObjectld is only associated to a reportConfig with reportType set to condTriggerConfig:
