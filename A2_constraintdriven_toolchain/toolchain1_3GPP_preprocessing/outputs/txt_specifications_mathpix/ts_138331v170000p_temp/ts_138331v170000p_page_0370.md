\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RRCRelease-IEs field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cnType \\
Indicate that the UE is redirected to EPC or 5GC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deprioritisationReq \\
Indicates whether the current frequency or RAT is to be de-prioritised.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
deprioritisationTimer \\
Indicates the period for which either the current carrier frequency or NR is deprioritised. Value \( \min N \) corresponds to \( N \) minutes.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measidleConfig \\
Indicates measurement configuration to be stored and used by the UE while in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mpsPriorityindication \\
Indicates the UE can set the establishment cause to mps-PriorityAccess for a new connection to a new RAT following a redirect to NR. If the target RAT is E-UTRA, see TS 36.331 [10]. The gNB sets the indication only for UEs authorized to receive MPS treatment as indicated by ARP and/or QoS characteristics at the gNB, and it is applicable only for this instance of release with redirection to carrier/RAT included in the redirectedCarrierInfo field in the RRCRelease message.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srs-PosRRCinactiveConfig \\
SRS for positioning confifuration during RRC_INACTIVE State.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
suspendConfig \\
Indicates configuration for the RRC_INACTIVE state. The network does not configure suspendConfig when the network redirect the UE to an inter-RAT carrier frequency or if the UE is configured with a DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
redirectedCarrierinfo \\
Indicates a carrier frequency (downlink for FDD) and is used to redirect the UE to an NR or an inter-RAT carrier frequency, by means of cell selection at transition to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. Based on UE capability, the network may include redirectedCarrierlnfo in RRCRelease message with suspend Config if this message is sent in response to an RRCResumeRequest or an RRCResumeRequest 1 which is triggered by the NAS layer (see 5.3.1.4 in TS 24.501 [23]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
voiceFallbackindication \\
Indicates the RRC release is triggered by EPS fallback for IMS voice as specified in TS 23.502 [43].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
