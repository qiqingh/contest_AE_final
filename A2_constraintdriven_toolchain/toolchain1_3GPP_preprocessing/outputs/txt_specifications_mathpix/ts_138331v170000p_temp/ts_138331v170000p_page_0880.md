CA-ParametersNRDC field descriptions
ca-ParametersNR-forDC (with and without suffix)
If this field is present for a band combination, it reports the UE capabilities when NR-DC is configured with the band combination. If a version of this field (i.e., with or without suffix) is absent for a band combination, the corresponding ca-ParametersNR field version in BandCombination is applicable to the UE configured with NR-DC for the band combination. If a version of this field (i.e., with or without suffix) is present for a band combination but does not contain any parameters, the UE does not support the corresponding field version when configured with NR-DC for the band combination.
featureSetCombinationDC
If this field is present for a band combination, it reports the feature set combination supported for the band combination when NR-DC is configured. If this field is absent for a band combination, the featureSetCombination in BandCombination (without suffix) is applicable to the UE configured with NR-DC for the band combination.
- CarrierAggregationVariant

The IE CarrierAggregationVariant informs the network about supported "placement" of the SpCell in an NR cell group.
