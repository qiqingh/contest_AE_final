4> store the received [Pv6 address prefix for non-F1 traffic together with the IAB-donor-DU BAP address corresponding to the iab-IP-AddressIndex.

3> else:
4> store the received IPv6 address prefix for all traffic together with the IAB-donor-DU BAP address corresponding to the iab-IP-AddressIndex.

1> for each iab-IP-AddressIndex value included in the iab-IP-AddressToAddModList that is part of the current IABMT configuration :
\( 2> \) modify the IP address configuration(s) in accordance with the IAB-IP-AddressConfiguration corresponding to the iab-IP-AddressIndex.
5.3.5.13 Conditional Reconfiguration
5.3.5.13.1 General

The network configures the UE with one or more candidate target SpCells in the conditional reconfiguration. The UE evaluates the condition of each configured candidate target SpCell. The UE applies the conditional reconfiguration associated with one of the target SpCells which fulfils associated execution condition. The network provides the configuration parameters for the target SpCell in the ConditionalReconfiguration IE.

The UE performs the following actions based on a received ConditionalReconfiguration IE:
1> if the ConditionalReconfiguration contains the condReconfigToRemoveList:
\( 2> \) perform conditional reconfiguration removal procedure as specified in 5.3.5.13.2;
1> if the ConditionalReconfiguration contains the condReconfigToAddModList:
\( 2> \) perform conditional reconfiguration addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.13.3;
5.3.5.13.2 Conditional reconfiguration removal

The UE shall:
1> for each condReconfigld value included in the condReconfigToRemoveList that is part of the current UE conditional reconfiguration in VarConditionalReconfig:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching condReconfigId from the VarConditionalReconfig;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the condReconfigToRemoveList includes any condReconfigld value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.3.5.13.3 Conditional reconfiguration addition/modification

For each condReconfigld received in the condReconfigToAddModList IE the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if an entry with the matching condReconfigld exists in the condReconfigToAddModList within the VarConditionalReconfig:
\( 2> \) if the entry in condReconfigToAddModList includes an condExecutionCond or condExecutionCondSCG;
3> replace condExecutionCond or condExecutionCondSCG within the VarConditionalReconfig with the value received for this condReconfigId;
\( 2> \) if the entry in condReconfigToAddModList includes an condRRCReconfig;
3> replace condRRCReconfig within the VarConditionalReconfig with the value received for this condReconfigld;

1> else:
\( 2> \) add a new entry for this condReconfigld within the VarConditionalReconfig;
