measurements after layer 3 filtering taken duringsl-TimeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarMeasConfigSL (a subsequent NR sidelink frequency triggers the event):
\( 3> \) set the \( s \)-NumberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-Measld to 0;
\( 3> \) include the concerned NR sidelink frequency in the \( s \)-FrequencyTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-Measld;
\( 3> \) initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.8.10.5;
\( 2> \) else if the sl-ReportType is set to sl-EventTriggered and if the leaving condition applicable for this event is fulfilled for NR sidelink frequency included in the \( s \)-FrequencyTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this s/-Measld for all NR sidelink measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during sl-TimeToTrigger defined within the VarMeasConfigSL for this event:
\( 3> \) remove the concerned NR sidelink frequency in the \( s \)-FrequencyTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this s/-MeasId;
\( 3> \) if \( s \) l-ReportOnLeave is set to true for the corresponding reporting configuration:
\( 4> \) initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.8.10.5;
\( 3> \) if the \( s \)-FrequencyTriggeredList defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-Measld is empty:
\( 4> \) remove the NR sidelink measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportListSL for this \( s l \) Measld;
\( 4> \) stop the periodical reporting timer for this \( s \)-Measld, if running;
\( 2> \) if \( s \)-ReportType is set to \( s \) /-Periodical and if a (first) NR sidelink measurement result is available:
\( 3> \) include a NR sidelink measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportListSL for this \( s \)-Measld;
\( 3> \) set the \( s \)-NumberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportListSL for this sl-Measld to 0;
\( 3> \) initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.8 .10 .5 , immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the NR sidelink frequency:
\( 2> \) upon expiry of the periodical reporting timer for this sl-Measld:
\( 3> \) initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.8 .10 .5 .
5.8.10.4.2 Event S1 (Serving becomes better than threshold)

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when condition S1-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
\( 1> \) consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when condition S1-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
\( 1> \) for this NR sidelink measurement, consider the NR sidelink frequency corresponding to the associated \( s \) MeasObject associated with this event.

Inequality S1-1 (Entering condition)
\( M s-H y s> \) Thresh
Inequality S1-2 (Leaving condition)
\( M s+H y s< \) Thresh
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
\( M s \) is the NR sidelink measurement result of the NR sidelink frequency, not taking into account any offsets.
Hys is the hysteresis parameter for this event (i.e. sl-Hysteresis as defined within sl-ReportConfig for this event).
