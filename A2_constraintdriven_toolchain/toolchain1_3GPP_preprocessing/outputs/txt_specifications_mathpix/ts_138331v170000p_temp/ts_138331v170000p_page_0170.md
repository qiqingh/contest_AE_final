5.5.2.6 Reporting configuration removal

The UE shall:
1> for each reportConfigId included in the received reportConfigToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in VarMeasConfig:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching reportConfigId from the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) remove all measId associated with the reportConfigId from the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig, if any;
\( 2> \) if a measld is removed from the measldList:
3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the reportConfigToRemoveList includes any reportConfigld value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.5.2.7 Reporting configuration addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each reportConfigId included in the received reportConfigToAddModList:
\( 2> \) if an entry with the matching reportConfigld exists in the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig, for this entry:

3> reconfigure the entry with the value received for this reportConfig;
3> for each measId associated with this reportConfigId included in the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig, if any:

4> remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
4> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for the received reportConfig to the reportConfigList within the VarMeasConfig-
5.5.2.8 Quantity configuration

The UE shall:
1> for each RAT for which the received quantityConfig includes parameter(s):
\( 2> \) set the corresponding parameter(s) in quantityConfig within VarMeasConfig to the value of the received quantityConfig parameter(s);

1> for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
\( 2> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId.
