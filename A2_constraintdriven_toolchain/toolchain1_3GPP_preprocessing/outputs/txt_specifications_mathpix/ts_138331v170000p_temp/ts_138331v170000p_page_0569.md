\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline FrequencyinfoDL field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absoluteFrequencyPointA \\
Absolute frequency position of the reference resource block (Common RB 0). Its lowest subcarrier is also known as Point A (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.4.4.2). Note that the lower edge of the actual carrier is not defined by this field but rather in the scs-SpecificCarrierList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absoluteFrequencySSB \\
Frequency of the SSB to be used for this serving cell. SSB related parameters (e.g. SSB index) provided for a serving cell refer to this SSB frequency unless mentioned otherwise. The cell-defining SSB of the PCell is always on the sync raster. Frequencies are considered to be on the sync raster if they are also identifiable with a GSCN value (see TS 38.101-1 [15]). If the field is absent, the SSB related parameters should be absent, e.g. ssb-PositionsinBurst, ssb-periodicityServingCell and subcarrierSpacing in ServingCellConfigCommon IE. If the field is absent, the UE obtains timing reference from the SpCell or an SCell if applicable as described in TS 38.213[13], clause 4.1. This is only supported in case the SCell for which the UE obtains the timing reference is in the same frequency band as the cell (i.e. the SpCell or the SCell, respectively) from which the UE obtains the timing reference. \\
For cells supporting RedCap, on handover, corresponds to the cell-defining SSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyBandList \\
List containing only one frequency band to which this carrier(s) belongs. Multiple values are not supported.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scs-SpecificCarrierList \\
A set of carriers for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The network configures a scs-SpecificCarrier at least for each numerology (SCS) that is used e.g. in a BWP (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3).
