\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CG-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCellinfoListCPC \\
Contains information regarding candidate target cells for Conditional PSCell Change (CPC) that the source secondary gNB suggests the target secondary gNB to consider configuring for CPC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCellinfoListSN \\
Contains information regarding cells that the source secondary node suggests the target secondary gNB to consider configuring.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateCellinfoListSN-EUTRA \\
Includes the MeasResultList3EUTRA as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. Contains information regarding cells that the source secondary node suggests the target secondary eNB to consider configuring. This field is only used in NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
candidateServingFreqListNR, candidateServingFreqListEUTRA \\
Indicates frequencies of candidate serving cells for In-Device Co-existence Indication (see TS 36.331 [10]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
configRestrictModReq \\
Used by SN to request changes to SCG configuration restrictions previously set by MN to ensure UE capabilities are respected. E.g. can be used to request configuring an NR band combination whose use MN has previously forbidden. SN only includes this field in SN-initiated procedures.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-ConfigSCG \\
This field contains the complete DRX configuration of the SCG. This field is only used in NR-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-InfoSCG \\
This field contains the DRX long and short cycle configuration of the SCG. This field is used in (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-InfoSCG2 \\
This field contains the drx-onDurationTimer configuration of the SCG. This field is only used in (NG)EN-DC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fr-infoListSCG \\
Contains information of FR information of serving cells that include PScell and SCells configured in SCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measuredFrequenciesSN \\
Used by SN to indicate a list of frequencies measured by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
needForGaps \\
In NE-DC, indicates whether the SN requests gNB to configure measurements gaps.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-infoSCG \\
Power headroom information in SCG that is needed in the reception of PHR MAC CE of MCG
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-SupplementaryUplink \\
Power headroom information for supplementary uplink. In the case of (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, this field is only present when two UL carriers are configured for a serving cell and one UL carrier reports type1 PH while the other reports type 3 PH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-Type1or3 \\
Type of power headroom for a certain serving cell in SCG (PSCell and activated SCells). Value type 1 refers to type 1 power headroom, value type3 refers to type 3 power headroom. (See TS 38.321 [3]).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ph-Uplink \\
Power headroom information for uplink.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pSCellFrequency, pSCellFrequencyEUTRA \\
Indicates the frequency of PSCell in NR (i.e., pSCellFrequency) or E-UTRA (i.e., pSCellFrequencyEUTRA). In this version of the specification, pSCellFrequency is not used in NE-DC whereas pSCellFrequencyEUTRA is only used in NE-DC. pSCellFrequency indicates the absoluteFrequencySSB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportCGI-RequestNR, reportCGI-RequestEUTRA \\
Used by SN to indicate to MN about configuring reportCG/procedure. The request may optionally contain information about the cell for which SN intends to configure reportCG/ procedure. In this version of the specification, the reportCG/-RequestNR is used in (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC whereas reportCG/-RequestEUTRA is used only for NEDC.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
requestedBC-MRDC \\
Used to request configuring a band combination and corresponding feature sets which are forbidden to use by MN (i.e. outside of the allowedBC-ListMRDC) to allow renegotiation of the UE capabilities for SCG configuration.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
