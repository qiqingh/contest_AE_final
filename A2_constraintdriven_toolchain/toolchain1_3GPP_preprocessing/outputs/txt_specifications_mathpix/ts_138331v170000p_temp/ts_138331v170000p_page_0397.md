\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-TxResourceReq field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-CapabilityinformationSidelink \\
Includes the UECapabilitylnformationSidelink message (which can be also included in ueCapabilitylnformationSidelink-r16 in UECapabilityEnquirySidelink from peer UE) received from the peer UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-CastType \\
Indicates the cast type for the corresponding destination for which to request the resource.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-Destinationidentity \\
Indicates the destination for which the TX resource request and allocation from the network are concerned.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-DRX-InfoFromRx-List \\
Indicates list of the sidelink DRX assistance information received from peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-QoS-InfoList \\
Includes the QoS profile of the sidelink QoS flow as specified in TS 23.287 [55].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-QoS-Flowldentity \\
This identity uniquely identifies one sidelink QoS flow between the UE and the network in the scope of UE, which is unique for different destination and cast type.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-RLC-Modelndication \\
This field indicates the RLC mode and optionally the related QoS profiles for the sidelink radio bearer, which has not been configured by the network and is initiated by another UE in unicast. The RLC mode for one sidelink radio bearer is aligned between UE and NW by the si-QoS-Flowldentity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-TxinterestedFreqList \\
Each entry of this field indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit NR sidelink communication. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list. In this release, only one entry can be included in the list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-TypeTxSyncList \\
A list of synchronization reference used by the UE. The UE shall include the same number of entries, listed in the same order, as in si-TxinterestedFreqList, i.e. one for each carrier frequency included in si-TxinterestedFreqList.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-Failure field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-Destinationidentity \\
Indicates the destination for which the SL failure is reporting for unicast.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-Failure \\
Indicates the sidelink failure cause for the sidelink RLF (value \( n f \) ) and sidelink AS configuration failure (value configFailure) for the associated destination for unicast.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
