\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the RRCSystemInfoRequest message with rrcPosSystemInfoRequest in accordance with 5.2.2.3.4;
\( 2> \) if acknowledgement for RRCSystemInfoRequest message with rrcPosSystemInfoRequest is received from lower layers:
\( 3> \) acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> if cell reselection occurs while waiting for the acknowledgment for SI request from lower layers:
\( 2> \) reset MAC ;
\( 2> \) if SI request is based on RRCSystemInfoRequest message with rrcPosSystemInfoRequest:
3> release RLC entity for SRB0.
NOTE: After RACH failure for SI request it is up to UE implementation when to retry the SI request.
5.2.2.3.4 Actions related to transmission of RRCSysteminfoRequest message

The UE shall set the contents of RRCSystemInfoRequest message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the procedure is triggered to request the required SI message(s) other than positioning:
\( 2> \) set the requested-SI-List to indicate the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting;
\( 1> \) else if the procedure is triggered to request the required SI message(s) for positioning:
\( 2> \) set the requestedPosSI-List to indicate the SI message(s) that the UE upper layers require for positioning operations, and for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.

The UE shall submit the RRCSystemInfoRequest message to lower layers for transmission.
5.2.2.3.5 Acquisition of SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in RRC_CONNECTED

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP not configured with common search space with the field searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:
\( 2> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the si-SchedulingInfo or posSI-SchedulingInfo in the stored SIB1, contain at least one required SIB or requested posSIB:

3> if onDemandSIB-Request is configured and timer T350 is not running:
4> initiate transmission of the DedicatedSIBRequest message in accordance with 5.2.2.3.6;
\( 4> \) start timer T350 with the timer value set to the onDemandSIB-RequestProhibitTimer;
\( 1> \) else if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP configured with common search space with the field searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required \( \mathrm{SIB}(\mathrm{s}) \) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause
5.2.2.1:
\( 2> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the si-SchedulingInfo in the stored SIB1, contain at least one required SIB and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to broadcasting:
\( 3> \) acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2;
\( 2> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the si-SchedulingInfo in the stored SIB1, contain at least one required SIB and for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting:
\( 3> \) if onDemandSIB-Request is configured and timer T350 is not running:
