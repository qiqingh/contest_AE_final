\( 1> \) stop timer T400 for the destination, if running;
\( 1> \) consider the configurations in the corresponding RRCReconfigurationSidelink message to be applied.
Editor's Note: to be captured on behaviour after rejection, based on which message used. Related agreement "Keep RX UE's reject option for SL DRX configuration sent by TX UE. If reject happens for initial SL DRX configuration, default SL DRX configuration is no UC SL DRX. FFS on the default SL DRX configuration for non-initial SL DRX configuration. No enhancement to resolve any deadlock issue in Rel-17."
5.8.9.1.10 Sidelink reset configuration

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) release/clear current sidelink radio configuration of this destination received in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink;
\( 1> \) release the sidelink DRBs of this destination, in according to clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
\( 1> \) reset the sidelink specific MAC of this destination.
NOTE 1: Sidelink radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but may include other configurations included in the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message except the sidelink DRBs of this destination.

NOTE 2: After the sidelink DRB release procedure, UE may perform the sidelink DRB addition according to the current sidelink configuration of this destination, received in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12 and SidelinkPreconfigNR, according to clause 5.8.9.1a.2.
5.8.9.1a Sidelink radio bearer management
5.8.9.1a. 1 Sidelink DRB release
5.8.9.1a.1.1 Sidelink DRB release conditions

For NR sidelink communication, a sidelink DRB release is initiated in the following cases:
\( 1> \) for groupcast, broadcast and unicast, if strb-Uu-ConfigIndex (if any) of the sidelink DRB is included in \( s \) RadioBearerToReleaseList in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR; or
\( 1> \) for groupcast and broadcast, if no sidelink QoS flow with data indicated by upper layers is mapped to the sidelink DRB for transmission, which is (re)configured by receiving SIB12 or SidelinkPreconfigNR; or
\( 1> \) for groupcast, broadcast and unicast, if SL-RLC-BearerConfigIndex (if any) of the sidelink DRB is included in sl-RLC-BearerToReleaseList in sl-ConfigDedicatedNR; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, if no sidelink QoS flow with data indicated by upper layers is mapped to the sidelink DRB for transmission, which is (re)configured by receiving SIB12 or SidelinkPreconfigNR, and if no sidelink QoS flow mapped to the sidelink DRB, which is (re)configured by receiving RRCReconfigurationSidelink, has data; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, if SLRB-PC5-ConfigIndex (if any) of the sidelink DRB is included in strb-ConfigToReleaseList in RRCReconfigurationSidelink or if sl-ResetConfig is included in RRCReconfigurationSidelink; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, when the corresponding PC5-RRC connection is released due to sidelink RLF being detected, according to clause 5.8.9.3; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, when the corresponding PC5-RRC connection is released due to upper layer request according to clause 5.8.9.5.
5.8.9.1a.1.2 Sidelink DRB release operations

For each sidelink DRB, whose sidelink DRB release conditions are met as in clause 5.8.9.1a.1.1, the UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication shall:
\( 1> \) for groupcast and broadcast; or
