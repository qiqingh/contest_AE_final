\( 4> \) configure the integrity protection function of the target cell group PDCP entity with the integrity protection algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{UPmt}} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) configure the ciphering function and the integrity protection function of the target cell group PDCP entity with the same security configuration as the PDCP entity for the source cell group;
\( 2> \) if the sdap-Config is included and when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in [3]:

3> reconfigure the SDAP entity in accordance with the received sdap-Config as specified in TS 37.324 [24];
3> for each QFI value added in mappedQoS-FlowsToAdd, if the QFI value is previously configured, the QFI value is released from the old DRB;
\( 1> \) for each \( d r b \)-Identity value included in the \( d r b \)-ToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration and not configured as DAPS bearer:
\( 2> \) if the reestablishPDCP is set:
\( 3> \) if target RAT of handover is E-UTRA/5GC; or
3> if the UE is connected to E-UTRA/5GC:
\( 4> \) if the UE is capable of E-UTRA/5GC but not capable of NGEN-DC:
\( 5> \) if the PDCP entity of this DRB is not configured with cipheringDisabled:
\( 6> \) configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithm and \( K_{\text {UPenc }} \) key configured/derived as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.4.2.3, i.e the ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent PDCP PDUs received and sent by the UE;

4> else (i.e., a UE capable of NGEN-DC):
\( 5> \) if the PDCP entity of this DRB is not configured with cipheringDisabled:
6> configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithm and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} \) ) or the secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ), as indicated in keyToUse, i.e. the ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent PDCP PDUs received and sent by the UE;
\( 3> \) else (i.e., UE connected to NR or UE connected to E-UTRA/EPC (in EN-DC or capable of EN-DC)):
\( 4> \) if the PDCP entity of this DRB is not configured with cipheringDisabled:
\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the ciphering algorithm and \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\varepsilon \mathrm{NB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) or the secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} / \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\varepsilon \mathrm{NB}} \) ), as indicated in keyToUse, i.e. the ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent PDCP PDUs received and sent by the UE;

4> if the PDCP entity of this DRB is configured with integrityProtection:
\( 5> \) configure the PDCP entity with the integrity protection algorithms according to securityConfig and apply the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{UP} \text { Int }} \) key associated with the master key \( \left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}}\right) \) or the secondary key \( \left(\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}}\right) \) as indicated in keyToUse;

3> if drb-ContinueROHC is included in pdcp-Config:
\( 4> \) indicate to lower layer that \( d r b \)-ContinueROHC is configured;
\( 3> \) if drb-ContinueEHC-DL is included in pdcp-Config:
\( 4> \) indicate to lower layer that \( d r b \)-ContinueEHC-DL is configured;
\( 3> \) if drb-ContinueEHC-UL is included in pdcp-Config:
