\hline ConnEstFailReport field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultFailedCell \\
This field refers to the last measurement results taken in the cell, where connection establishment failure or connection resume failure happened.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultNeighCells \\
This field refers to the neighbour cell measurements when connection establishment failure or connection resume failure happened.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfConnFail \\
This field is used to indicate the latest number of consecutive failed RRCSetup or RRCResume procedures in the same cell independent of RRC state transition.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeSinceFailure \\
This field is used to indicate the time that elapsed since the connection (establishment or resume) failure. Value in seconds. The maximum value 172800 means 172800s or longer.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
perRAInfoList, perRAInfoList-v1660 \\
This field provides detailed information about each of the random access attempts in the chronological order of the random access attempts. If perRAInfoList-v1660 is present, it shall contain the same number of entries, listed in the same order as in perRAInfoList-r16.
