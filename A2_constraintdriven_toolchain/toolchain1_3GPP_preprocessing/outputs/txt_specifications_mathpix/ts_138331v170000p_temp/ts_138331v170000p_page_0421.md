\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RA-Report field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellID \\
This field indicates the CGI of the cell in which the associated random access procedure was performed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
contentionDetected \\
This field is used to indicate that contention was detected for the transmitted preamble in the given random access attempt or not. This field is not included when the UE performs random access attempt is using contention free random-access resources or when the raPurpose is set to requestForOtherS/or when the RA attempt is a 2 -step RA attempt and fallback to 4-step RA did not occur (i.e. fallbackToFourStepRA is not included or is set to false).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-RS-Index, csi-RS-Index-v1660 \\
This field is used to indicate the CSI-RS index corresponding to the random access attempt. \\
If the random access procedure is for beam failure recovery, the field indicates the NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld. For CSI-RS index larger than maxNrofCSI-RS-ResourcesRRM-1, the index value is the sum of csi-RS-Index (without suffix) and csi-RS-Index-v1660.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dIPathlossRSRP \\
Measeured RSRP of the DL pathloss reference obtained at the time of RA_Type selection stage of the RA procedure as captured in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
diRSRPAbove Threshold \\
In 4 step random access procedure, this field is used to indicate whether the DL beam (SSB) quality associated to the random access attempt was above or below the threshold rsrp-ThresholdSSB in beamFailureRecoveryConfig in UL BWP configuration of UL BWP selected for random access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery; Otherwise, rsrp-ThresholdSSB in rach-ConfigCommon in UL BWP configuration of UL BWP selected for random access procedure. \\
In 2 step random access procedure, this field is used to indicate whether the DL beam (SSB) quality associated to the random access attempt was above or below the threshold msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB in rach-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA in UL BWP configuration of UL BWP selected for random access procedure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
fallbackToFourStepRA \\
This field indicates if a fallback indication in MsgB is received (according to TS 38.321 [3]) for the 2-step random access attempt.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intendedSIBs \\
This field indicates the SIB(s) the UE wanted to receive as a result of the on demand SI request (when the RA procedure is a used as a SI request) initiated by the UE. That is, it indicates the one(s) of the SIB(s) in the SI message(s) requested to be broadcast that the UE was interested in.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msg1-SCS-From-prach-Configurationindex \\
This field is set by the UE with the corresponding SCS as derived from the prach-Configuration/ndex in RACH-ConfigGeneric when the msg1-SubcarrierSpacing is absent; otherwise, this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-PUSCH-PayloadSize \\
This field indicates the size of the overall payload available in the UE buffer at the time of initiating the 2 step RA procedure. The value refers to the index of TS 38.321 [3], table 6.1.3.1-1, corresponding to the UE buffer size.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FDM \\
This field indicates the number of msgA PRACH transmission occasions Frequency-Division Multiplexed in one time instance for the PRACH resources configured for 2-step CBRA..
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FDMCFRA \\
This field indicates the number of msgA PRACH transmission occasions Frequency-Division Multiplexed in one time instance for the PRACH resources configured for 2-step CFRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FrequencyStart \\
This field indicates the lowest resource block of the contention based random-access resources for 2-step CBRA attempts in the random-access procedure. The indication has the form of the offset of the lowest PRACH transmissions occasion with respect to PRB 0 in the frequency domain.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-RO-FrequencyStartCFRA \\
This field indicates the lowest resource block of the contention free random-access resources for the 2-step CFRA attempts in the random-access procedure. The indication has the form of the offset of the lowest PRACH transmissions occasion with respect to PRB 0 in the frequency domain.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
msgA-SCS-From-prach-Configurationindex \\
This field is set by the UE with the corresponding SCS as derived from the msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA when the msgASubcarrierSpacing is absent; otherwise, this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
numberOfPreamblesSentOnCSI-RS \\
This field is used to indicate the total number of successive RA preambles that were transmitted on the corresponding CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
