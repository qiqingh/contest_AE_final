\( 1> \) include \( s l \)-PagingDelivery if the Paging message received from network containing the associated ue-Identity of the L2 U2N Remote UE;
\( 1> \) include \( s \)-SystemInformationDelivery if any of the conditions for initiating Uu message transfer procedure related to System Information are met;

1> submit the UuMessageTransferSidelink message to lower layers for transmission.
NOTE: The L2 U2N Relay UE always forwards SIB1 to the L2 U2N Remote UE.
5.8.9.9.3 Reception of the UuMessage TransferSidelink

Upon receiving the UuMessageTransferSidelink message, the L2 U2N Remote UE shall:
\( 1> \) if sl-PagingDelivery is included:
\( 2> \) perform the procedure as defined in clause 5.3.2.3;
\( 1> \) if \( s \)-SystemInformationDeliverySidelink is included:
\( 2> \) perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4;
5.8.9.10 Notification Message
5.8.9.10.1 General

Figure 5.8.9.8.1-1: Notification message in sidelink

This procedure is used by a U2N Relay UE to send notification to the connected U2N Remote UE.
5.8.9.10.2 Initiation

The U2N Relay UE can initiate the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
\( 1> \) upon Uu RLF as specified in 5.3.10;
\( 1> \) upon reception of an RRCReconfiguration including the reconfigurationWithSync;
1> upon cell reselection;
1> upon L2 U2N Relay UE's RRC connection failure including RRC connection reject as specified in 5.3.3.5 and 5.3.13.10, and T300 expiry as specified in 5.3.3.7, and RRC resume failure as specified in 5.3.13.5;
5.8.9.10.3 Actions related to transmission of NotificationMessageSidelink message

The U2N Relay UE shall set the indication type as follows:
1> if the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to Uu RLF:
\( 2> \) set the indicationType as relayUE-UuRLF;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the NotificationMessageSidelink message due to reconfiguration with sync:
\( 2> \) set the indicationType as relayUE-HO;
