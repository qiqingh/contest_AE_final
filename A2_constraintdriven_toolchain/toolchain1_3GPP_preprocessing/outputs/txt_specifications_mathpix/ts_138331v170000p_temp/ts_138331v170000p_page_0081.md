\( 2> \) if the scg-State is not included in the RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume message containing the RRCReconfiguration message:

3> if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig in nr-SCG; or
3> if the SCG was deactivated before the reception of the NR RRC message containing the RRCReconfiguration message and lower layers consider that a Random Access procedure is needed for SCG activation:

4> initiate the Random Access procedure on the PSCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
\( 3> \) else:
4> the procedure ends;
\( 2> \) else
\( 3> \) the procedure ends;
NOTE 2a: The order in which the UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message and performs the Random Access procedure towards the SCG is left to UE implementation.
\( 1> \) else if the RRCReconfiguration message was received via SRB3 (UE in NR-DC):
2 if the RRCReconfiguration message was received within DLInformationTransferMRDC:
3> if the RRCReconfiguration message was received within the nr-SCG within mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup (NR SCG RRC Reconfiguration):

4> if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig in nr-SCG:
\( 5> \) initiate the Random Access procedure on the PSCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
4> else:
\( 5> \) the procedure ends;
\( 3> \) else:
4> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB1 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;
\( 2> \) else:
3> submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB3 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;

1> else (RRCReconfiguration was received via SRB1):
\( 2> \) submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB1 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;
\( 2> \) if this is the first RRCReconfiguration message after successful completion of the RRC re-establishment procedure:

3> resume SRB2, SRB4, and DRBs, multicast MRB, and BH RLC channels for IAB-MT, that are suspended;

1> if reconfiguration WithSync was included in spCellConfig of an MCG or SCG, and when MAC of an NR cell group successfully completes a Random Access procedure triggered above:
\( 2> \) stop timer T304 for that cell group;
\( 2> \) stop timer T310 for source SpCell if running;
\( 2> \) apply the parts of the CSI reporting configuration, the scheduling request configuration and the sounding RS configuration that do not require the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell, if any;
