\( 5> \) set \( s \)-QoS-InfoList to include QoS profile(s) of the sidelink QoS flow(s) of the associated destination configured by the upper layer for the NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 5> \) set \( s \)-InterestedFreqList to indicate the frequency of the associated destination for NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 5> \) set \( s l \)-TypeTxSyncList to the current synchronization reference type used on the associated \( s l \) InterestedFreqList for NR sidelink communication transmission.
\( 5> \) set \( s \)-CapabilityInformationSidelink to include UECapabilityInformationSidelink message, if any, received from the associated peer UE.
\( 5> \) if \( s l-D R X \)-ConfigCommon-GC-BC is included in SIB12-IEs and UE is configured with \( s l- \) ScheduledConfig:
\( 6> \) set \( s l \)-DRX-InfoFromRx to include the sidelink DRX assistance information of the associated destination, if any, received from the associated peer UE;

Editor's Note: FFS on the message used for Tx UE to report DRX configuration reject information.
\( 4> \) if a sidelink radio link failure or a sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure has been declared, according to clauses 5.8.9.3 and 5.8.9.1.8, respectively;
\( 5> \) include \( s \)-FailureList and set its fields as follows for each destination for which it reports the NR sidelink communication failure:
\( 6> \) set \( s \)-Destinationldentity to the destination identity configured by upper layer for NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 6> \) if the sidelink RLF is detected as specified in clause 5.8.9.3:
\( 7> \) set \( s l \)-Failure as \( r l f \) for the associated destination for the NR sidelink communication transmission;

6> else if RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink is received:
\( 7> \) set \( s \)-Failure as configFailure for the associated destination for the NR sidelink communication transmission;
\( 3> \) if SIB12 including \( s \)-NonRelayDiscovery and if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink nonrelay discovery announcements, or if SIB 12 including sl-L2U2N-Relay and if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink L2 U2N relay discovery announcements, or if SIB 12 including sl-L3U2NRelayDiscovery and if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink L3 U2N relay discovery announcements:
\( 4> \) include \( s \) /-RxInterestedFreqListDisc and set it to the frequency for NR sidelink discovery announcements reception;
\( 4> \) if the UE is capable of L2 U2N remote UE:
\( 5> \) include \( s / \)-Sourceldentity-Remote \( U E \) and set it to the source identity configured by upper layer for NR sidelink L2 U2N relay communication transmission;

\( 4> \) include \( s \)-TxResourceReqListDis and set its fields (if needed) as follows for each destination for which it requests network to assign NR sidelink discovery announcements resource:
\( 5> \) set \( s \)-DestinationIdentityDisc to the destination identity configured by upper layer for NR sidelink discovery announcements transmission;
\( 5> \) if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Relay UE
