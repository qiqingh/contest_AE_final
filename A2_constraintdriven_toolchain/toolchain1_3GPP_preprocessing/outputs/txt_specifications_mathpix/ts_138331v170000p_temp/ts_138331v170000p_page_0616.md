\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasResultNR field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
averageDelay \\
Indicates average delay for the packets during the reporting period, as specified in TS 38.314 [53]. Value 0 corresponds to 0 millisecond, value 1 corresponds to 0.1 millisecond, value 2 corresponds to 0.2 millisecond, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellResults \\
Cell level measurement results.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
choCandidate \\
This field indicates whether the associated cell is a candidate target cell for conditional handover. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UE/nformationResponse message, e.g., SuccessHO-Report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
choConfig \\
If the associated cell is a candidate target cell for conditional handover, this field indicates the conditional handover execution condition for each meas/ \( d \) within condTriggerConfig associated to the cell. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UEInformationResponse message, e.g., iff-Report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
condFirstEventFullilled \\
This field indicates whether the first entry of choConfig corresponds to a fullfilled execution condition at the moment of conditional reconfiguration execution, or radio link failure. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UE/nformationResponse message, e.g., \( n f \)-Report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
condSecondEventFullilled \\
This field indicates whether the second entry of choConfig corresponds to a fulfilled execution condition at the moment of conditional reconfiguration execution, or radio link failure. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UE/nformationResponse message, e.g., Nf-Report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-ld \\
Indicates DRB value for which uplink PDCP delay ratio or value is provided, according to TS 38.314 [53].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
firstTriggeredEvent \\
This field is set to condFirstEvent if the execution condition associated to the first entry of choConfig was fulfilled first in time. This field is set to condSecondEvent if the execution condition associated to the second entry of choConfig was fulfilled first in time. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UEInformationResponse message, e.g., nf-Report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
locationinfo \\
Positioning related information and measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
physCellid \\
The physical cell identity of the NR cell for which the reporting is being performed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resultsSSB-Cell \\
Cell level measurement results based on SS/PBCH related measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resultsSSB-indexes \\
Beam level measurement results based on SS/PBCH related measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resultsCSI-RS-Cell \\
Cell level measurement results based on CSI-RS related measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resultsCSI-RS-Indexes \\
Beam level measurement results based on CSI-RS related measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rsindexResults \\
Beam level measurement results.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeBetweenEvents \\
Indicates the time elapsed between fulfilling the conditional execution conditions included in choConfig. Value in milliseconds. The maximum value 1023 means 1023 ms or longer. This field may be included only in the reports associated to UEInformationResponse message, e.g., if-Report.
