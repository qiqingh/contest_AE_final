5.6.1.4 Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets supported by the UE

The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network requests UE capabilities for \( n r \), eutra-nr or eutra. This procedure is invoked once per requested rat-Type (see clause 5.61 .3 for capability enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set [Ds are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries with the same fields with the same values, i.e. \( U E \) CapabilityRequestFilterNR, UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon and fields in UECapabilityEnquiry message (i.e-requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC, requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only flag, and requestedCapabilityCommon) as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.

NOTE 1: Capability enquiry without frequencyBandListFilter is not supported.
NOTE 2: In EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types \( n r \) and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSets in the UE-NR-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types eutra and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSetsEUTRA in the UE-EUTRACapability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the EUTRA UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the featureSets must match the IDs referred to in featureSetCombinations across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.

NOTE 3: If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) compile a list of "candidate band combinations" according to the filter criteria in capabilityRequestFilterCommon (if included), only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilter, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilter (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the band do not exceed maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL, maxCarriersRequestedUL, ca-BandwidthClassDLEUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
\( 1> \) for each band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations":
\( 2> \) if the network (E-UTRA) included the eutra-nr-only field, or
\( 2> \) if the requested rat-Type is eutra:
\( 3> \) remove the NR-only band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 4: The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for \( n r \) but indicate with the eutra-nr-only flag that the UE shall not include any NR band combinations in the UE-NR-Capability. In this case the procedural text above removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets below.
\( 2> \) if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities of another band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations", and
