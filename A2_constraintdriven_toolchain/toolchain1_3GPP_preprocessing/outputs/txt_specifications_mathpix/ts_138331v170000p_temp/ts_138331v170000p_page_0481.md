\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline PreConfigMG & The field is optionally present, Need R , if there is at least one per UE gap configured with preConfigind or there is at least one per FR gap of the same FR which the BWP belongs to and configured with preConfigind. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline ScellOnly & The field is optionally present, Need M, in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated of an Scell. It is absent otherwise. \\

- BWP-Id

The IE BWP-Id is used to refer to Bandwidth Parts (BWP). The initial BWP is referred to by BWP-Id 0. The other BWPs are referred to by BWP-Id 1 to maxNrofBWPs.

- BWP-Uplink

The IE BWP-Uplink is used to configure an additional uplink bandwidth part (not for the initial BWP).

BWP-Uplink field descriptions
bwp-id
An identifier for this bandwidth part. Other parts of the RRC configuration use the BWP-Id to associate themselves with a particular bandwidth part.
The network configures the BWPs with consecutive IDs from 1 . The Network does not include the value 0 , since value 0 is reserved for the initial BWP.
