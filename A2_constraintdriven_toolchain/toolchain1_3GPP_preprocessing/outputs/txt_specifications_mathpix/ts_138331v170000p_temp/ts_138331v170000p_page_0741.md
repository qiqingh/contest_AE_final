\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SecurityConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
keyToUse \\
Indicates if the bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig are using the master key or the secondary key for deriving ciphering and/or integrity protection keys. For MR-DC, network should not configure SRB1 and SRB2 with secondary key and SRB3 with the master key. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
securityAlgorithmConfig \\
Indicates the security algorithm for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SRB-ToAddMod field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
discardOnPDCP \\
Indicates that PDCP should discard stored SDU and PDU according to TS 38.323 [5].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reestablishPDCP \\
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to reconfiguration with sync, for SRB2 when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR. For SRB1, when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR, the network does not set this field to true. For LTE SRBs using NR PDCP, it could be for handover, RRC connection reestablishment or resume. Network doesn't include this field if any DAPS bearer is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
srb-Identity, srb-Identity-v1700 \\
Value 1 is applicable for SRB1 only. Value 2 is applicable for SRB2 only. Value 3 is applicable for SRB3 only. Value 4 is applicable for SRB4 only. If srb-Identity-v1700 is received for an SRB, the UE shall ignore srb-Identity (i.e. without suffix) for this SRB.
