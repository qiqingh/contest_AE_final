5.2.2.4.2 Actions upon reception of the SIB1

Upon receiving the SIBI the UE shall:
\( 1> \) store the acquired \( S I B 1 \);
1> if the UE is a RedCap UE and it is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE, or if the RedCap UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
\( 2> \) if intraFreqReselectionRedCap is not present in SIB1:
3> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 [20];
3> perform barring as if intraFreqReselectionRedCap is set to allowed;
\( 2> \) else:
3> if the cellBarredRedCaplRx is present in the acquired SIBI and is set to barred and the UE is equipped with 1 Rx branch; or

3> if the cellBarredRedCap2Rx is present in the acquired SIBI and is set to barred and the UE is equipped with 2 Rx branches; or

3> if the halfDuplexRedCapAllowed is not present in the acquires SIBI and the UE supports only half-duplex FDD operation:

4> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 [20];
4> consider cell re-selection to other cells on the same frequency as the barred cell as specified in TS 38.304 [20];

1> if the cellAccessRelatedInfo contains an entry of a selected SNPN or PLMN and in case of PLMN the UE is either allowed or instructed to access the PLMN via a cell for which at least one CAG ID is broadcast:
\( 2> \) in the remainder of the procedures use npn-IdentityList, trackingAreaCode, trackingAreaList, and cellldentity for the cell as received in the corresponding entry of npn-IdentityInfoList containing the selected PLMN or SNPN;
\( 1> \) else if the cellAccessRelatedInfo contains an entry with the PLMN-Identity of the selected PLMN:
\( 2> \) in the remainder of the procedures use plmn-IdentityList, trackingAreaCode, trackingAreaList, and cellldentity for the cell as received in the corresponding PLMN-IdentityInfo containing the selected PLMN;

1> if in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is not running:
\( 2> \) disregard the frequencyBandList, if received, while in RRC_CONNECTED;
\( 2> \) forward the cellldentity to upper layers;
\( 2> \) forward the trackingAreaCode to upper layers;
\( 2> \) forward the trackingArealist to upper layers, if included;
\( 2> \) forward the received posSIB-MappingInfo to upper layers, if included;
\( 2> \) apply the configuration included in the servingCellConfigCommon;
\( 2> \) if the UE has a stored valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, that the UE requires to operate within the cell in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1:
\( 3> \) use the stored version of the required SIB or posSIB;
\( 2> \) else:
