- When the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as described in example 1 above. Note that if the list element ID type changes in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID (e.g. ListElementId-vNxy). If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the extension list holding new entries. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel ToRelease list is needed (i.e there is no listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:
```
-- /example 3/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE \
```

```
    ...;
    [ [
    -- Non-critical extension lists
```

```
    -- Parallel list with maxNrofListElements-rN = maxNrofListElements + maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN
```

```
