\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PDCCH-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
controIResourceSetToAddModList, controIResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt \\
List of UE specifically configured Control Resource Sets (CORESETs) to be used by the UE. The network restrictions on configuration of CORESETs per DL BWP are specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1 and TS 38.306 [26]. The UE shall consider entries in controlResourceSetToAddModList and in \\
controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt as a single list, i.e. an entry created using controlResourceSetToAddModList can be modified using \\
controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSet configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon. The network shall not use same ControlResourceSet/d as used for commonControlResourceSetExt configured via SIB20 in this field.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
contro/ResourceSetToReleaseList, controIResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt \\
List of UE specifically configured Control Resource Sets (CORESETs) to be released by the UE. This field only applies to CORESETs configured by controlResourceSetToAddModList or controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt and does not release the field commonControlResourceSet configured by PDCCHConfigCommon and commonControlResourceSetExt configured by SIB20.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
downlinkPreemption \\
Configuration of downlink preemption indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
monitoringCapabilityConfig \\
Configures either Rel-15 PDCCH monitoring capability or Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell. Value r 15 monitoringcapablity enables the Rel-15 monitoring capability, and value \( r 16 \) monitoringcapablity enables the Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). r17monitoringcapability enables the Rel-17 PDCCH multi-slot monitoring capability (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). For 480 and 960 kHz SCS, only value r 17 monitoringcapability is applicable.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdcch-SkippingDurationList \\
The UE can be configured to be indicated by DCI a value of X (i.e., skipping duration), in units of slots, among at most 3 multiple RRC configured values by scheduling DCIs indicating PDCCH schedules data. For each skipping duration (i.e. the value range of IE PDCCH-SkippingDuration-r17), \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 20,30,40,50,60,80,100\} \) are valid for the 15 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 40,60,80,100,120,160,200\} \) are valid for 30 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 80,120,160,200,240,320,400\} \) are valid for 60 kHz SCS, and \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 160,240 \), \( 320,400,480,640,800\} \) are valid for 120 kHz SCS,\( \{4,8,12, \ldots, 640,960,1280,1600,1920,2560,3200\} \) are valid for 480 kHz SCS, and \( \{8,16,24, \ldots, 1280,1920,2560,3200,3840 \), 5120,6400 ) are valid for 960 kHz SCS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpacesToAddModList, searchSpacesToAddModListExt \\
List of UE specifically configured Search Spaces or MBS multicast Search Spaces. The network configures at most 10 Search Spaces per BWP per cell (including UE-specific and common Search Spaces). If the network includes searchSpaceToAddModListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in searchSpacesToAddModList in each of them.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
searchSpaceSwitchTimer \\
Timer (in unit of slots) to control the UE behavior to switch from search space group X back to search space group 0, as specified in clause 10 of TS 38.213. A UE does not expect to be configured with Rel-16 SSSG switching parameters and Rel-17 SSSG switching parameters per cell simultaneously. For 15 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 20,30,40,50,60 \), \( 80,100\} \) are valid. For 30 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 40,60,80,100,120,160,200\} \) are valid. For 60 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 80,120,160,200,240,320,400\} \) are valid. For 120 kHz SCS, \( \{1,2,3, \ldots, 160,240,320,400,480,640,800\} \) are valid. For 480 kHz SCS, \( \{4,8,12, \ldots, 640,960,1280,1600,1920,2560,3200\} \) are valid. For 960 kHz SCS, \( \{8,16,24, \ldots, 1280,1920 \), 2560,3200, 3840, 5120,6400\} are valid.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sfnScheme \\
This parameter is used to configure SFN scheme for PDCCH: scheme 1 (sfnSchemeA) or TRP-based pre-compensation (sfnSchemeB). The PDCCH-Config:s in all BWPs (except BWP\#0) of a ServingCell should have the same configuration of SFN scheme.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tpc-PUCCH \\
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUCCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tpc-PUSCH \\
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUSCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
tpc-SRS \\
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for SRS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

Configuration of uplink cancellation indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A).
