5.7.3b MCG failure information
5.7.3b.1 General

Figure 5.7.3b.1-1: MCG failure information

The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network about an MCG failure the UE has experienced i.e. MCG radio link failure. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB setup or, for IAB, SRB2, may initiate the fast MCG link recovery procedure in order to continue the RRC connection without re-establishment.
5.7.3b. 2 Initiation

A UE configured with split SRB1 or SRB3 initiates the procedure to report MCG failures when neither MCG nor SCG transmission is suspended, the SCG is not deactivated, \( t 316 \) is configured, and when the following condition is met:
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG, in accordance with 5.3.10.3, while T316 is not running.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> stop timer T310 for the PCell, if running;
1> stop timer T312 for the PCell, if running;
\( 1> \) suspend MCG transmission for all SRBs, DRBs, multicast MRBs, except SRB0, and, if any, BH RLC channels;
\( 1> \) reset MCG MAC;
\( 1> \) stop conditional reconfiguration evaluation for CHO , if configured;
\( 1> \) stop conditional reconfiguration evaluation for CPC, if configured;
1> initiate transmission of the MCGFailureInformation message in accordance with 5.7.3b.4.
NOTE: The handling of any outstanding UL RRC messages during the initiation of the fast MCG link recovery is left to UE implementation.
5.7.3b. 3 Failure type determination

The UE shall set the MCG failure type as follows:
1> if the UE initiates transmission of the MCGFailureInformation message due to T310 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as t310-Expiry;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the MCGFailureInformation message due to T312 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the failureType as t312-Expiry;
1> else if the UE initiates transmission of the MCGFailureInformation message to provide random access problem indication from MCG MAC:
\( 2> \) if the random access procedure was initiated for beam failure recovery:
