\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-GapProhibitTimer \\
Prohibit timer for MUSIM assistance information reporting without leaving RRC_CONNECTED for MUSIM purpose.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-LeaveAssistanceConfig \\
Configuration for the UE to report assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED for MUSIM purpose.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
musim-LeaveWithoutResponseTimer \\
Indicates the timer for to leave RRC_CONNECTED without network response. When T346g expires, UE autonomously leaves RRC_CONNECTED state and enters RRC_IDLE for MUSIM purpose.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
obtainCommonLocation \\
Requests the UE to attempt to have detailed location information available using GNSS. NR configures the field if includeCommonLocation/nfo is configured for one or more measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
overheatingAssistanceConfig \\
Configuration for the UE to report assistance information to inform the gNB about UE detected internal overheating.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
overheatingindicationProhibitTimer \\
Prohibit timer for overheating assistance information reporting. Value in seconds. Value \( s 0 \) means prohibit timer is set to 0 seconds, value s 0 dot 5 means prohibit timer is set to 0.5 seconds, value s 1 means prohibit timer is set to 1 second and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reference TimePreferenceReporting \\
If present, the field indicates the UE is configured to provide reference time assistance information.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
releasePreferenceConfig \\
Configuration for the UE to report assistance information to inform the gNB about the UE's preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rim-RelaxationReportingConfig \\
Configuration for the UE to report the relaxation state of RLM measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
releasePreferenceProhibitTimer \\
Prohibit timer for release preference assistance information reporting. Value in seconds. Value \( s 0 \) means prohibit timer is set to 0 seconds, value s 0 dot 5 means prohibit timer is set to 0.5 seconds, value s 1 means prohibit timer is set to 1 second and so on. Value infinity means that once a UE has reported a release preference, the UE cannot report a release preference again during the RRC connection.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
s-SearchDeltaP-Stationary \\
Parameter "SsearchDeltaP-StationaryConnected" in 5.7.4.4. Value dB3 corresponds to \( 3 \mathrm{~dB}, \mathrm{~dB} 6 \) corresponds to 6 dB and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg-DeactivationPreferenceConfig \\
Configuration of the UE to indicate its preference for SCG deactivation.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
scg -StatePreferenceProhibitTimer \\
Prohibit timer for UE indication of its preference for SCG deactivation. Value in seconds. Value \( s 0 \) means prohibit timer is set to 0 seconds, value \( s 1 \) means prohibit timer is set to 1 second and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sensorNameList \\
Configuration for the UE to report measurements from specific sensors.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-AssistanceConfigNR \\
Indicate whether UE is configured to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sourceDAPS-FailureReporting \\
This field indicates whether the UE shall generate the SHR upon successfully completing the DAPS handover to the target cell and if a radio link failure was experienced in the source PCell while executing the DAPS handover. This field is set in the otherConfig configured by the source cell of the DAPS handover.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
successHO-Config \\
Configuration for the UE to report the successful handover information to the network.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
t-SearchDeltaP-Stationary \\
Parameter "T \( { }_{\text {searchDeltaP-StationaryConnected" }} \) in 5.7.4.4. Value in seconds. Value s5 means 5 seconds, value s10 means 10 seconds and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
thresholdPercentageT304 \\
This field indicates the threshold for the ratio in percentage between the elapsed T304 timer and the configured value of the T304 timer. Value p40 corresponds to 40\%, value p60 corresponds to 60\% and so on. This field is set in the otherConfig configured by the target cell of the handover.
