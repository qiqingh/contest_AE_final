4> consider the access attempt as barred;
\( 1> \) if the access attempt is considered as barred:
\( 2> \) draw a random number 'rand' that is uniformly distributed in the range \( 0 \leq \) rand \( <1 \);
\( 2> \) start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value calculated as follows, using the uacBarringTime included in "UAC barring parameter":
\[
\text { T390 }=(0.7+0.6 \neq \text { rand }) \neq \text { uac-BarringTime. }

5.3.15 RRC connection reject
5.3.15.1 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure upon the reception of \( R R C R \) eject when the UE tries to establish or resume an RRC connection.
5.3.15.2 Reception of the RRCReject by the UE

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T300, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T319, if running;
1> stop timer T319a, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T302, if running;
\( 1> \) reset MAC and release the default MAC Cell Group configuration;
\( 1> \) if waitTime is configured in the RRCReject:
\( 2> \) start timer T302, with the timer value set to the waitTime;
\( 1> \) if \( R R C \) Reject is received in response to a request from upper layers:
\( 2> \) inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories ' 0 ' and ' 2 ';
\( 1> \) if RRCReject is received in response to an RRCSetupRequest:
\( 2> \) inform upper layers about the failure to setup the RRC connection, upon which the procedure ends;
\( 1> \) else if RRCReject is received in response to an RRCResumeRequest or an RRCResumeRequest I:
\( 2> \) if resume is triggered by upper layers:
\( 3> \) inform upper layers about the failure to resume the RRC connection;
\( 2> \) if resume is triggered due to an RNA update; or
\( 2> \) if resume is triggered for SDT and T380 is not running:
\( 3> \) set the variable pendingRNA-Update to true;
\( 2> \) discard the current \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRCenc}} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { int }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key derived in
accordance with 5.3.13.3;
\( 2> \) suspend SRB1 and the radio bearers configured for SDT, if any;
\( 2> \) for each radio bearer configured for SDT:
\( 3> \) indicate PDCP suspend to lower layers;
3> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 [4];
