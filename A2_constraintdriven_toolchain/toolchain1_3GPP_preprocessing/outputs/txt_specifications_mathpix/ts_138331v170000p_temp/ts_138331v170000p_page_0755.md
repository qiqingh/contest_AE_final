\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline EventTriggerConfiginterRAT field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
b2-Threshold1 \\
NR threshold to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event B2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bN-ThresholdEUTRA \\
E-UTRA threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN. In the same eventB2, the network configures the same CHOICE name (rsrp, \( \mathbf{r s r q} \) or sinr) for the MeasTriggerQuantity of the b2-Threshold1 and for the \\
MeasTriggerQuantityEUTRA of the \( b 2 \)-Threshold2EUTRA.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eventld \\
Choice of inter RAT event triggered reporting criteria.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxReportCells \\
Max number of non-serving cells to include in the measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportAmount \\
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportOnLeave \\
Indicates whether or not the UE shall initiate the measurement reporting procedure when the leaving condition is met for a cell in cellsTriggeredList, as specified in 5.5.4.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportQuantity, reportQuantityUTRA-FDD \\
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report. If the field eventB1-UTRA-FDD or eventB2-UTRA-FDD is present, the UE shall ignore the value(s) provided in reportQuantity.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
timeToTrigger \\
Time during which specific criteria for the event needs to be met in order to trigger a measurement report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
bN-ThresholdUTRA-FDD \\
UTRA-FDD threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSCP, EcNO) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN. utra-FDD-RSCP corresponds to CPICH_RSCP in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD. utra-FDD-EcNO corresponds to CPICH_Ec/No in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD. \\
For utra-FDD-RSCP: The actual value is field value -115 dBm . \\
For utra-FDD-EcNO: The actual value is (field value -49 )/ 2 dB .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
\( y \)-Threshold1 \\
NR threshold to be used in measurement report triggering condition for event Y .
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
\( y \)-Threshold 2-Relay \\
L2 U2N Relay threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (i.e. RSRP) to be used in measurement report triggering condition for event number Y.
