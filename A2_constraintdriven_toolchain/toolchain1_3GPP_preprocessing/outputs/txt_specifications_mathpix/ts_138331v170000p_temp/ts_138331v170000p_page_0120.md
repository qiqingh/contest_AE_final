\( 3> \) assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;

\( 2> \) else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT are different from the value indicated in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:

3> include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drbIdentity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT -1 and RX_NEXT -1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;

1> for each DRB that is included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList in the CounterCheck message that is not established:
\( 2> \) include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drbIdentity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding values in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList and the least significant bits set to zero;

1> submit the CounterCheckResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends.
5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
5.3.7.1 General

Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment, successful

The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB/multicast MRB setup or, for [AB, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an RRCSetup according to clause 5.3.3.4.
