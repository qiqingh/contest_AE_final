Editor's NOTE: Whether serving cell quality criterion is configured per Scell for BFD needs RAN4 confirmation.
Editor's NOTE: Current text assumes the low mobility criterion is configured commonly for RLM and BFD. It is FFS whether the low mobility criterion can be configured independently for RLM and BFD.

Editor's NOTE: Values and range of SearchDeltaP-Connected and \( t \)-SearchDeltaP-Connected are still FFS in RAN4.
