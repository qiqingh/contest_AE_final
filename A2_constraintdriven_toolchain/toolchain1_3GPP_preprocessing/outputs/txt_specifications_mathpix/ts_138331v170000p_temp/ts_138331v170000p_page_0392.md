\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SIB1 field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellBarredRedCap1Rx \\
Value barred means that the cell is barred for a RedCap UE with 1 Rx branch, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by non-RedCap UEs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellBarredRedCap2Rx \\
Value barred means that the cell is barred for a RedCap UE with 2 Rx branches, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by non-RedCap UEs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellSelectioninfo \\
Parameters for cell selection related to the serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eCallOverIMS-Support \\
Indicates whether the cell supports eCall over IMS services as defined in TS 23.501 [32]. If absent, eCall over IMS is not supported by the network in the cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
eDRX-Allowed \\
The presence of this field indicates that extended DRX is allowed in the cell for UEs in RRC_IDLE and in RRC_INACTIVE. The UE shall stop using extended DRX if eDRXAllowed is not present.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
featurePriorities \\
Indicates priorities for features, such as RedCap, Slicing, etc. These priorities are used to determine which FeatureCombinationPreambles the UE shall use when a feature maps to more than one FeatureCombinationPreambles, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. A lower value means a higher priority. The network does not signal the same priority for more than one feature. The network signals a priority for all feature that map to at least one FeatureCombinationPreambles.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
halfDuplexRedCap-Allowed \\
FFS: The presence of this field indicates whether the cell supports half-duplex FDD RedCap UEs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
hsdn-Cell \\
This field indicates this is a HSDN cell as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
hyperSFN \\
Indicates hyper SFN which increments by one when the SFN wraps around.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
idleModeMeasurementsEUTRA \\
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for EUTRA idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform EUTRA idle/inactive measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
idieModeMeasurementsNR \\
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for NR idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform NR idlefinactive measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ims-EmergencySupport \\
Indicates whether the cell supports IMS emergency bearer services for UEs in limited service mode. If absent, IMS emergency call is not supported by the network in the cell for UEs in limited service mode.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intraFreqReselectionRedCap \\
Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells for RedCap UEs when this cell is barred, or treated as barred by the RedCap UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. If not present, a RedCap UE treats the cell as barred, i.e.,the UE considers that the cell does not support RedCap.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-QualMin \\
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-QualMinOffset \\
Parameter "Qqualminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qqualminoffset \( = \) field value [dB]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for \( Q_{q u a l m i n o f f s e t} \). Affects the minimum required quality level in the cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-RxLevMin \\
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-RxLevMinOffset \\
Parameter "Qxlevminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value \( Q_{\text {xlevminoffset }}= \) field value * 2 [dB]. If absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for \( Q_{\text {xlevminoffset. }} \) Affects the minimum required Rx level in the cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
q-RxLevMinSUL \\
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
