\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline CSI-AssociatedReportConfiginfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ap-CSI-MultiplexingMode \\
Indicates if the behavior of transmitting aperiodic CSI on the first PUSCH repetitions corresponding to two SRS resource sets is enabled or not.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-IM-ResourcesForinterference \\
CSI-IM-ResourceSet for interference measurement. Entry number in csi-IM-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigid above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on). The indicated CSI-IM-ResourceSet should have exactly the same number of resources like the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-SSB-ResourceSet, csi-SSB-ResourceSet2 \\
CSI-SSB-ResourceSet for channel measurements. Entry number in csi-SSB-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference \\
NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for interference measurement. Entry number in nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by nzp-CSI-RS- \\
ResourcesForinterference in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigld above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
qcl-info, qcl-info2 \\
List of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS. Each TCI-Stateld refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-Stateld and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resourcesForChannelMeasurement (in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above) belong to. First entry in qc/-info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of that NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qclinfo corresponds to second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.1). When this field is absent for aperiodic CSIRS, the UE shall use QCL information included in the "indicated" DL only/Joint TCI state as specified in TS 38.214
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
reportConfigid \\
The reportConfigld of one of the CSI-ReportConfigToAddMod configured in CSI-MeasConfig
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourcesForChannel2 \\
Configures reference signals for channel measurement corresponding to the second resource set for L1-RSRP measurement as configured in IE CSI-ResourceConfig when nrofReportedGroups-r17 is configured in IE CSI-ReportConfig. If this is present, network configures csi-SSB-ResourceSetExt instead of csi-SSB-ResourceSet and the UE ignores csi-SSB-ResourceSet in resourcesForChannel, and the resourcesForChannel configures the reference signals for channel measurement corresponding to the first resource set for L1-RSRP measurement (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). If unifiedtci-StateType is configured, this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
resourceSet \\
NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurements. Entry number in nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfig/d above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline Aperiodic & The field is mandatory present if the NZP-CSI-RS-Resources in the associated resourceSet have the resourceType aperiodic and unifiedtci-StateType is not configured. The field is optional Need R if the NZP-CSI-RS-Resources in the associated resourceSethave the resourceType aperiodic and unifiedtci-StateType is configured. The field is absent otherwise. \\
\hline CSI-IM-ForInterference & This field is mandatory present if the CSI-ReportConfig identified by reportConfigld is configured with csi-IMResourcesForinterference; otherwise it is absent. \\
\hline NZP-CSI-RS-ForInterference & This field is mandatory present if the CSI-ReportConfig identified by reportConfigld is configured with nzp-CSI-RSResourcesForInterference; otherwise it is absent. \\
