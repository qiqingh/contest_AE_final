OffsetDFN is the value \( s l \)-OffsetDFN if configured, otherwise it is zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
\( \mu=0 / 1 / 2 / 3 \) corresponding to the \( 15 / 30 / 60 / 120 \mathrm{kHz} \) of SCS for SL, respectively.
NOTE 1: In case of leap second change event, how UE obtains the scheduled time of leap second change to adjust Tcurrent correspondingly is left to UE implementation. How UE handles to avoid the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to UE implementation.

NOTE 2: Void.
5.8.13 NR sidelink discovery
5.8.13.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to perform sidelink discovery as specified in TS 23.304 [65].
5.8.13.2 Sidelink discovery monitoring

A UE capable of sidelink discovery that is configured by upper layers to monitor NR sidelink discovery messages shall:
\( 1> \) if the frequency used for NR sidelink discovery is included in \( s \) /-FreqInfoToAddModList in RRCReconfiguration message and sl-DiscConfig is included in RRCReconfiguration; or if the frequency used for NR sidelink discovery is included in sl-FreqInfoList included in SIB12 and sl-DiscConfigCommon is included in SIB12:
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured with sl-DiscRxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception included in RRCReconfiguration message with reconfiguration WithSync (i.e. handover):
\( 3> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the resource pool indicated by sl-DiscRxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception in RRCReconfiguration;
\( 2> \) else if the UE is configured with \( s l \)-RxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception included in RRCReconfiguration message with reconfiguration WithSync (i.e. handover):
\( 3> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the resource pool indicated by sl-RxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception in RRCReconfiguration;
\( 2> \) else if the cell chosen for NR sidelink discovery reception provides SIB12:
3> if sl-DiscRxPool for NR sidelink is included in SIB12:
\( 4> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the resource pool indicated by sl-DiscRxPoo for NR sidelink discovery reception in SIB12;

3> else if sl-RxPool for NR sidelink is included in SIB12:
\( 4> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the resource pool indicated by sl-RxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception in SIB12;

1> else:
\( 2> \) if out of coverage on the concerned frequency for NR sidelink discovery:
\( 3> \) configure lower layers to monitor sidelink control information and the corresponding data using the resource pool that were preconfigured by sl-DiscRxPool or sl-RxPool for NR sidelink discovery reception in SL-PreconfigurationNR, as defined in clause 9.3;
5.8.13.3 Sidelink discovery transmission

A UE capable of sidelink discovery that is configured by upper layer to transmit NR sidelink discovery message shall:
\( 1> \) if the frequency used for NR sidelink discovery is included in \( s \) /-FreqInfoToAddModList in \( s \) /ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration message and sl-DiscConfig is included in RRCReconfiguration; or if the frequency used for NR sidelink discovery is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 and slDiscConfigCommon is included in SIB12:
