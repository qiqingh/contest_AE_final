\( 3> \) continue reception of SIB8;
\( 2> \) else if the received values of messageldentifier and/or serialNumber are not the same as any of the pairs for which a warning message is currently being assembled:

3> start assembling a warning message for this messageldentifier and serialNumber pair;
3> start assembling the geographical area coordinates (if any) for this messageldentifier and serialNumber pair;

3> store the received warningMessageSegment;
3> store the received warningAreaCoordinatesSegment (if any);
\( 3> \) continue reception of SIB8;
The UE should discard warningMessageSegment and warningAreaCoordinatesSegment (if any) and the associated values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB8 if the complete warning message and the geographical area coordinates (if any) have not been assembled within a period of 3 hours.

NOTE: The number of warning messages that a UE can re-assemble simultaneously is a function of UE implementation.
5.2.2.4.10 Actions upon reception of SIB9

Upon receiving SIB9 with referenceTimeInfo, the UE may perform the related actions as specified in clause 5.7.1.3.
5.2.2.4.11 Actions upon reception of SIB10

Upon receiving SIB10, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) Forward the \( H R N N \)-list entries with the corresponding PNI-NPN and SNPN identities to upper layers;
5.2.2.4.12 Actions upon reception of SIB11

Upon receiving SIB11, the UE shall:
1> if in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, and T331 is running:
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.1a;
5.2.2.4.13 Actions upon reception of SIB12

Upon receiving SIB12, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE has stored at least one segment of SIB12 and the value tag of SIB12 has changed since a previous segment was stored:
\( 2> \) discard all stored segments;
1> store the segment;
1> if all segments have been received:
2> assemble SIB12-IEs from the received segments;
\( 2> \) if \( s l \)-FreqInfoList is included in \( s l \)-ConfigCommonNR:
\( 3> \) if configured to receive NR sidelink communication:
\( 4> \) use the resource pool(s) indicated by \( s l \)-RxPool for NR sidelink communication reception, as specified in 5.8.7;
\( 3> \) if configured to transmit NR sidelink communication:
