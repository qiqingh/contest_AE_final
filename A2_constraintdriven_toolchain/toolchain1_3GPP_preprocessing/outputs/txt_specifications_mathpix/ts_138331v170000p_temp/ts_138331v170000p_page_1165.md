Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElementl as shown in the above example:
- The InformationElementl is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this [E. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElementl (i.e. InformationElementl-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.
- The value 4 - \( v 880 \) is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field 1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare 3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field l.
- Within the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElementl, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the fieldl and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3\( r 9 \) is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement 3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement \( 3-r 10 \) in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.
A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
```
-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE \
    fieldl
    field2
    field3
    nonCriticalExtension
}
    InformationElementl,
    InformationElement2,
    InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
    RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL
}
```
