Indicates the TCI state for PDCCH for each configured CORESET of the DL BWP to be activated at SCell activation, to be activated for the PSCell at SCG activation and/or to be used for BFD, RLM and measurements while the SCG is deactivated. The list includes exactly as many entries as CORESETs configured in this BWP, ordered by increasing values of ControlResourceSet-ld, i.e. the first entry indicates the TCI state for the configured CORESET with the lowest ControlResourceset-/d value, the second value indicates the TCI states for the configured CORESET with the second lowest ControlResourceset-Id value, and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-TCI \\
Indicates TCI states for PDSCH reception at SCell addition/activation or of the PSCell at SCG activation. This field includes exactly one bit for each configured TCI state in this BWP ordered by increasing values of TC/-State/d, i.e. the first bit indicates the activation state of the TCI state with the lowest TC/-State/d value, the second value indicates the activation status of the TCI state with the second lowest TCI-State-Id value, and so on. A bit set to 0 indicates that the corresponding TCI state is deactivated, a bit set to 1 indicates that the TCl state is activated.

- TCI-State

The IE TCI-State associates one or two DL reference signals with a corresponding quasi-colocation (QCL) type. If additionalPCI is configured for the reference signal, same value is configured for both DL reference signals.
