\( 2> \) stop timer T390 for all access categories;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
\( 1> \) if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra:
\( 2> \) consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
\( 2> \) forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1> else if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra-fdd:
\( 2> \) consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;
\( 2> \) forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
\( 1> \) access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.
5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from NR

Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
\( 1> \) reset MAC;
\( 1> \) stop all timers that are running except T325, T330 and T400;
1> release ran-NotificationArealnfo, if stored;
\( 1> \) release the AS security context including the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCenc }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {RRCInt }} \) key, the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPint }} \) key and the \( \mathrm{K}_{\text {UPenc }} \) key, if stored;
\( 1> \) release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the MAC configuration;
\( 1> \) release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE: PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during inter-RAT intra-system handover when fullConfig is not present) is used, are not released as part of this procedure.
\( 1> \) if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra and the nas-SecurityParamFromNR is included: or
1> if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra-fdd:
\( 2> \) indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together with the release cause 'other'.
5.4.3.5 Mobility from NR failure

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target radio access technology:
\( 2> \) if the targetRAT-Type in the received MobilityFromNRCommand is set to eutra and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:
\( 3> \) store handover failure information in VarRLF-Report according to 5.3.10.5;
\( 2> \) if voiceFallbackIndication is included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message:
3> attempt to select an E-UTRA cell:
4> if a suitable E-UTRA cell is selected:
\( 5> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'RRC connection failure';
\( 4> \) else:
