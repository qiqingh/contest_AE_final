Figure 5.8.9.2.1-1: Sidelink UE capability transfer
5.8.9.2.2 Initiation

The UE may initiate the sidelink UE capability transfer procedure upon indication from upper layer when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information.
5.8.9.2.3 Actions related to transmission of the UECapabilityEnquirySidelink by the UE

The initiating UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityEnquirySidelink message as follows:
1> include in UE radio access capabilities for sidelink within ue-CapabilityInformationSidelink, if needed;
NOTE 1: It is up to initiating UE to decide whether ue-CapabilityInformationSidelink should be included.
\( 1> \) set frequencyBandListFilterSidelink to include frequency bands for which the peer UE is requested to provide supported bands and band combinations;

NOTE 2: The initiating UE is not allowed to send the UECapabilityEnquirySidelink message without including the field frequencyBandListFilterSidelink.

1> submit the UECapabilityEnquirySidelink message to lower layers for transmission.
5.8.9.2.4 Actions related to reception of the UECapabilityEnquirySidelink by the UE

The peer UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityInformationSidelink message as follows:
\( 1> \) include UE radio access capabilities for sidelink within \( u e \)-CapabilityInformationSidelink;
\( 1> \) compile a list of "candidate band combinations" only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilterSidelink, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilterSidelink (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on).
\( 1> \) include into supportedBandCombinationListSidelinkNR as many band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;

1> include the received frequencyBandListFilterSidelink in the field appliedFreqBandListFilter of the requested UE capability;

1> submit the UECapabilityInformationSidelink message to lower layers for transmission.
NOTE: If the UE cannot include all band combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which band combinations it prioritizes.
5.8.9.3 Sidelink radio link failure related actions

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) upon indication from sidelink RLC entity that the maximum number of retransmissions for a specific destination has been reached; or

1> upon T400 expiry for a specific destination; or
