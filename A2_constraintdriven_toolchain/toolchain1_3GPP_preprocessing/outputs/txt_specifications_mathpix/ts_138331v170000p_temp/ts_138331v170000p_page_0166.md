\( 2> \) else, set parameter csi-RSRP of s-MeasureConfig within VarMeasConfig to the lowest value of the RSRP ranges indicated by the received value of \( s \)-MeasureConfig.
5.5.2.2 Measurement identity removal

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each measId included in the received measIdToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in VarMeasConfig:
\( 2> \) remove the entry with the matching measld from the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId.

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the measIdToRemoveList includes any measId value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.5.2.3 Measurement identity addition/modification

The network applies the procedure as follows:
- configure a measld only if the corresponding measurement object, the corresponding reporting configuration and the corresponding quantity configuration, are configured.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each measId included in the received measIdToAddModList:
