\( 5> \) store the radio link failure information in the VarRLF-Report as described in clause 5.3.10.5;
\( 5> \) if T316 is configured; and
5> if SCG transmission is not suspended; and
\( 5> \) if the SCG is not deactivated; and
\( 5> \) if neither PSCell change nor PSCell addition is ongoing (i.e. timer T304 for the NR PSCell is not running in case of NR-DC or timer T307 of the E-UTRA PSCell is not running as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.10.10, in NE-DC):
\( 6> \) initiate the MCG failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.3b to report MCG radio link failure.
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7.
Upon L2 U2N Relay UE detecting radio link failure, it either triggers PC5-S release or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 5.8.9.10.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) upon T310 expiry in PSCell; or
1> upon T312 expiry in PSCell; or
1> upon random access problem indication from SCG MAC; or
1> upon indication from SCG RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached; or
\( 1> \) if connected as an [AB-node, upon BH RLF indication received on BAP entity from the SCG; or
1> upon consistent uplink LBT failure indication from SCG MAC:
\( 2> \) if the indication is from SCG RLC and CA duplication is configured and activated for SCG, and for the corresponding logical channel allowedServingCells only includes SCell(s):
\( 3> \) initiate the failure information procedure as specified in 5.7 .5 to report RLC failure.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) consider radio link failure to be detected for the SCG, i.e. SCG RLF;
3> if MCG transmission is not suspended:
4> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.3 to report SCG radio link failure.
\( 3> \) else:
4> if the UE is in NR-DC:
\( 5> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
4> else (the UE is in (NG)EN-DC):
\( 5> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.7;
5.3.10.4 RLF cause determination

The UE shall set the iff-Cause in the VarRLF-Report as follows:
\( 1> \) if the UE declares radio link failure due to T310 expiry:
\( 2> \) set the rlf-Cause as t310-Expiry;
\( 1> \) else if the UE declares radio link failure due to the random access problem indication from MCG MAC:
