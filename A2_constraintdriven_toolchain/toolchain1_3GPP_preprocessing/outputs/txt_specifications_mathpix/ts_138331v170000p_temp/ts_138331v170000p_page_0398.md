\hline SL-RxDRX-Report field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-DRX-ConfigFromTx \\
Indicates the sidelink DRX configuration received from peer UE for NR sidelink unicast communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-RxinterestedQoS-infoList \\
Indicates the QoS profile for which UE reports its interested service to the network, for NR sidelink groupcast or broadcast communication.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline SL-TxResourceReqDisc field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-DestinationIdentityDisc \\
This field is used to indicate the destination L2 ID for which the TX resource request and allocation from the network are concerned for discovery by L2 U2N Remote UE, or L2 U2N Relay UE, or L3 U2N Relay UE, or L3 U2N Remote UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-Sourceldentity-RelayUE \\
This field is used to indicate the source L2 ID of relay-related discovery transmission by L2 U2N Relay UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-TxinterestedFreqListDisc \\
Each entry of this field indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit NR sidelink discovery. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-Freq/nfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqlnfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list. In this release, only one entry can be included in the list.
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-TxResourceReqCommRelay field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-DestinationidentityL2U2N \\
This field is used to indicate the destination L2 ID for which the TX resource request and allocation from the network are concerned for the established PC5 link for relay by L2 U2N Relay UE, or L3 U2N Relay UE, or L3 U2N Remote UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-LocallD-Request \\
This field is used to request local UE ID for the corresponding destination by the L2 U2N Relay UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-TxinterestedFreqListL2U2N \\
Each entry of this field indicates the index of frequency on which the UE is interested to transmit NR sidelink communication for established PC5 link for relay. The value 1 corresponds to the frequency of first entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12, the value 2 corresponds to the frequency of second entry in sl-FreqinfoList broadcast in SIB12 and so on. In this release, only value 1 can be included in the interested frequency list. In this release, only one entry can be included in the list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-Pagingidentity-RemoteUE \\
This field is used to indicate the paging UE ID for the corresponding destination by the L2 U2N Relay UE.
