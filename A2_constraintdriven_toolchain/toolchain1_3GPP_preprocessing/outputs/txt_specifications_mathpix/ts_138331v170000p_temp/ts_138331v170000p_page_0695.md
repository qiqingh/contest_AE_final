\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PUCCH-FormatConfig, PUCCH-FormatConfigExt field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
additionalDMRS \\
If the field is present, the UE enables 2 DMRS symbols per hop of a PUCCH Format 3 or 4 if both hops are more than \( X \) symbols when FH is enabled ( \( X=4 \) ). And it enables 4 DMRS symbols for a PUCCH Format 3 or 4 with more than \( 2 \mathrm{X}+1 \) symbols when FH is disabled ( \( \mathrm{X}=4 \) ). The field is not applicable for format 0 , 1 and 2 . See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
intersiotFrequencyHopping \\
If the field is present, the UE enables inter-slot frequency hopping when PUCCH Format \( 0,1,3 \) or 4 is repeated over multiple slots. For long PUCCH over multiple slots, the intra and inter slot frequency hopping cannot be enabled at the same time for a UE. The field is not applicable for format 2. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.6.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxCodeRate \\
Max coding rate to determine how to feedback UCI on PUCCH for format 2, 3 or 4. The field is not applicable for format 0 and 1. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxCodeRateLP \\
Max coding rate to determine how to feedback UCI on PUCCH for format 2, 3 or 4. The field is not applicable for format 0 and 1 . This field configures additional max code rate in the second entry of PUCCH-ConfigurationList-r16 for multiplexing low-priority (LP) HARQ-ACK and high-priority (HP) UCI in a PUCCH as described Clause 9.2.5.3 of TS 38.213 [13]. The field is absent for the first entry of PUCCH-ConfigurationList-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSlots \\
Number of slots with the same PUCCH. When the field is absent the UE applies the value \( n 1 \). The field is not applicable for format 2. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.6.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pi2BPSK \\
If the field is present, the UE uses pi/2 BPSK for UCI symbols instead of QPSK for PUCCH. The field is not applicable for format 0, 1 and 2. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
rb-Setindex \\
Indicates the RB set where PUCCH resource is allocated.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI \\
If the field is present, the UE uses simultaneous transmission of CSI and HARQ-ACK feedback with or without SR with PUCCH Format 2, 3 or 4. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5. When the field is absent the UE applies the value off. The field is not applicable for format 0 and 1.
