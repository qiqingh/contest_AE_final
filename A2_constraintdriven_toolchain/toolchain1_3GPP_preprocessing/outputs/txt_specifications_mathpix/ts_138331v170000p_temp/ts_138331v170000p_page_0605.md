\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasObjectNR field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation \\
Absolute threshold for the consolidation of measurement results per CSI-RS resource(s) from L1 filter(s). The field is used for the derivation of cell measurement results as described in 5.5.3.3 and the reporting of beam measurement information per CSI-RS resource as described in 5.5.5.2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation \\
Absolute threshold for the consolidation of measurement results per SS/PBCH block(s) from L1 filter(s). The field is used for the derivation of cell measurement results as described in 5.5.3.3 and the reporting of beam measurement information per SS/PBCH block index as described in 5.5.5.2.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedCells ToAddModList \\
List of cells to add/modify in the allow-list of cells. It applies only to SSB resources.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
allowedCells ToRemoveList \\
List of cells to remove from the allow-list of cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
associatedMeasGapSSB \\
Indicates the associated measurement gap for SSB measuring identified by ssb-ConfigMobility in this measurement object. When multiple MeasObjectNR with the same SSB frequency are configured, the network configures the same measurement gap ID in this field for each MeasObjectNR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
associatedMeasGapCSIRS \\
Indicates the associated measurement gap for CSI-RS measuring identified by csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility in this measurement object.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellsToAddModList \\
List of cells to add/modify in the cell list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cellsToRemoveList \\
List of cells to remove from the cell list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
excludedCellsToAddModList \\
List of cells to add/modify in the exclude-list of cells. It applies only to SSB resources.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
excludedCellsToRemoveList \\
List of cells to remove from the exclude-list of cells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
freqBandindicatorNR \\
The frequency band in which the SSB and/or CSI-RS indicated in this MeasObjectNR are located and according to which the UE shall perform the RRM measurements. This field is always provided when the network configures measurements with this MeasObjectNR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measCyclePSCell \\
The parameter is used only when the PSCell is configured on the frequency indicated by the measObjectNR and the SCG is deactivated, see TS 38.133 [14]. The field may also be configured when the PSCell is not configured on that frequency.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measCycleSCell \\
The parameter is used only when an SCell is configured on the frequency indicated by the measObjectNR and is in deactivated state, see TS 38.133 [14]. gNB configures the parameter whenever an SCell is configured on the frequency indicated by the measObject \( N R \), but the field may also be signalled when an SCell is not configured. Value sf160 corresponds to 160 sub-frames, value sf256 corresponds to 256 sub-frames and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofCSInrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage \\
Indicates the maximum number of measurement results per beam based on CSI-RS resources to be averaged. The same value applies for each detected cell associated with this MeasObjectNR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage \\
Indicates the maximum number of measurement results per beam based on SS/PBCH blocks to be averaged. The same value applies for each detected cell associated with this MeasObject.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
offsetMO \\
Offset values applicable to all measured cells with reference signal(s) indicated in this MeasObjectNR.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
quantityConfigIndex \\
Indicates the n -th element of quantityConfigNR-List provided in MeasConfig.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
referenceSignalConfig \\
RS configuration for SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
