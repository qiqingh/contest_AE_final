\( 3> \) replace the nextHopChainingCount with the value associated with the current \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \);
\( 2> \) else:
3> store in the UE Inactive AS Context the nextHopChainingCount received in the RRCRelease message, the current \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { int }} \) keys, the ROHC state, the stored QoS flow to DRB mapping rules, the application layer measurement configuration, the C-RNTI used in the source PCell, the cellldentity and the physical cell identity of the source PCell, the spCellConfigCommon within ReconfigurationWithSync of the NR PSCell (if configured) and all other parameters configured except for:
- parameters within ReconfigurationWithSync of the PCell;
- parameters within ReconfigurationWithSync of the NR PSCell, if configured;
- parameters within MobilityControllnfoSCG of the E-UTRA PSCell, if configured;
- servingCellConfigCommonSIB;
- sl-L2RelayUEConfig, if configured;
- sl-L2RemoteUEConfig, if configured;

3> store any previously or subsequently received application layer measurement reports for which no segment, or full message, has been submitted to lower layers for transmission;

NOTE 2: NR sidelink communication related configurations and logged measurement configuration are not stored as UE Inactive AS Context, when UE enters RRC_INACTIVE.
\( 2> \) suspend all SRB(s) and DRB(s) and multicast MRB(s), except SRB0;
\( 2> \) indicate PDCP suspend to lower layers of all DRBs and multicast MRBs;
\( 2> \) if the \( t 380 \) is included:
3> start timer T380, with the timer value set to \( t 380 \);
\( 2> \) if the RRCRelease message is including the waitTime:
\( 3> \) start timer T302 with the value set to the waitTime;
\( 3> \) inform upper layers that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories ' 0 ' and ' 2 ';
\( 2> \) if T390 is running:
3> stop timer T390 for all access categories;
\( 3> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
\( 2> \) indicate the suspension of the RRC connection to upper layers;
\( 2> \) enter RRC_INACTIVE and perform cell selection as specified in TS 38.304 [20];
1> else
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with the release cause 'other'.
5.3.8.4 T320 expiry

The UE shall:
1> if T320 expires:
\( 2> \) if stored, discard the cell reselection priority information provided by the cellReselectionPriorities or inherited from another RAT;
\( 2> \) apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the system information.
