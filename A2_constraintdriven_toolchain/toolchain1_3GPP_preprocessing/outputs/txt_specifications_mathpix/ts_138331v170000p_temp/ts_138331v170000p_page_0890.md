\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline FeatureSetDownlink field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
featureSetListPerDownlinkCC \\
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual DL carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refer to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-/d in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassDL, except if indicating additional functionality by reducing the number of FeatureSetDowninkPerCC-Id in the feature set (see NOTE 1 in FeatureSetCombination IE description). The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetDowninkPerCC-Id in this list.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
supportedSRS-Resources \\
Indicates supported SRS resources for SRS carrier switching to the band associated with this FeatureSetDownink. The UE is only allowed to set this field for a band with associated FeatureSetUplinkld set to 0.

- FeatureSetDownlinkId

The IE FeatureSetDownlinkld identifies a downlink feature set. The FeatureSetDownlinkld of a FeatureSetDownlink is the index position of the FeatureSetDownlink in the featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSets [E. The first element in that list is referred to by FeatureSetDownlinkld \( =1 \). The FeatureSetDownlinkl \( d=0 \) is not used by an actual FeatureSetDownlink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

- FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC

The IE FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC indicates a set of features that the UE supports on the corresponding carrier of one band entry of a band combination.
