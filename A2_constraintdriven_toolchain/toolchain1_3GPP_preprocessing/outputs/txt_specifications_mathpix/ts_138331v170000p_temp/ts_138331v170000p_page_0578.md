\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline LocationMeasurementinfo field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
carrierFreq \\
The EARFCN value of the carrier received from upper layers for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measPRS-Offset \\
Indicates the requested gap offset for performing RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA. It is the smallest subframe offset from the beginning of subframe 0 of SFN=0 of the serving cell of the requested gap for measuring PRS positioning occasions in the carrier frequency carrierFreq for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements. The PRS positioning occasion information is received from upper layers. The value of measPRS-Offset is obtained by mapping the starting subframe of the PRS positioning occasion in the measured cell onto the corresponding subframe in the serving cell and is calculated as the serving cell's number of subframes from SFN=0 mod 40. \\
The UE shall take into account any additional time required by the UE to start PRS measurements on the other carrier when it does this mapping for determining the measPRS-Offset. \\
NOTE: Figure 6.2.2-1 in TS 36.331[10] illustrates the measPRS-Offset field.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
dI-PRS-PointA \\
The ARFCN value of the carrier received from upper layers for which the UE needs to perform the NR DL-PRS measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nr-MeasPRS-RepetitionAndOffset \\
Indicates the gap periodicity in ms and offset in number of subframes of the requested measurement gap for performing NR DL-PRS measurements.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nr-MeasPRS-length \\
Indicates measurement gap length in ms of the requested measurement gap for performing NR DL-PRS measurements. The measurement gap length is according to in Table 9.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14].
