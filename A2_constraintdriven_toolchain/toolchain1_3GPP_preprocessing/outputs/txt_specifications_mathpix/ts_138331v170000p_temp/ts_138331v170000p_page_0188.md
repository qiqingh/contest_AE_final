\( 2> \) if report Type is set to report \( C G I \) :
\( 3> \) if the UE acquired the SIBI or SystemInformationBlockTypel for the requested cell; or
\( 3> \) if the UE detects that the requested NR cell is not transmitting SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13):
\( 4> \) stop timer T321;
\( 4> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measld;
\( 4> \) set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld to 0;
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
\( 2> \) upon the expiry of T321 for this measld:
\( 3> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measld;
\( 3> \) set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld to 0;
\( 3> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 .
\( 2> \) upon the expiry of T322 for this measld:
\( 3> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 .
5.5.4.2 Event A1 (Serving becomes better than threshold)

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A1-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
\( 1> \) consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A1-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
\( 1> \) for this measurement, consider the NR serving cell corresponding to the associated measObjectNR associated with this event.

Inequality A1-1 (Entering condition)
Ms - Hys > Thresh
Inequality A1-2 (Leaving condition)
\( M s+H y s< \) Thresh
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
\( M s \) is the measurement result of the serving cell, not taking into account any offsets.
Hys is the hysteresis parameter for this event (i.e hysteresis as defined within reportConfigNR for this event).
Thresh is the threshold parameter for this event (i.e. al-Threshold as defined within reportConfigNR for this event).
\( M s \) is expressed in dBm in case of RSRP, or in dB in case of RSRQ and RS-SINR.
Hys is expressed in dB.
Thresh is expressed in the same unit as \( M s \).
5.5.4.3 Event A2 (Serving becomes worse than threshold)

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A2-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
\( 1> \) consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when condition A2-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
