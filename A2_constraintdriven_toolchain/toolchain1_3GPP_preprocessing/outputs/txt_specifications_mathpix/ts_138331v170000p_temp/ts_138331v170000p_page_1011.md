\hline SL-PBPS-CPS-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-Additional-PBPS-Occasion \\
Indicates that UE additionally monitors periodic sensing occasions that correspond to a set of values. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-AllowedResourceSelectionConfig \\
Indicates the allowed resource selection mechanism(s), i.e. full sensing only, partial sensing only, random resource selection only, or any combination(s) thereof. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4). Only c1, c4, c5 or c7 can be configured for a Rel-16 resource pool. \\
c1: only full sensing allowed \\
c2: only partial sensing allowed \\
c3: only random selection allowed \\
c4: full sensing+random selection allowed \\
c5: full sensing+ partial sensing allowed \\
c6: partial sensing + random selection allowed \\
c7: full sensing + partial sensing + random selection allowed.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-CPS-WindowAperiodic \\
Parameter that indicates the minimum size of contiguous partial sensing window in logical slot units for a resource (re)selection procedure and re-evaluation/pre-emption checking triggered by aperiodic transmission. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4). If not configured, the size of contiguous partial sensing window in logical slot units is 31.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-CPS-WindowPeriodic \\
Indicates the size of contiguous partial sensing window in logical slot units when UE performs periodic-based and contiguous partial sensing for a resource (re)selection procedure triggered by periodic transmission. If not configured, the size of contiguous partial sensing window in logical slot units is 31.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-DefaultCBR-PartialSensing \\
Indicates default value of SL CBR measurement for a UE that is configured to perform partial sensing by its higher layer (including when SL DRX is configured) if the number of SL RSSI measurement slots over CBR measurement window is below [minNumRssiSlots], (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.6). Value 0 corresponds to 0 , value 1 to 0.01 , value 2 to 0.02 , and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-DefaultCBR-RandomSelection \\
Indicates default value of CBR measurement for a UE that performs random resource selection if no SL CBR measurement result over SL CBR measurement window, (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.6). Value 0 corresponds to 0 , value 1 to 0.01 , value 2 to 0.02 , and so on.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-MinNumCandidateSlotsAperiodic \\
Indicates the minimum number of \( Y^{\prime} \) slots that are included in the possible candidate resources corresponding to periodic-based partial sensing and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection triggered by aperiodic transmission. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-MinNumCandidateSlotsPeriodic \\
Indicates the minimum number of \( Y \) slots that are included in the possible candidate resources.corresponding to periodic-based partial sensing for resource (re)selection triggered by periodic transmission. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-MinNumRssiMeasurementSlots \\
Indicates a threshold for a minimum number of SL RSSI measurement slots over CBR measurement window for which the SL RSSI is measured for a UE that is configured to perform partial sensing by its higher layer (including when SL DRX is configured). (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.6).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PartialSensinginactiveTime \\
Indicates whether or not UE is required to perform SL reception of PSCCH and RSRP measurement for partial sensing on slots in SL DRX inactive time when partial sensing is configured by its higher layer. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PBPS-OccasionReservePeriodList \\
Indicates the subset of periodicity values from sl-ResourceReservePeriodList used to determine periodic sensing occasions in periodic-based partial sensing. If not configured, all periodicity values from sl-ResourceReservePeriodList are used to determine periodic sensing occasions in periodic-based partial sensing.(see TS 38.214 [19], clause 8.1.4).
