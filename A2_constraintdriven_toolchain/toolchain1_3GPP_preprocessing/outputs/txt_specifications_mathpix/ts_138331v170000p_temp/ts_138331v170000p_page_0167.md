\( 3> \) replace the entry with the value received for this measld;
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) add a new entry for this measId within the VarMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
\( 2> \) stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId;

NOTE 1: If the measld associated with reportConfig for conditional reconfiguration is modified, the conditions are considered to be not fulfilled as specified in 5.3.5.13.4.
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to reportCGI in the reportConfig associated with this measld:
\( 3> \) if the measObject associated with this measld concerns E-UTRA:
\( 4> \) if the useAutonomousGaps is included in the reportConfig associated with this measId:
\( 5> \) start timer T321 with the timer value set to 200 ms for this measld;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) start timer T321 with the timer value set to 1 second for this measld;
\( 3> \) if the measObject associated with this measld concerns NR:
4 if the measObject associated with this measld concerns FR1:
\( 5> \) if the useAutonomousGaps is included in the reportConfig associated with this measld:
\( 6> \) start timer T321 with the timer value set to 2 seconds for this measld;
\( 5> \) else:
6> start timer T321 with the timer value set to 2 seconds for this measld;
4 if the measObject associated with this measld concerns FR2:
\( 5> \) if the useAutonomousGaps is included in the reportConfig associated with this measld:
\( 6> \) start timer T321 with the timer value set to 5 seconds for this measld;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) start timer T321 with the timer value set to 16 seconds for this measld.
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to reportSFTD in the reportConfigNR associated with this measId and the drx-SFTDNeighMeas is included:
\( 3> \) if the measObject associated with this measld concerns FR1:
4 start timer T322 with the timer value set to 3 seconds for this measld;
\( 3> \) if the measObject associated with this measld concerns FR2:
\( 4> \) start timer T322 with the timer value set to 24 seconds for this measld.
