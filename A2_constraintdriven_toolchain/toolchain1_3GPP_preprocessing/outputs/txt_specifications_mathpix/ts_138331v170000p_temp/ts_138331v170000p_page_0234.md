\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on DRX parameters of the cell group and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with drx-Preference for the cell group since it was configured to provide its preference on DRX parameters of the cell group for power saving; or
\( 2> \) if the current \( d r x \)-Preference information for the cell group is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including \( d r x \)-Preference for the cell group and timer T346a associated with the cell group is not running:

3> start the timer T346a with the timer value set to the drx-PreferenceProhibitTimer of the cell group;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the current dræ-Preference;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference on the maximum aggregated band width of a cell group for power saving:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the maximum aggregated bandwidth of the cell group and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with maxBW-Preference and/or maxBW-PreferenceFR2-2 for the cell group since it was configured to provide its preference on the maximum aggregated bandwidth of the cell group for power saving; or
\( 2> \) if the current maxBW-Preference information for the cell group is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including maxBW-Preference and/or maxBW-PreferenceFR2-2for the cell group and timer T346b associated with the cell group is not running:

3> start the timer T346b with the timer value set to the maxBW-PreferenceProhibitTimer of the cell group;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide the current maxB W-Preference and/or maxB W-PreferenceFR2-2;

1> if configured to provide its preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers of a cell group for power saving:

2 if the UE has a preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers of the cell group and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with maxCC-Preference for the cell group since it was configured to provide its preference on the maximum number of secondary component carriers of the cell group for power saving; or
\( 2> \) if the current maxCC-Preference information for the cell group is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including maxCC-Preference for the cell group and timer T346c associated with the cell group is not running:

3> start the timer T346c with the timer value set to the maxCC-PreferenceProhibitTimer of the cell group;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the current maxCC-Preference;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference on the maximum number of MIMO layers of a cell group for power saving:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the maximum number of MIMO layers of the cell group and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistancelnformation message with maxMIMO-LayerPreference and/or maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceFR2-2 for the cell group since it was configured to provide its preference on the maximum number of MIMO layers of the cell group for power saving; or
\( 2> \) if the current maxMIMO-LayerPreference information for the cell group is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including maxMIMO-LayerPreference and/or maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceFR2-2 for the cell group and timer T346d associated with the cell group is not running:

3> start the timer T346d with the timer value set to the maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceProhibitTimer of the cell group;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7.4.3 to provide the current maxMIMO-LayerPreference and/or maxMIMO-LayerPreferenceFR2-2;
