\( 5> \) include the sigLogMeasConfigAvailable in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message and set it according to the following:
\( 6> \) if T330 timer is running:
\( 7> \) set sigLogMeasConfigAvailable to true in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 6> \) else:
\( 7> \) set sigLogMeasConfigAvailable to false in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 4> \) include the \( \log \) MeasAvailable in the RRCReconfiguration Complete message;
4 if Bluetooth measurement results are included in the logged measurements the UE has available for NR:
\( 5> \) include the logMeasAvailableBT in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 4> \) if WLAN measurement results are included in the logged measurements the UE has available for NR:
\( 5> \) include the \( \log M e a s A v a i l a b l e W L A N \) in the RRCReconfiguration Complete message;
\( 3> \) if the sigLoggedMeasType in VarLogMeasReport is included:

\( 5> \) set sigLogMeasConfigAvailable to true in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) if the UE has logged measurements available for NR:
\( 6> \) set sigLogMeasConfigAvailable to false in the RRCReconfiguration Complete message;
\( 3> \) if the UE has connection establishment failure or connection resume failure information available in VarConnEstFailReport or VarConnEstFailReportList and if the RPLMN is equal to plmn-Identity stored in VarConnEstFailReport or VarConnEstFailReportList:
\( 4> \) include connEstFaillnfoAvailable in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 3> \) if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report; or
\( 3> \) if the UE has radio link failure or handover failure information available in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10] and if the UE is capable of cross-RAT RLF reporting and if the RPLMN is included in plmnIdentityList stored in VarRLF-Report of TS 36.331 [10]:
\( 4> \) include rff-InfoAvailable in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 3> \) if the UE was configured with successHO-Config when connected to the source PCell; and
\( 3> \) if the applied RRCReconfiguration is not due to a conditional reconfiguration execution upon cell selection performed while timer T311 was running, as defined in 5.3.7.3:
\( 4> \) perform the actions for the successful handover report determination as specified in clause 5.7.10.6, upon successfully completing the Random Access procedure triggered for the reconfiguration WithSync in spCellConfig of the MCG;
\( 3> \) if the UE has successful handover information available in VarSuccessHO-Report and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarSuccessHO-Report:
\( 4> \) include successHO-InfoAvailable in the RRCReconfigurationComplete message;
\( 2> \) if the RRCReconfiguration message was received via SRB1, but not within mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup or EUTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration or E-UTRA RRCConnectionResume:
\( 3> \) if the UE is configured to provide the measurement gap requirement information of NR target bands:
