5.3.7.6 T311 expiry

Upon T311 expiry, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the procedure was initiated due to radio link failure or handover failure:
\( 2> \) set the noSuitableCellFound in the VarRLF-Report to true;
1> perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.
5.3.7.7 T301 expiry or selected cell no longer suitable

The UE shall:
1> if timer T301 expires; or
1> if the selected cell becomes no longer suitable according to the cell selection criteria as specified in TS 38.304
[20]:
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.
