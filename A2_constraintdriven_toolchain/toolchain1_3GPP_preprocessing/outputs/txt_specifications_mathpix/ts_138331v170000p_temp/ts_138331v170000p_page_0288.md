The purpose of this procedure is to modify a PC5-RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release sidelink DRBs, to (re-)configure NR sidelink measurement and reporting, to (re-)configure sidelink CSI reference signal resources and CSI reporting latency bound.

The UE may initiate the sidelink RRC reconfiguration procedure and perform the operation in clause 5.8.9.1.2 on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in following cases:
- the release of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
- the establishment of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
- the modification for the parameters included in SLRB-Config of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
- the release of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.1;
- the establishment of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.2;
- the modification for the parameters included in SL-RLC-ChannelConfig-PC5 of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.2;
- the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement and report.
- the (re-)configuration of the sidelink CSI reference signal resources and CSI reporting latency bound;
- the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform sidelink DRX.

In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in RRCReconfiguration (if any). In RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in
