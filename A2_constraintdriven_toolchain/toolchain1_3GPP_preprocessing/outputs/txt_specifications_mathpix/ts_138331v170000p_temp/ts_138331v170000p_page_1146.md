Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN. 1
A. 1 Introduction

The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A. 2 Procedural specification
A.2.1 General principles

The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.

Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2 More detailed aspects

The following more detailed conventions should be used:
- Bullets:
- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';-
- Conditions:
- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1, or cond2.
