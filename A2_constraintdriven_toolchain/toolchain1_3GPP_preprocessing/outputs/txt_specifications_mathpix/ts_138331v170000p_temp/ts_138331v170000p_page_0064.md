1> if any message is received from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as specified in 9-1-1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;

For V2X sidelink communication, an RRC connection is initiated only when the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS 36.331 [10] are met.

NOTE: Upper layers initiate an RRC connection. The interaction with NAS is left to UE implementation.
5.3.3.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request establishment of an RRC connection while the UE is in RRC_IDLE and it has acquired essential system information, or for sidelink communication as specified in clause 5.3.3.1a.

The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as specified in clause 5.2 .2 .2 before initiating this procedure.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more Access Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:
\( 2> \) perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper layers;
\( 3> \) if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
1> if the UE is connected with a L2 U2N Relay UE via PC5-RRC connection (i.e. the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE):
\( 2> \) apply the specified configuration of SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4;
\( 2> \) apply the SDAP configuration and PDCP configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2 for SRB0;
\( 1> \) else: \( 2> \) apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIBI;
\( 2> \) apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
\( 2> \) apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;
\( 2> \) apply the timeAlignmentTimerCommon included in SIB1;
\( 1> \) start timer T300;
\( 1> \) initiate transmission of the RRCSetupRequest message in accordance with 5.3.3.3;
5.3.3.3 Actions related to transmission of RRCSetupRequest message

The UE shall set the contents of RRCSetupRequest message as follows:
\( 1> \) set the ue-Identity as follows:
\( 2> \) if upper layers provide a 5 G-S-TMSI:
3> set the ue-Identity to ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part 1;
2> else:
\( 3> \) draw a 39 -bit random value in the range \( 0.2^{39}-1 \) and set the ue-Identity to this value;
NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the \( 5 G \)-S-TMSI if the UE is registered in the TA of the current cell.
\( 1> \) if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release with redirect with mpsPriorityIndication (either in NR or E-UTRAN):
\( 2> \) set the establishmentCause to mps-PriorityAccess;
