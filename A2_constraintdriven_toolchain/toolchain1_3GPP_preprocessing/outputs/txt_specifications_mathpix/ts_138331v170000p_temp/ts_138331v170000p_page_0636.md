Indicates the serving cell which contains the target SSB (associated with the initial DL BWP) to be measured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapindicationintra \\
Indicates whether measurement gap or NCSG is required for the UE to perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements on the concerned serving cell. Value gap indicates that a measurement gap is needed if any of the UE configured BWPs do not contain the frequency domain resources of the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Value ncsg indicates that a NCSG is needed if any of the UE configured BWPs do not contain the frequency domain resources of the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Value nogapnoncsg indicates that neither a measurement gap nor a NCSG is needed to measure the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP for all configured BWPs, no matter the SSB is within the configured BWP or not.
