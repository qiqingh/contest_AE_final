Value=6 applies for a UE supporting reduced CP latency for the case of RRCResume message only including MAC and PHY configuration, reestablishPDCP and reestablishRLC for SRB2, multicast \( \mathrm{MRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) and \( \mathrm{DRB}(\mathrm{s}) \), and no DRX, SPS, configured grant, CA or MIMO reconfiguration will be triggered by this message. Further, the UL grant for transmission of RRCResumeComplet \( e \) and the data is transmitted over common search space with DCI format \( 0 \_0 \). In this scenario, the RRC procedure delay [ms] can extend beyond the reception of the UL grant, up to 7 ms . \\
For other cases, Value \( =10 \) applies.
