\hline DownlinkConfigCommonSIB field descriptions \\

The modification period related configuration.

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
frequencyinfoDL-SIB \\
Basic parameters of a downlink carrier and transmission thereon.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
initialDownlinkBWP \\
The initial downlink BWP configuration for a PCell. The network configures the locationAndBandwidth so that the initial downlink BWP contains the entire CORESET\#0 of this serving cell in the frequency domain. The UE applies the locationAndBandwidth upon reception of this field (e.g. to determine the frequency position of signals described in relation to this locationAndBandwidth) but it keeps CORESET\#0 until after reception of RRCSetup/RRCResume/RRCReestablishment.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap \\
If present, RedCap UEs use this DL BWP instead of initialDownilinkWP. If the locationAndBandwidth of this BWP contains the entire CORESET\#0, the UE applies the locationAndBandwidth upon reception of this field (e.g. to determine the frequency position of signals described in relation to this locationAndBandwidth) but it keeps CORESET\#0 until after reception of RRCSetup/RRCResume/RRCReestablishment. Otherwise, i.e., if the locationAndBandwidth of this BWP does not contain the entire CORESET\#0, the UE uses this BWP also for receiving DL messages during initial access (Msg2, Msg4, ...) and after initial access. \\
If absent, RedCap UEs use initialDownilinkBWP provided that it does not exceed the RedCap UE maximum bandwidth (see also clause 5.2.2.4.2).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
lastUsedCellOnly \\
When present, the field indicates that the UE monitors PEI only if its last connection was released by this cell. A PEI-capable UE stores its last used cell information.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO \\
The number of PDCCH monitoring occasions corresponding to an SSB within a Paging Occasion, see TS 38.304 [20], clause 7.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pcch-Config \\
The paging related configuration.
