5.7.13 RLM/BFD relaxation

The UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation according to requirements specified in TS 38.133 [14] when relaxed measurement criterion for low mobility and/or for good serving cell quality is met.
5.7.13.1 Relaxed measurement criterion for low mobility

The relaxed measurement criterion for UE with low mobility in RRC_CONNECTED is fulfilled when:
- (SS-RSRP \( { }_{\text {ReJ }} \) - SS-RSRP) < \( \mathrm{S}_{\text {SearchDeltaP-Connected, }} \)

Where:
- SS-RSRP = current L3 RSRP measurement of the SpCell based on SSB (dB).
- SS-RSRP \( { }_{\text {ReJ }}= \) reference L3 RSRP measurement of the SpCell based on SSB (dB), set as follows:
- After receiving low mobility criterion configuration, or
- After MAC of the CG successfully completes a Random Access procedure after applying a reconfigurationWithSync in spCellConfig of the CG while low mobility criterion is configured, or
- If (SS-RSRP - SS-RSRP \( { }_{\text {Rer }} \) ) \( >0 \), or
- If the relaxed measurement criterion has not been met for \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {SearchDelap-Connected }} \) :
- The UE shall set the value of SS-RSRP \( { }_{\mathrm{Re} 5} \) to the current SS-RSRP value of the SpCell.
5.7.13.2 Relaxed measurement criterion for good serving cell quality

The relaxed measurement criterion of good serving cell quality for RLM starts to be evaluated after receiving the good serving cell quality criterion configuration and is fulfilled when the downlink radio link quality on the configured RLMRS resource is evaluated to be better than the threshold \( \mathrm{Q}_{11}+\mathrm{XdB}_{3} \), wherein
- \( \quad \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{m}} \) is specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.133 [14].
- X is the parameter offset in goodServingCellEvaluationRLM.

The relaxed measurement criterion of good serving cell quality for BFD starts to be evaluated after receiving the good serving cell quality criterion configuration and is fulfilled when the downlink radio link quality on the configured BFDRS resource is evaluated to be better than the threshold \( \mathrm{Q}_{11}+\mathrm{XdB}_{1} \), wherein
- \( \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{in}} \) is specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.133 [14].

X is the parameter offset in goodServingCellEvaluationBFD.
