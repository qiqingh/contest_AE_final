\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline RLF-Report field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
choCandidateCellList \\
This field is used to indicate the list of candidate target cells for conditional handover included in condRRCReconfig at the time of connection failure. The field does not include the candidate target cells included in measResulNeighCells.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
choCellid \\
This field is used to indicate the candidate target cell for conditional handover included in condRRCReconfig that the UE selected for CHO based recovery while T311 is running.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
connectionFailureType \\
This field is used to indicate whether the connection failure is due to radio link failure or handover failure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap, csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap-v1650 \\
These fields are used to indicate the CSI-RS indexes configured in the RLM configurations for the active BWP when the UE declares RLF or HOF. The UE first fills in the csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap-r16 to indicate the first 96 CSI-RS indexes and then csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap-v1650 to indicate the latter 96 CSI-RS indexes. The first/leftmost bit in csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap-r16 corresponds to CSI-RS index 0, the second bit corresponds to CSI-RS index 1. The firstfleftmost bit in csi-rsRLMConfigBitmap-v1650 corresponds to CSI-RS index 96, the second bit corresponds to CSI-RS index 97. These fields are included only if the RadioLinkMonitoringConfig for the respective BWP is configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
c-RNTI \\
This field indicates the C-RNTI used in the PCell upon detecting radio link failure or the C-RNTI used in the source PCell upon handover failure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
failedPCellid \\
This field is used to indicate the PCell in which RLF is detected or the target PCell of the failed handover. For intra-NR handover \( n r F a i l e d P C e l l d \) is included and for the handover from NR to EUTRA eutraFailedPCellld is included. The UE sets the ARFCN according to the frequency band used for transmission/ reception when the failure occurred.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
failedPCellid-EUTRA \\
This field is used to indicate the PCell in which RLF is detected or the source PCell of the failed handover in an E-UTRA RLF report.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
lastHO-Type \\
This field is used to indicate the type of the last executed handover before the last detected connection failure. The field is set to cho if the last executed handover was initiated by a conditional reconfiguration execution. The field is set to daps if the last executed handover was a DAPS handover.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultListEUTRA \\
This field refers to the last measurement results taken in the neighboring EUTRA Cells, when the radio link failure or handover failure happened.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultListNR \\
This field refers to the last measurement results taken in the neighboring NR Cells, when the radio link failure or handover failure happened or successful handover happened. If configuration of the conditional handover is available in VarConditionalReconfig when the radio link failure happened, or if the the last executed RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was concerning a conditional handover when the handover failure or the successful handover happened, the UE uses measResuitListNR-r17, otherwise it uses measResuitListNR-r16.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResultLastServCell \\
This field refers to the log measurement results taken in the PCell upon detecting radio link failure or the source PCell upon handover failure.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
measResult-RLF-Report-EUTRA \\
Includes the E-UTRA RLF-Report-r9 IE as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
noSuitableCellFound \\
This field is set by the UE when the T311 expires.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
previousPCellld \\
This field is used to indicate the source PCell of the last handover (source PCell when the last executed RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was received). For intra-NR handover \( n r P r e v i o u s C e l l \) is included and for the handover from EUTRA to NR eutraPreviousCell is included.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ra-InformationCommon \\
This field is optionally included when connectionFailureType is set to 'hof' or when connectionFailureType is set to 'rlf' and the \( n f \)-Cause equals to 'randomAccessProblem' or 'beamRecoveryFailure'; otherwise this field is absent.
\end{tabular} \\
