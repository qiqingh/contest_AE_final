\( 1> \) if \( g a p F R 1 \) is set to setup:
\( 2> \) if an FR1 measurement gap configuration configured by \( g a p F R I \) is already setup, release the FR1 measurement gap configuration;
\( 2> \) setup the FR1 measurement gap configuration indicated by the gapFRI in accordance with the received gapOffset, i.e., the first subframe of each gap occurs at an SFN and subframe meeting the following condition:

SFN \( \bmod T= \) FLOOR(gapOffset/ 10 );
subframe \( = \) gapOffset \( \bmod 10 \);
with \( T=\mathrm{MGRP} / 10 \) as defined in TS 38.133 [14];
2> apply the specified timing advance \( m g t a \) to the gap occurrences calculated above (i.e the UE starts the measurement mgta ms before the gap subframe occurrences);
\( 2> \) associate the FR1 measurement gap with the measGapld indicated by the GapConfig (if present);
\( 1> \) else if \( g a p F R 1 \) is set to release:
\( 2> \) release the FR1 measurement gap configuration configured by gapFR1;
