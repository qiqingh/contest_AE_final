ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

The network applies the procedure e g as follows:
- When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies the UE context:
- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
- to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
- When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context:
- to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels and Uu Relay RLC channels;
- to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.

If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'other'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for [AB, SRB2, are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.
5.3.7.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG and \( t 316 \) is not configured, in accordance with 5.3 .10 ; or
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG while SCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with 5.3 .10 ; or
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG while PSCell change or PSCell addition is ongoing, in accordance with 5.3.10; or
\( 1> \) upon re-configuration with sync failure of the MCG, in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.3; or
\( 1> \) upon mobility from NR failure, in accordance with clause 5.4 .3 .5 ; or
\( 1> \) upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers concerning SRB1 or SRB2, except if the integrity check failure is detected on the RRCReestablishment message; or
\( 1> \) upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.2; or
\( 1> \) upon detecting radio link failure for the SCG while MCG transmission is suspended, in accordance with clause 5.3.10.3 in NR-DC or in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.3.11.3 in NE-DC; or

1> upon reconfiguration with sync failure of the SCG while MCG transmission is suspended in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.3; or
\( 1> \) upon SCG change failure while MCG transmission is suspended in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.3.5.7a; or
\( 1> \) upon SCG configuration failure while MCG transmission is suspended in accordance with clause 5.3.5.8.2 in NR-DC or in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.3.5.5 in NE-DC; or
\( 1> \) upon integrity check failure indication from SCG lower layers concerning SRB3 while MCG is suspended; or
\( 1> \) upon T316 expiry, in accordance with clause 5.7.3b.5; or
1> upon detecting sidelink radio link failure by L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED, in accordance with clause 5.8.9.3; or
\( 1> \) upon reception of NotificationMessageSidelink including indicationType by L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED, in accordance with clause 5.8.9.10.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T310, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T312, if running;
