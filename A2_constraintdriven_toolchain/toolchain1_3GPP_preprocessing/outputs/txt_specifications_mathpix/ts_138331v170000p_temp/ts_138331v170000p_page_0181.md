\( 2> \) consider a CSI-RS resource to be applicable for deriving cell measurements when the concerned CSI-RS resource is included in the csi-rs-CellMobility including the physCellld of the cell in theCSI-RSResourceConfigMobility in the associated measObject;
\( 2> \) if nrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage in the associated measObject is not configured; or
\( 2> \) if absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation in the associated measObject is not configured; or
\( 2> \) if the highest beam measurement quantity value is below or equal to absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation:
3> derive each cell measurement quantity based on applicable CSI-RS resources for the cell as the highest beam measurement quantity value, where each beam measurement quantity is described in TS 38.215 [9];
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) derive each cell measurement quantity based on CSI-RS as the linear power scale average of the highest beam measurement quantity values above absThreshCSI-RS-Consolidation where the total number of averaged beams shall not exceed nrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage;
\( 2> \) apply layer 3 cell filtering as described in 5.5.3.2.
5.5.3.3a Derivation of layer 3 beam filtered measurement

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each layer 3 beam filtered measurement quantity to be derived based on SS/PBCH block;
\( 2> \) derive each configured beam measurement quantity based on SS/PBCH block as described in TS 38.215[9], and apply layer 3 beam filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;
\( 1> \) for each layer 3 beam filtered measurement quantity to be derived based on CSI-RS;
\( 2> \) derive each configured beam measurement quantity based on CSI-RS as described in TS 38.215 [9], and apply layer 3 beam filtering as described in 5.5.3.2.
5.5.3.4 Derivation of L2 U2N Relay UE measurement results

A UE may be configured by network to derive NR sidelink measurement results of serving L2 Relay UE or candidate L2 U2N Relay UEs associated to the measurement objects configured in the measObjectRelay.

The UE shall:
1> for each L2 U2N Relay UE measurement quantity to be derived:
\( 2> \) derive the corresponding measurement quantity based on DMRS as described in TS 38.215 [9] of the L2 U2N Relay UE associated to the NR sidelink frequency indicated in the concerned measObjectRelay;
\( 2> \) apply layer 3 filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;
5.5.4 Measurement report triggering
5.5.4.1 General

If AS security has been activated successfully, the UE shall:
1> for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
\( 2> \) if the corresponding reportConfig includes a reportType set to eventTriggered or periodical:
\( 3> \) if the corresponding measObject concerns NR:
4> if the corresponding reportConfig includes measRSSI-ReportConfig:
\( 5> \) consider the resource indicated by the rmtc-Config on the associated frequency to be applicable;
