\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline PDCP-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
cipheringDisabled \\
If included, ciphering is disabled for this DRB regardless of which ciphering algorithm is configured for the SRB/DRBs. The field may only be included if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field is absent. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
discardTimer \\
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms 10 corresponds to 10 ms , value ms 20 corresponds to 20 ms and so on. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
discardTimerExt \\
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms Odot 5 corresponds to 0.5 ms , value ms 1 corresponds to 1 ms and so on. If this field is present, the field discard Timer is ignored and discardTimerExt is used instead.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
discardTimerExt2 \\
Value in ms of discard TimerExt2 specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value \( m s 2000 \) corresponds to 2000 ms . If this field is present, the field discardTimer and discard TimerExt are ignored and discardTimerExt2 is used instead.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drb-ContinueROHC \\
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. This field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated. The network does not include the field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer. This field can be configured for both DRB and multicast MRB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
duplicationState \\
This field indicates the uplink PDCP duplication state for the associated RLC entities at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, the PDCP duplication state is activated for the associated RLC entity. The index for the indication is determined by ascending order of logical channel ID of all RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity indicated by primaryPath in the order of MCG and SCG, as in clause 6.1.3.32 of TS 38.321 [3]. If the number of associated RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity is two, UE ignores the value in the largest index of this field. If the field is absent, the PDCP duplication states are deactivated for all associated RLC entities.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
ethernetHeaderCompression \\
This fields configures Ethernet Header Compression. This field can only be configured for a bi-directional DRB or a bi-directional multicast MRB. The network reconfigures ethernetHeaderCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment and with neither drb-ContinueEHC-DL nor drb-ContinueEHC-UL configured. \\
Network only configures this field when uplinkDataCompression is not configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
headerCompression \\
If rohc is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in both uplink and downlink. If uplinkOnlyROHC is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in uplink (there is no header compression in downlink). ROHC can be configured for any bearer type. ROHC and EHC can be both configured simultaneously for a DRB or a multicast MRB. The network reconfigures headerCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment, and without any drbContinueROHC. Network configures headerCompression to notUsed when outOfOrderDelivery is configured. Network only configures this field when uplinkDataCompression is not configured.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
integrityProtection \\
Indicates whether or not integrity protection is configured for this radio bearer. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
maxCID \\
Indicates the value of the MAX_CID parameter as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. \\
The total value of MAX_CIDs across all bearers for the UE should be less than or equal to the value of maxNumberROHC-ContextSessions parameter as indicated by the UE.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
moreThanOneRLC \\
This field configures UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. This field is not present if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
more ThanTwoRLC-DRB \\
This field configures UL data transmission when more than two RLC entities are associated with the PDCP entity for DRBs.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
