MeasObjectRxTxDiff field descriptions
di-Ref
configures the DL references signals to measure Rx-Tx time difference. prs-Ref-r17 indicates PRS is chosen, and csi-RS-Ref-r17 indicates that CSI-RS for tracking is chosen. Only one PRS resource is configured by the network. Only one NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet can be configured with pdc-Info-r17 set to true and it is used for UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement. Only reference signals from the PCell of the MCG can be configured by the network.
