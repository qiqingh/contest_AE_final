3> assemble the warning message from the received warningMessageSegment(s);
3> forward the received warning message, messageldentifier, serialNumber and dataCodingScheme to upper layers;

3> stop reception of SIB7;
\( 3> \) discard the current values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7;
\( 2> \) else:
3> store the received warningMessageSegment;
\( 3> \) continue reception of SIB7;
1> else if all segments of a warning message have been received:
\( 2> \) assemble the warning message from the received warningMessageSegment(s);
\( 2> \) forward the received complete warning message, messageldentifier, serialNumber and dataCodingScheme to upper layers;
\( 2> \) stop reception of SIB7;
\( 2> \) discard the current values of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7;
1> else:
\( 2> \) store the received warningMessageSegment;
\( 2> \) continue reception of SIB7;
The UE should discard any stored warningMessageSegment and the current value of messageldentifier and serialNumber for SIB7 if the complete warning message has not been assembled within a period of 3 hours.
5.2.2.4.9 Actions upon reception of SIB8

Upon receiving the SIB8 the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if the SIB8 contains a complete warning message and the complete geographical area coordinates (if any):
\( 2> \) forward the received warning message, messageldentifier, serialNumber, dataCodingScheme and the geographical area coordinates (if any) to upper layers;
\( 2> \) continue reception of SIB8;
1> else:
\( 2> \) if the received values of messageldentifier and serialNumber are the same (each value is the same) as a pair for which a warning message and the geographical area coordinates (if any) are currently being assembled:

3> store the received warningMessageSegment;
3> store the received warningAreaCoordinatesSegment (if any);
\( 3> \) if all segments of a warning message and geographical area coordinates (if any) have been received:
4> assemble the warning message from the received warningMessageSegment;
\( 4> \) assemble the geographical area coordinates from the received warningAreaCoordinatesSegment (if any);

4> forward the received warning message, messageldentifier, serialNumber, dataCodingScheme and geographical area coordinates (if any) to upper layers;

4> stop assembling a warning message and geographical area coordinates (if any) for this messageldentifier and serialNumber and delete all stored information held for it;
