5.3.5.6.7 Multicast MRB addition/modification

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) for each \( m r b \)-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList for which mrb-IdentityNew is included (multicast MRB ID change):
\( 2> \) update the mrb-Identity to the value mrb-IdentityNew;
\( 1> \) for each \( m r b \)-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (multicast MRB establishment including the case when full configuration option is used):
\( 2> \) establish a PDCP entity and configure it in accordance with the received pdcp-Config;
\( 2> \) if the multicast MRB was configured with the same tmgi prior to receiving this reconfiguration message:
\( 3> \) associate the established multicast MRB with the corresponding \( t m g i \);
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) indicate the establishment of the multicast \( \operatorname{MRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) and the \( t m g i \) of the established multicast \( \operatorname{MRB}(\mathrm{s}) \) to upper layers;
\( 2> \) if an SDAP entity with the received tmgi does not exist:
3> establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1;
\( 1> \) for each \( m r b \)-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList that is part of the current UE configuration (prior treating this mrb-ToAddModList):
\( 2> \) if the reestablishPDCP is set:
3> if drb-ContinueROHC is included in pdcp-Config:
\( 4> \) indicate to lower layer that \( d r b \)-ContinueROHC is configured;
3> if drb-ContinueEHC-DL is included in pdcp-Config:
4> indicate to lower layer that \( d r b \)-ContinueEHC-DL is configured;
3> re-establish the PDCP entity of this multicast MRB as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.1.2;
\( 2> \) else, if the recoverPDCP is set:
3> trigger the PDCP entity of this MRB to perform data recovery as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) if the pdcp-Config is included:
3> reconfigure the PDCP entity in accordance with the received pdcp-Config.
NOTE 1: When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by releasing the old RLC entity.

NOTE 2: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
5.3.5.7 AS Security key update

The UE shall:
1> if UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC:
\( 2> \) upon reception of \( s k \)-Counter as specified in TS 36.331 [10]:
3> update the \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) key based on the \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} \) key and using the received \( s k \)-Counter value, as specified in TS 33.401 [30] for EN-DC, or TS 33.501 [11] for NGEN-DC;
