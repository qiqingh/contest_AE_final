2> set the measResultFreqListEUTRA to include the best measured cells, ordered such that the best cell is listed first using RSRP to order the cells if RSRP measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using RSRQ to order the cells if RSRQ measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using SINR to order the cells, based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and for each cell that is included, include the optional fields that are available;

1> for each UTRA-FDD frequency the UE is configured to measure by measConfig for which measurement results are available:
\( 2> \) set the measResultFreqListUTRA-FDD to include the best measured cells, ordered such that the best cell is listed first using RSCP to order the cells if RSCP measurement results are available for cells on this frequency, otherwise using EcN0 to order the cells, based on measurements collected up to the moment the UE detected the failure, and for each cell that is included, include the optional fields that are available;

1> if the UE is in NR-DC:
\( 2> \) include and set measResultSCG in accordance with 5.7.3.4;
1> if the UE is in NE-DC:
\( 2> \) include and set measResultSCG-EUTRA in accordance with TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.6.13.5;
NOTE 1: The measured quantities are filtered by the L3 filter as configured in the mobility measurement configuration. The measurements are based on the time domain measurement resource restriction, if configured. Exclude-listed cells are not required to be reported.

NOTE 2: Field measResultSCG-Failure is used to report available results for NR frequencies the UE is configured to measure by SCG RRC signalling.

NOTE 3: Field measResultSCG-EUTRA is used to report available results for E-UTRAN frequencies the UE is configured to measure by E-UTRA RRC signalling.
\( 1> \) if SRB1 is configured as split SRB and pdcp-Duplication is not configured:
\( 2> \) if the primaryPath for the PDCP entity of SRB1 refers to the MCG:
\( 3> \) set the primaryPath to refer to the SCG.
The UE shall:
\( 1> \) start timer T316;
\( 1> \) if SRB1 is configured as split SRB:
2> submit the MCGFailureInformation message to lower layers for transmission via SRB1, upon which the procedure ends;
\( 1> \) else (i.e. SRB3 configured):
\( 2> \) submit the MCGFailureInformation message to lower layers for transmission embedded in NR RRC message ULInformationTransferMRDC via SRB3 as specified in 5.7.2a.3.
5.7.3b.5 T316 expiry

The UE shall:
1> if T316 expires:
\( 2> \) initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7.
