\( 3> \) else (i.e., UE connected to NR or UE in EN-DC):
\( 4> \) configure the PDCP entity to apply the integrity protection algorithm and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { int }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eNB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) or secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ), as indicated in keyToUse, i.e. the integrity protection configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful completion of the procedure;
\( 4> \) configure the PDCP entity to apply the ciphering algorithm and \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{RRC} \text { enc }} \) key associated with the master key ( \( \mathrm{K}_{\varepsilon \mathrm{NB}} / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) or secondary key ( \( \mathrm{S}-\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \) ) as indicated in keyToUse, i.e. the ciphering configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful completion of the procedure;

3> re-establish the PDCP entity of this SRB as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) else, if the discardOnPDCP is set:
3> trigger the PDCP entity to perform SDU discard as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
\( 2> \) if the pdcp-Config is included:
\( 3> \) reconfigure the PDCP entity in accordance with the received pdcp-Config.
5.3.5.6.4 DRB release

The UE shall:
1> for each \( d r b \)-Identity value included in the \( d r b \)-ToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration; or
\( 1> \) for each \( d r b \)-Identity value that is to be released as the result of full configuration according to 5.3.5.11:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity and the drb-Identity;
\( 2> \) if SDAP entity associated with this DRB is configured:
\( 3> \) indicate the release of the DRB to SDAP entity associated with this DRB (TS 37.324 [24], clause 5.3.3);
\( 2> \) if the DRB is associated with an eps-BearerIdentity:
3> if a new bearer is not added either with NR or E-UTRA with same eps-BearerIdentity:
4> indicate the release of the DRB and the eps-BearerIdentity of the released DRB to upper layers.
NOTE 1: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the \( d r b \)-ToReleaseList includes any drb-Identity value that is not part of the current UE configuration.

NOTE 2: Whether or not the RLC and MAC entities associated with this PDCP entity are reset or released is determined by the CellGroupConfig.
5.3.5.6.5 DRB addition/modification

The UE shall:
1> for each \( d r b \)-Identity value included in the \( d r b \)-ToAddModList that is not part of the current UE configuration (DRB establishment including the case when full configuration option is used):
\( 2> \) establish a PDCP entity and configure it in accordance with the received pdcp-Config;
\( 2> \) if the PDCP entity of this DRB is not configured with cipheringDisabled:
3> if target RAT of handover is E-UTRA/5GC; or
3> if the UE is connected to E-UTRA/5GC:
4> if the UE is capable of E-UTRA/5GC but not capable of NGEN-DC:
