ETSI TS 138331 V17.0.0 (2022-05)

\( 6> \) include the beam measurement results as indicated by reportQuantityRS-Indexes;
NOTE 1: How the UE performs idle/inactive measurements is up to UE implementation as long as the requirements in TS 38.133 [14] are met for measurement reporting.

NOTE 2: The UE is not required to perform idle/inactive measurements on a given carrier if the SSB configuration of that carrier provided via dedicated signaling is different from the SSB configuration broadcasted in the serving cell, if any.

NOTE 3: How the UE prioritizes which frequencies to measure or report (in case it is configured with more frequencies than it can measure or report) is left to UE implementation.
5.7.8.3 T331 expiry or stop

The UE shall:
1> if T331 expires or is stopped:
\( 2> \) release the VarMeasIdleConfig-
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation whether to continue idle/inactive measurements according to SIB11 and SIB4 configurations or according to E-UTRA SIB5 and E-UTRA SIB24 configurations as specified in TS 36.331 [10] upon inter-RAT cell reselection to E-UTRA, after T331 has expired or stopped.
5.7.8.4 Cell re-selection or cell selection while T331 is running

The UE shall:
1> if intra-RAT cell selection or reselection occurs while T331 is running:
\( 2> \) if validityAreaList is configured in VarMeasIdleConfig:
\( 3> \) if the serving frequency does not match with the carrierFreq of an entry in the validityAreaList; or
3> if the serving frequency matches with the carrierFreq of an entry in the validityAreaList, the validityCellList is included in that entry, and the physical cell identity of the serving cell does not match with any entry in validityCellList:
\( 4> \) stop timer T331;
\( 4> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3, upon which the procedure ends.
1> else if inter-RAT cell selection or reselection occurs while T331 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T331;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3;
5.7.9 Mobility history information
5.7.9.1 General

This procedure specifies how the mobility history information is stored by the UE, covering RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED.
5.7.9.2 Initiation

If the UE supports storage of mobility history information, the UE shall:
1> Upon addition of a PSCell:
\( 2> \) include an entry in visitedPSCellInfoList in variable VarMobilityHistoryReport possibly after removing the oldest entry, if necessary, according to following:
