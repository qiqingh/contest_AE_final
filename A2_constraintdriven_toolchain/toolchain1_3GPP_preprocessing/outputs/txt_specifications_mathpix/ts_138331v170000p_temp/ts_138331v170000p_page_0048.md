\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the DedicatedSIBRequest message in accordance with 5.2.2.3.6;
4> start timer T350 with the timer value set to the onDemandSIB-RequestProhibitTimer;
\( 4> \) acquire the requested SI message(s) corresponding to the requested SIB(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2.
\( 2> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the posSI-SchedulingInfo in the stored SIB1, contain at least one requested posSIB and for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to broadcasting:
\( 3> \) acquire the SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2;
\( 2> \) for the SI message(s) that, according to the posSI-SchedulingInfo in the stored SIB1, contain at least one requested posSIB and for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting:

3> if onDemandSIB-Request is configured and timer T350 is not running:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the DedicatedSIBRequest message in accordance with 5.2.2.3.6;
4> start timer T350 with the timer value set to the onDemandSIB-RequestProhibitTimer;
4> acquire the requested SI message(s) corresponding to the requested posSIB(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2.

NOTE: UE may include on demand request for SIB and/or posSIB(s) in the same DedicatedSIBRequest message.
5.2.2.3.6 Actions related to transmission of DedicatedSIBRequest message

The UE shall set the contents of DedicatedSIBRequest message as follows:
\( 1> \) if the procedure is triggered to request the required \( \operatorname{SIB}(s) \) :
\( 2> \) include requestedSIB-List in the onDemandSIB-RequestList to indicate the requested SIB(s);
\( 1> \) if the procedure is triggered to request the required \( \operatorname{pos} S I B(s) \) :
\( 2> \) include requestedPosSIB-List in the onDemandSIB-RequestList to indicate the requested posSIB(s).
The UE shall submit the DedicatedSIBRequest message to lower layers for transmission.
5.2.2.4 Actions upon receipt of System Information
5.2.2.4.1 Actions upon reception of the \( M I B \)

Upon receiving the \( M I B \) the UE shall:
1> store the acquired MIB;
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE, or if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
\( 2> \) if the cellBarred in the acquired MIB is set to barred:
3> if the UE is a RedCap UE:
\( 4> \) if ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13])
\( 5> \) acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];3>consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 [20];

3> perform cell re-selection to other cells on the same frequency as the barred cell as specified in TS 38.304 [20];
\( 2> \) else:
