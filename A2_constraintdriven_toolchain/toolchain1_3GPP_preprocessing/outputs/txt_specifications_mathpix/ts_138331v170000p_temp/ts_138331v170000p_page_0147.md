\( 2> \) for each radio bearer that is configured for SDT:
3> restore the configuration associated with the RLC bearers of masterCellGroup and pdcp-Config from the UE Inactive AS context;

3> re-establish PDCP entity for the radio bearer without triggering PDCP status report;
\( 2> \) resume all the radio bearers that are configured for SDT;
\( 1> \) submit the selected message RRCResumeRequest or RRCResumeRequest I for transmission to lower layers
NOTE 2: Only DRBs with previously configured UP ciphering shall resume ciphering.
If lower layers indicate an integrity check failure while T319 or T319a is running, perform actions specified in 5.3.13.5.
The UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection are fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in 5.3.13.6.
5.3.13.4 Reception of the RRCResume by the UE

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T319, if running;
1> stop timer T319a, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T380, if running;
1> if T331 is running:
\( 2> \) stop timer T331;
\( 2> \) perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3;
\( 1> \) if the RRCResume includes the fullConfig:
\( 2> \) perform the full configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.5.11;
1> else:
\( 2> \) if the RRCResume does not include the restoreMCG-SCells:
3> release the MCG SCell(s) from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 2> \) if the RRCResume does not include the restoreSCG:
\( 3> \) release the MR-DC related configurations (i.e., as specified in 5.3.5.10) from the UE Inactive AS context, if stored;
\( 2> \) restore the masterCellGroup, mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup, if stored, and pdcp-Config from the UE Inactive AS context;
\( 2> \) configure lower layers to consider the restored MCG and SCG SCell(s) (if any) to be in deactivated state;
\( 1> \) discard the UE Inactive AS context;
\( 1> \) store the used nextHopChainingCount value associated to the current \( \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{gNB}} \);
1> release the suspendConfig except the ran-NotificationArealnfo;
\( 1> \) if the RRCResume includes the masterCellGroup:
\( 2> \) perform the cell group configuration for the received masterCellGroup according to 5.3.5.5;
\( 1> \) if the RRCResume includes the mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup:
\( 2> \) if the received \( m r d c \)-SecondaryCellGroup is set to \( n r \)-SCG:
