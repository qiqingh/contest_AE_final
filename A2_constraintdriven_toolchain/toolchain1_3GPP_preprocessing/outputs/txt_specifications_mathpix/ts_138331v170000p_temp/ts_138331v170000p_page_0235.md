\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference on the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling of a cell group for power saving:
\( 2> \) if the UE has a preference on the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling of the cell group and the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with minSchedulingOffsetPreference and/or minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt for the cell group since it was configured to provide its preference on the minimum scheduling offset for cross-slot scheduling of the cell group for power saving; or
\( 2> \) if the current minSchedulingOffsetPreference and/or minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt information for the cell group is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message including minSchedulingOffsetPreference and/or minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt for the cell group and timer T346e associated with the cell group is not running:
\( 3> \) start the timer T346e with the timer value set to the minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceProhibitTimer of the cell group;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide the current minSchedulingOffsetPreference and/or minSchedulingOffsetPreferenceExt;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its release preference and timer T346f is not running:
\( 2> \) if the UE determines that it would prefer to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED state; or
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured with connectedReporting and the UE determines that it would prefer to revert an earlier indication to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED state:
\( 3> \) start timer T346f with the timer value set to the releasePreferenceProhibitTimer;
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide the release preference;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication:
\( 2> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7 4.3 to provide configured grant assistance information for NR sidelink communication;
\( 1> \) if configured to provide preference in being provisioned with reference time information:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistancelnformation message with referenceTimeInfoPreference since it was configured to provide preference; or
\( 2> \) if the UE's preference changed from the last time UE initiated transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message including referenceTimeInfoPreference:
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide preference in being provisioned with reference time information.
\( 1> \) if configured to provide its preference on FR2 UL gap:
\( 2> \) if the UE did not transmit a UEAssistanceInformation message with \( u \) /-GapFR2-Preference since it was configured to provide its preference on FR2 UL gap information:
\( 3> \) if the UE has a preference on FR2 UL gap activation/deactivation:
\( 4> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide FR2 UL gap preference;
\( 2> \) else if the current FR2 UL gap preference is different from the one indicated in the last transmission of the UEAssistancelnformation message:
\( 3> \) initiate transmission of the UEAssistanceInformation message in accordance with 5.7 .4 .3 to provide FR2 UL gap preference.

1> if configured to provide MUSIM assistance information for leaving RRC_CONNECTED:
\( 2> \) if the UE needs to leave RRC_CONNECTED state and the timer T346g is not running:
