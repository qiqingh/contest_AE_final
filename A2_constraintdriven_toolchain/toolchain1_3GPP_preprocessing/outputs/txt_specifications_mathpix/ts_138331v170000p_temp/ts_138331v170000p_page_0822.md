\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SPS-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-CodebookID \\
Indicates the HARQ-ACK codebook index for the corresponding HARQ-ACK codebook for SPS PDSCH and ACK for SPS PDSCH release.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-ProcID-Offset \\
Indicates the offset used in deriving the HARQ process IDs, see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.3.1.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mcs-Table \\
Indicates the MCS table the UE shall use for DL SPS (see TS 38.214 [19],clause 5.1.3.1. If present, the UE shall use the MCS table of low-SE 64QAM table indicated in Table 5.1.3.1-3 of TS 38.214 [19]. If this field is absent and field mcs-table in PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam256' and the activating DCI is of format 1_1, the UE applies the 256QAM table indicated in Table 5.1.3.1-2 of TS 38.214 [19]. If this field is absent and the field mcs-Table-r17 in PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam 1024' and the activating DCI is format 1_1, the UE applies the 1024QAM table indicated in Table 5.1.3.1-4 of TS 38.214 [19]. Otherwise, the UE applies the non-low-SE 64QAM table indicated in Table 5.1.3.1-1 of TS 38.214 [19].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
n1PUCCH-AN \\
HARQ resource for PUCCH for DL SPS. The network configures the resource either as format0 or format1. The actual PUCCH-Resource is configured in PUCCH-Config and referred to by its ID. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
n1PUCCH-AN-PUCCHsSCell \\
HARQ resource for PUCCH on PUCCH switching SCell (sSCell) for DL SPS. The network configures the resource either as format 0 or format 1. The actual PUCCH-Resource is configured in PUCCH-Config of the PUCCH sSCell and referred to by its ID. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nrofHARQ-Processes, nrofHARQ-ProcessesExt \\
Number of configured HARQ processes for SPS DL (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.1). If UE is configured with nrofHARQ-ProcessesExt UE shall ignore nrofHARQ-Processes.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-AggregationFactor \\
Number of repetitions for SPS PDSCH (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.1). When the field is absent, the UE applies PDSCH aggregation factor of PDSCH-Config.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicity \\
Periodicity for DL SPS (see TS 38.214 [19] and TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.1).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
periodicityExt \\
This field is used to calculate the periodicity for DL SPS (see TS 38.214 [19] and see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5,8.1). If this field is present, the field periodicity is ignored. \\
The following periodicities are supported depending on the configured subcarrier spacing [ms]:
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\( 15 \mathrm{kHz}: \) & periodicityExt, where periodicityExt has a value between 1 and 640 \\
\( 30 \mathrm{kHz}: \) & \( 0.5 \times \) periodicity Ext, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 1280. \\
60 kHz with normal CP. & \( 0.25 \times \) periodicityExt, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 2560. \\
60 kHz with ECP: & \( 0.25 \times \) periodicityExt, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 2560. \\
\( 120 \mathrm{kHz}: \) & \( 0.125 \times \) periodicity Ext, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 5120. \\
\( 480 \mathrm{kHz}: \) & \( 0.0625 \times \) periodicity Ext, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 20480. \\
\( 960 \mathrm{kHz}: \) & \( 0.03125 \times \) periodicity Ext, where periodicity Ext has a value between 1 and 40960.
\end{tabular}

\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-Configindex \\
Indicates the index of one of multiple SPS configurations.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sps-HARQ-Deferral \\
Indicates the maximum number of slots or subslots the transmission of DL SPS HARQ-ACK in a slot or subslot can be deferred (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.5.4).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline

- SPS-ConfigIndex

The IE SPS-ConfigIndex is used to indicate the index of one of multiple DL SPS configurations in one BWP.
