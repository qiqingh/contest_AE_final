\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-PSFCH-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-MinTimeGapPSFCH \\
The minimum time gap between PSFCH and the associated PSSCH in the unit of slots.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-NumMuxCS-Pair \\
Indicates the number of cyclic shift pairs used for a PSFCH transmission that can be multiplexed in a PRB.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PSFCH-CandidateResourceType \\
Indicates the number of PSFCH resources available for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information in a PSFCH transmission (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 16.3).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sl-PSFCH-HopID \\
Scrambling ID for sequence hopping of the PSFCH used in the resource pool.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PSFCH-Period \\
Indicates the period of PSFCH resource in the unit of slots within this resource pool. If set to sil, no resource for PSFCH, and HARQ feedback for all transmissions in the resource pool is disabled.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PSFCH-RB-Set \\
Indicates the set of PRBs that are actually used for PSFCH transmission and reception. The leftmost bit of the bitmap refers to the lowest RB index in the resource pool, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding PRB is not used for PSFCH transmission and reception while value 1 indicates that the corresponding PRB is used for PSFCH transmission and reception (see TS 38.213 [13]).
\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline SL-PTRS-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PTRS-FreqDensity \\
Presence and frequency density of SL PT-RS as a function of scheduled BW. If the field is not configured, the UE uses K_PT-RS \( =2 \)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
sI-PTRS-TimeDensity \\
Presence and time density of SLPT-RS as a function of MCS. If the field is not configured, the UE uses L_PT-RS \( =1 \)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
si-PTRS-RE-Offset \\
Indicates the subcarrier offset for SL PT-RS. If the field is not configured, the UE applies the value offset 00
\end{tabular} \\
