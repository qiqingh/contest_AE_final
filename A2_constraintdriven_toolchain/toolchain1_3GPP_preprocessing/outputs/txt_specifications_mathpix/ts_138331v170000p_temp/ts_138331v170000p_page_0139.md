\( 2> \) if an RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfiguration WithSync was received before the connection failure:
\( 3> \) if the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync concerned an intra NR handover:
\( 4> \) include the nrPreviousCell in previousPCellld and set it to the global cell identity and the tracking area code of the PCell where the last executed RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was received;

4 if the last executed RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was concerning a DAPS handover:
\( 5> \) set lastHO-Type to daps;
\( 4> \) else if the last executed RRCReconfiguration message including reconfigurationWithSync was concerning a conditional handover:
\( 5> \) set lastHO-Type to cho;
\( 4> \) set the timeConnFailure to the elapsed time since the execution of the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfiguration WithSync;
\( 3> \) else if the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfigurationWithSync concerned a handover to NR from E-UTRA and if the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:
\( 4> \) include the eutraPreviousCell in previousPCellld and set it to the global cell identity and the tracking area code of the E-UTRA PCell where the last RRCReconfiguration message including reconfiguration WithSync was received embedded in E-UTRA RRC message MobilityFromEUTRACommand message as specified in TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.4.3.3;
\( 4> \) set the timeConnFailure to the elapsed time since reception of the last RRCReconfiguration message including the reconfiguration WithSync embedded in E-UTRA RRC message MobilityFromEUTRACommand message as specified in TS 36.331 [10] clause 5.4.3.3;
\( 3> \) if configuration of the conditional handover is available in VarConditionalReconfig at the moment of radio link failure:
\( 3> \) set choCandidateCellList to include the global cell identity and tracking area code of all the candidate target cells for conditional handover included in condRRCReconfig within VarConditionalReconfig at the time of radio link failure, excluding the candidate target cells included in measResu/NeighCells;
\( 2> \) if configuration of the conditional handover is available in VarConditionalReconfig at the moment of declaring the radio link failure:
\( 3> \) set timeSinceCHO-Reconfig to the time elapsed between the detection of the radio link failure, and the reception, in the source PCell, of the last conditionalReconfiguration including the condRRCReconfig message;
\( 1> \) if connectionFailureType is rlf and the rlf-Cause is set to randomAccessProblem or beamFailureRecoveryFailure; or
\( 1> \) if connectionFailureType is hof and if the failed handover is an intra-RAT handover:
\( 2> \) set the ra-Information Common to include the random-access related information as described in clause 5.7.10.5;
\( 1> \) if available, set the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7.
The UE may discard the radio link failure information or handover failure information, i.e. release the UE variable VarRLF-Report, 48 hours after the radio link failure/handover failure is detected.

NOTE 2: In this clause, the term 'handover failure' has been used to refer to 'reconfiguration with sync failure'.
