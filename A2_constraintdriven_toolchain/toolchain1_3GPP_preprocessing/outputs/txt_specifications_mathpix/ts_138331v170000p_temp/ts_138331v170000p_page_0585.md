\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline tag-Config \\
The field is used to configure parameters for a time-alignment group. The field is not present if any DAPS bearer is configured. \\
\hline usePreBSR \\
If set to true, the MAC entity of the IAB-MT may use the Pre-emptive BSR, see TS 38.321 [3]. \\

\hline Group-Config field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
drx-ConfigPTM \\
Used to configure DRX for PTM transmission as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
groupCommon-RNTI \\
Used to scramble the scheduling and transmission of PTM.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-FeedbackEnablerMulticast \\
Indicates whether the UE shall provide HARQ feedback for MBS multicast. Value dci-enabler means that whether the UE shall provide HARQ feedback for MBS multicast is indicated by DCI. Value enabled means the UE shall always provide HARQ feedback for MBS multicast. When the field is absent, the UE shall not provide HARQ feedback for multicast.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
harq-FeedbackOptionMulticast \\
Indicates the feedback mode for MBS multicast dynamically scheduled PDSCH.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
pdsch-AggregationFactorMulticast \\
Number of repetitions for dynamically scheduled MBS multicast data (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.1).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline DRX & This field is optionally present, Need M, if drx-Config is included and set to 'setup'. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline G-RNTI & This field is optionally present when groupCommon-RNTI is g-RNTI. When the field is absent for g-RNTI, the UE applies the value 1. The field is absent when groupCommon-RNTI is g-CS-RNTI. \\
\hline HARQFeedback & The field is mandatory present when harq-FeedbackEnablerMulticast is present. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline MCG-Only & This field is optionally present, Need M, for the MAC-CellGroupConfig of the MCG. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline LCH-PrioWithReTxTimer & This field is optionally present, Need R, if Ich-BasedPrioritization-r16 is configured in this MAC entity and cg-RetransmissionTimer-r16 is configured for any configured grant configuration associated with this MAC entity. It is absent otherwise. \\
\hline Mode 1AndDRX-Only & This field is optionally present, Need M, if sl-ScheduledConfig is configured and drx-Config is configured. It is absent otherwise. \\

- MeasConfig

The IE MeasConfig specifies measurements to be performed by the UE, and covers intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT mobility as well as configuration of measurement gaps.
