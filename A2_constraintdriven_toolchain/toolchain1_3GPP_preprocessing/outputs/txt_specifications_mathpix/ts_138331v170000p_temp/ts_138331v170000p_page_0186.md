\( 3> \) set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld to 0;
\( 3> \) if the corresponding reportConfig includes measRSSI-ReportConfig:
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure as specified in 5.5 .5 immediately when RSSI sample values are reported by the physical layer after the first L1 measurement duration;
\( 3> \) else if the corresponding reportConfig includes the ul-DelayValueConfig:
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after a first measurement result is provided from lower layers of the associated DRB identity;
\( 3> \) else if the corresponding reportConfig includes the \( u \) /-ExcessDelayConfig:
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after a first measurement result is provided from lower layers of the associated DRB identity(ies) according to the configured threshold per DRB identity(ies);
\( 3> \) else if the reportAmount exceeds 1 :
4 - initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the NR SpCell or for the serving L2 U2N Relay UE (if the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE);
\( 3> \) else (i.e. the reportAmount is equal to 1 ):
\( 4> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the NR SpCell and for the strongest cell among the applicable cells, or for the NR SpCell and for the strongest L2 U2N Relay UEs among the applicable L2 U2N Relay UEs; or initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the serving L2 U2N Relay UE and for the strongest cell among the applicable cells (if the UE is a L2 U2N Remote UE);
\( 2> \) if, in case the corresponding reportConfig concerns the reporting for NR sidelink communication, reportType is set to periodical and if a (first) measurement result is available:
\( 3> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measld;
\( 3> \) set the numberOfReportsSent defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measld to 0;
\( 3> \) initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5 .5 , immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for the NR SpCell and CBR measurement results become available;
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to cli-EventTriggered and if the entry condition applicable for this event, i.e the event corresponding with the eventld of the corresponding reportConfig within VarMeasConfig, is fulfilled for one or more applicable CLI measurement resources for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarMeasConfig, while the VarMeasReportList does not include a measurement reporting entry for this measld (a first CLI measurement resource triggers the event):
\( 3> \) include a measurement reporting entry within the VarMeasReportList for this measld;

\( 2> \) else if the reportType is set to cli-EventTriggered and if the entry condition applicable for this event, i.e the event corresponding with the eventld of the corresponding reportConfig within VarMeasConfig, is fulfilled for one or more CLI measurement resources not included in the cli-TriggeredList for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during timeToTrigger defined for this event within the VarMeasConfig (a subsequent CLI measurement resource triggers the event):
