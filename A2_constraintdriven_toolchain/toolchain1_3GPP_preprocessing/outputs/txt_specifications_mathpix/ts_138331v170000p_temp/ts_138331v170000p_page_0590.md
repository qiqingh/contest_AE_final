\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline MeasGapConfig field descriptions \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
gapAssociationPRS \\
Indicates that PRS measurement is associated with this measurement gap. The network only includes this field for one per UE gap.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
mgta \\
Value \( m g t a \) is the measurement gap timing advance in ms. The applicability of the measurement gap timing advance is according to clause 9.1 .2 of TS 38.133 [14]. Value \( m s 0 \) corresponds to \( 0 \mathrm{~ms}, \mathrm{msOdot} 25 \) corresponds to 0.25 ms and msOdot 5 corresponds to 0.5 ms . For FR2, the network only configures 0 ms and 0.25 ms . If mgta -r 17 is present, UE shall ignore the mgta (without suffix).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
nscgind \\
Indicates that the measurement gap is a NCSG as specified in 38.133 [14].
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
preConfigind \\
Indicates whether the measurement gap is a pre-configured measurement gap.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
refFR2ServCellAsyncCA \\
Indicates the FR2 serving cell identifier whose SFN and subframe is used for FR2 gap calculation for this gap pattern with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s).
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
refServCellindicator \\
Indicates the serving cell whose SFN and subframe are used for gap calculation for this gap pattern. Value pCell corresponds to the PCell, pSCell corresponds to the PSCell, and mcg-FR2 corresponds to a serving cell on FR2 frequency in MCG.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Conditional Presence & Explanation \\
\hline AsyncCA & \begin{tabular}{l}
This field is mandatory present when configuring FR2 gap pattern to UE in: \\
- (NG)EN-DC or NR SA with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s); \\
- NE-DC or NR-DC with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s), if the field refServCellindicator is set to mcg-FR2. In case the gap pattern to UE in NE-DC and NR-DC is already configured and the serving cell used for the gap calculation corresponds to a serving cell on FR2 frequency in MCG, then the field is optionally present, need M. Otherwise, it is absent, Need R.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Gap/D & \begin{tabular}{l}
This field is mandatory present when: \\
- more than one per UE gap is configured; or \\
- more than one FR1 gap is configured; or \\
- more than one FR2 gap is configured; or \\
- per UE gap is configured together with per FR gap. \\
It is optional present, Need R, when: \\
- one or more gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap. \\
Otherwise, this field is not present, Need R. \\
Editor Note: It is FFS whether and how to specify the conditional presence for gap ID
\end{tabular} \\
\hline NEDCorNRDC & This field is mandatory present when configuring gap pattern to UE in NE-DC or NR-DC. In case the gap pattern to UE in NE-DC and NR-DC is already configured, then the field is absent, need M. Otherwise, it is absent. \\
\hline PRS & This field is optionally present, Need R, when configuring gap pattern to UE for measurements of DL-PRS configured via LPP (TS 37.355 [49]). Otherwise, it is absent. \\
\hline
