\( 1> \) for unicast, if the sidelink DRB release was triggered after the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, after receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the sidelink DRB release was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR or indicated by upper layers:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity for NR sidelink communication associated with the sidelink DRB;
\( 2> \) if SDAP entity for NR sidelink communication associated with this sidelink DRB is configured:
\( 3> \) indicate the release of the sidelink DRB to the SDAP entity associated with this sidelink DRB (TS 37.324 [24], clause 5.3.3);
\( 2> \) release SDAP entities for NR sidelink communication, if any, that have no associated sidelink DRB as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.2;
\( 1> \) for groupcast and broadcast; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, after receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the sidelink DRB release was triggered due to the configuration received within the sl-ConfigDedicatedNR:
\( 2> \) for each \( s / \)-RLC-BearerConfigIndex included in the received \( s / \)-RLC-BearerToReleaseList that is part of the current UE sidelink configuration:
\( 3> \) release the RLC entity and the corresponding logical channel for NR sidelink communication, associated with the \( s /-R L C- \) BearerConfigIndex.
\( 1> \) for unicast, if the sidelink DRB release was triggered due to the reception of the RRCReconfigurationSidelink message; or
\( 1> \) for unicast, after receiving the RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink message, if the sidelink DRB release was triggered due to the configuration received within the SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR or indicated by upper layers:
\( 2> \) release the RLC entity and the corresponding logical channel for NR sidelink communication associated with the sidelink DRB ;
\( 2> \) perform the sidelink UE information procedure in clause 5.8 .3 for unicast if needed.
\( 1> \) if the sidelink radio link failure is detected for a specific destination:
\( 2> \) release the PDCP entity, RLC entity and the logical channel of the sidelink DRB for the specific destination.
5.8.9.1a.2 Sidelink DRB addition/modification
5.8.9.1a.2.1 Sidelink DRB addition/modification conditions

For NR sidelink communication, a sidelink DRB addition is initiated only in the following cases:
\( 1> \) if any sidelink QoS flow is (re)configured by sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR and is to be mapped to one sidelink DRB, which is not established; or
\( 1> \) if any sidelink QoS flow is (re)configured by RRCReconfigurationSidelink and is to be mapped to a sidelink DRB, which is not established;

For NR sidelink communication, a sidelink DRB modification is initiated only in the following cases:
\( 1> \) if any of the sidelink DRB related parameters is changed by sl-ConfigDedicatedNR, SIB12, SidelinkPreconfigNR or RRCReconfigurationSidelink for one sidelink DRB, which is established;
5.8.9.1a.2.2 Sidelink DRB addition/modification operations

For the sidelink DRB , whose sidelink DRB addition conditions are met as in clause 5.8.9.1a.2.1, the UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication shall:
