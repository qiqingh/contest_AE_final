5.5a.1.4 T330 expiry

Upon expiry of T330 the UE shall:
1> release VarLogMeasConfig;
The UE is allowed to discard stored logged measurements, i.e. to release VarLogMeasReport, 48 hours after T330 expiry.
5.5a.2 Release of Logged Measurement Configuration
5.5a.2.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to release the logged measurement configuration as well as the logged measurement information.
5.5a.2.2 Initiation

The UE shall initiate the procedure upon receiving a logged measurement configuration in another RAT. The UE shall also initiate the procedure upon power off or upon deregistration.

The UE shall:
\( 1> \) stop timer T330, if running;
\( 1> \) if stored, discard the logged measurement configuration as well as the logged measurement information, i.e. release the UE variables VarLogMeasConfig and VarLogMeasReport.
5.5a.3 Measurements logging
5.5a.3.1 General

This procedure specifies the logging of available measurements by a UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE that has a logged measurement configuration. The actual process of logging within the UE, takes place in RRC IDLE state could continue in RRC INACT IVE state or vice versa.
5.5a.3.2 Initiation

While T330 is running and T319a is not running, the UE shall:
\( 1> \) if measurement logging is suspended:
\( 2> \) if during the last logging interval the IDC problems detected by the UE is resolved, resume measurement logging;

1> if not suspended, perform the logging in accordance with the following:
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to periodical in the VarLogMeasConfig:
\( 3> \) if the UE is in any cell selection state (as specified in TS 38.304 [20]):
4> perform the logging at regular time intervals, as defined by the loggingInterval in the VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 3> \) if the UE is in camped normally state on an NR cell and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport:

4> if areaConfiguration is not included in VarLogMeasConfig; or
\( 4> \) if the serving cell is part of the area indicated by areaConfig in areaConfiguration in VarLogMeasConfig:
