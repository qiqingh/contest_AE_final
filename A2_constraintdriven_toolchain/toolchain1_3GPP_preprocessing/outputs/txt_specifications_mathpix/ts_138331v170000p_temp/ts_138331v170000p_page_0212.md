\( 5> \) perform the logging at regular time intervals, as defined by the logging Interval in the VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 2> \) else if the reportType is set to eventTriggered, and eventType is set to outOfCoverage:
3> perform the logging at regular time intervals as defined by the loggingInterval in VarLogMeasConfig only when the UE is in any cell selection state;

3> upon transition from any cell selection state to camped normally state in NR:
4> if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport; and
4> if areaConfiguration is not included in VarLogMeasConfig or if the current camping cell is part of the area indicated by areaConfig of areaConfiguration in VarLogMeasConfig:

5> perform the logging;
\( 2> \) else if the reportType is set to eventTriggered and eventType is set to eventL1:
\( 3> \) if the UE is in camped normally state on an NR cell and if the RPLMN is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport:

4> if areaConfiguration is not included in VarLogMeasConfig; or
4> if the serving cell is part of the area indicated by areaConfig in areaConfiguration in VarLogMeasConfig;
\( 5> \) perform the logging at regular time intervals as defined by the loggingInterval in VarLogMeasConfig only when the conditions indicated by the eventLl are met;
\( 2> \) when performing the logging:
\( 3> \) if the UE detected IDC problems during the last logging interval:
4> if measResultServCell in VarLogMeasReport is not empty:
\( 5> \) include inDeviceCoexDetected;
\( 5> \) suspend measurement logging from the next logging interval;
4> else:
\( 5> \) suspend measurement logging;
3> set the relativeTimeStamp to indicate the elapsed time since the moment at which the logged measurement configuration was received;

3> if location information became available during the last logging interval, set the content of the locationInfo as in 5.3.3.7:

3> if the UE is in any cell selection state (as specified in TS 38.304 [20]):
4> set anyCellSelectionDetected to indicate the detection of no suitable or no acceptable cell found;
4> if the reportType is set to eventTriggered in the VarLogMeasConfig; and
4> if the RPLMN at the time of entering the any cell selection state is included in plmn-IdentityList stored in VarLogMeasReport; and

4- if areaConfiguration is not included in VarLogMeasConfig or if the last suitable cell that the UE was camping on is part of the area indicated by areaConfig of areaConfiguration in VarLogMeasConfig:
\( 5> \) set the servCellldentity to indicate global cell identity of the last suitable cell that the UE was camping on;
\( 5> \) set the measResultServingCell to include the quantities of the last suitable cell the UE was camping on;
