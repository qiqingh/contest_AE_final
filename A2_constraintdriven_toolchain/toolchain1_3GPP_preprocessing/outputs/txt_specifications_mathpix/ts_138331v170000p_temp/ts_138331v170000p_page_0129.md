1> perform the RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.3.4.
5.3.8 RRC connection release
5.3.8.1 General

Figure 5.3.8.1-1: RRC connection release, successful

The purpose of this procedure is:
- to release the RRC connection, which includes the release of the established radio bearers (except for broadcast MRBs), BH RLC channels, Uu Relay RLC channels as well as all radio resources; or
- to suspend the RRC connection only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup, which includes the suspension of the established radio bearers.
5.3.8.2 Initiation

The network initiates the RRC connection release procedure to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE; or to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for [AB, SRB2, is setup in RRC_CONNECTED; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE back to RRC_INACTIVE when the UE tries to resume; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE when the UE tries to resume. The procedure can also be used to release and redirect a UE to another frequency.
5.3.8.3 Reception of the RRCRelease by the UE

The UE shall:
1> delay the following actions defined in this clause 60 ms from the moment the RRCRelease message was received or optionally when lower layers indicate that the receipt of the RRCRelease message has been successfully acknowledged, whichever is earlier;
\( 1> \) stop timer T380, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T320, if running;
1> if timer T316 is running;
\( 2> \) stop timer T316;
\( 2> \) clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
\( 1> \) stop timer T350, if running;
\( 1> \) stop timer T346g, if running;
\( 1> \) if the AS security is not activated:
\( 2> \) ignore any field included in RRCRelease message except waitTime;
\( 2> \) perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with the release cause 'other' upon which the procedure ends;

1> if the RRCRelease message includes redirectedCarrierInfo indicating redirection to eutra:
