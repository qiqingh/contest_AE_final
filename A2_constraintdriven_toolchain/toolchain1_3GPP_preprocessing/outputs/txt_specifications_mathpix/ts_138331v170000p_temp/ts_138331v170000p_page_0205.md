\( 2> \) set the measResultsListSL to include the CBR measurement results in accordance with the following:
3> if the reportType is set to eventTriggered:
4> include the transmission resource pools included in the poolsTriggeredList as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;

3> else:
4> include the applicable transmission resource pools for which the new measurement results became available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was initiated or reset;
\( 3> \) if the corresponding measObject concerns NR sidelink communication, then for each transmission resource pool to be reported:
\( 4> \) set the \( s l \)-poolReportIdentity to the identity of this transmission resource pool;
4> set the \( s l \)-CBR-ResultsNR to the CBR measurement results on PSSCH and PSCCH of this transmission resource pool provided by lower layers, if available;

NOTE 1: Void.
\( 1> \) if there is at least one applicable CLI measurement resource to report:
\( 2> \) if the reportType is set to cli-EventTriggered or cli-Periodical:
3> set the measResultCLI to include the most interfering SRS resources or most interfering CLI-RSSI resources up to maxReportCLI in accordance with the following:

4> if the reportType is set to cli-EventTriggered:
\( 5> \) if trigger quantity is set to \( s r s-R S R P \) i.e. il-Threshold is set to srs-RSRP:
6> include the SRS resource included in the cli-TriggeredList as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
\( 5> \) if trigger quantity is set to cli-RSSI i.e il-Threshold is set to cli-RSSI:
\( 6> \) include the CLI-RSSI resource included in the cli-TriggeredList as defined within the VarMeasReportList for this measId;
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) if reportQuantity \( C L I \) is set to srs-rsrp:
6> include the applicable SRS resources for which the new measurement results became available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was initiated or reset;

5> else:
6> include the applicable CLI-RSSI resources for which the new measurement results became available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was initiated or reset;

4> for each SRS resource that is included in the measResultCLI:
\( 5> \) include the srs-Resourceld;
\( 5> \) set \( s r s-R S R P \)-Result to include the layer 3 filtered measured results in decreasing order, i.e. the most interfering SRS resource is included first;

4> for each CLI-RSSI resource that is included in the measResultCLI:
\( 5> \) include the rssi-Resourceld;
\( 5> \) set \( c i t \)-RSSI-Result to include the layer 3 filtered measured results in decreasing order, i.e the most interfering CLI-RSSI resource is included first;

1> if there is at least one applicable UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement to report:
