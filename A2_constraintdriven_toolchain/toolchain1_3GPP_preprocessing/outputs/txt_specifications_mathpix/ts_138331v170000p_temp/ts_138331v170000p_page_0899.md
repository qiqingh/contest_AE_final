- FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id

The IE FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id identifies a set of features applicable to one carrier of a feature set. The FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id of a FeatureSetUplinkPerCC is the index position of the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC. The first element in the list is referred to by FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id \( =1 \), and so on.

- FreqBandList

The IE FreqBandList is used by the network to request NR CA, NR non-CA and/or MR-DC band combinations for specific NR and/or E-UTRA frequency bands and/or up to a specific number of carriers and/or up to specific aggregated bandwidth. This is also used to request feature sets (for NR) and feature set combinations (for NR and MR-DC). For NR sidelink communication, this is used by the initiating UE to request sidelink UE radio access capabilities from the peer UE.
