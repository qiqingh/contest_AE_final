3> set the numberOfPreamblesSentOnSSB to indicate the number of successive random-access attempts associated to the SS/PBCH block;

3> for each random-access attempt performed on the random-access resource, include the following parameters in the chronological order of the random-access attempt:

4 - if the random-access attempt is performed on the contention based random-access resource and if raPurpose is not equal to 'requestForOtherSF, include contentionDetected as follows:

5> if contention resolution was not successful as specified in TS 38.321 [6] for the transmitted preamble:
\( 6> \) set the contentionDetected to true;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) set the contentionDetected to false;
\( 4> \) if the random access attempt is a 2 -step random access attempt:
5> if fallback from 2-step random access to 4-step random access occurred during the random access attempt:

6> set fallbackToFourStepRA to true;
5> else:
6> set fallbackToFourStepRA to false;
\( 4> \) if the random-access attempt is performed on the contention based random-access resource; or
4> if the random-access attempt is performed on the contention free random-access resource and if the random-access procedure was initiated due to the PDCCH ordering:
\( 5> \) if the random access attempt is a 4 -step random access attempt and the SS/PBCH block RSRP of the SS/PBCH block corresponding to the random-access resource used in the random-access attempt is above rsrp-ThresholdSSB; or
\( 5> \) if the random access attempt is a 2 -step random access attempt and the SS/PBCH block RSRP of the SS/PBCH block corresponding to the random-access resource used in the random-access attempt is above msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB:
\( 6> \) set the dIRSRPAboveThreshold to true;
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) set the diRSRPAboveThreshold to false;
2> else if the random-access resource used is associated to a CSI-RS, set the associated random-access parameters for the successive random-access attempts associated to the same CSI-RS for one or more random-access attempts as follows:

3> set the csi-RS-Index to include the CSI-RS index associated to the used random-access resource;
3> set the numberOfPreamblesSentOnCSI-RS to indicate the number of successive random-access attempts associated to the CSI-RS.
