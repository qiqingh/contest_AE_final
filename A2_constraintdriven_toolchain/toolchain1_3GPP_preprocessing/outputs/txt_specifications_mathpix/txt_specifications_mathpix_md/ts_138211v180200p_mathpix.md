4.3 Frame structure
4.3.1 Frames and subframes

Downlink, uplink, and sidelink transmissions are organized into frames with \( T_{\mathrm{f}}=\left(\Delta f_{\max } N_{\mathrm{f}} / 100\right) \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}=10 \mathrm{~ms} \) duration, each consisting of ten subframes of \( T_{\mathrm{sf}}=\left(\Delta f_{\mathrm{max}} N_{\mathrm{f}} / 1000\right) \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}=1 \mathrm{~ms} \) duration. The number of consecutive OFDM symbols per subframe is \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu}=N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu} \). Each frame is divided into two equally-sized half-frames of five subframes each with half-frame 0 consisting of subframes \( 0-4 \) and half-frame 1 consisting of subframes \( 5-9 \).

There is one set of frames in the uplink and one set of frames in the downlink on a carrier.
Uplink frame number \( i \) for transmission from the UE shall start \( T_{\mathrm{TA}}=\left(N_{\mathrm{TA}}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\text {common }}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\mathrm{UE}}\right) T_{\mathrm{c}} \) before the start of the corresponding downlink frame at the UE where
- \( N_{\mathrm{TA}} \) and \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }} \) are given by clause 4.2 of [5, TS 38.213], except for msgA transmission on PUSCH where \( N_{\mathrm{TA}}= \) 0 shall be used;
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\text {common }} \) given by clause 4.2 of [5, TS 38.213] is derived from the higher-layer parameters \( t a \)-Common, taCommonDrift, and ta-CommonDriftVariant if configured, otherwise \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\text {common }}=0 \);
- \( \quad N_{\text {TA,adj }}^{\mathrm{UE}} \) given by clause 4.2 of [5, TS 38.213] is computed by the UE based on UE position and serving-satellite-ephemeris-related higher-layers parameters if configured, otherwise \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{adj}}^{\mathrm{UE}}=0 \).

4.3.2 Slots

For subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \), slots are numbered \( n_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mu} \in\left\{0, \ldots, N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu}-1\right\} \) in increasing order within a subframe and \( n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu} \in\left\{0, \ldots, N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}-1\right\} \) in increasing order within a frame. There are \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) consecutive OFDM symbols in a slot where \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) depends on the cyclic prefix as given by Tables 4.3.2-1 and 4.3.2-2. The start of slot \( n_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mu} \) in a subframe is aligned in time with the start of OFDM symbol \( n_{s}^{\mu} N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) in the same subframe.

OFDM symbols in a slot in a downlink or uplink frame can be classified as 'downlink', 'flexible', or 'uplink'. Signaling of slot formats is described in clause 11.1 of [5, TS 38.213].

In a slot in a downlink frame, the UE shall assume that downlink transmissions only occur in 'downlink' or 'flexible' symbols.

In a slot in an uplink frame, the UE shall only transmit in 'uplink' or 'flexible' symbols.
A UE not capable of full-duplex communication and not supporting simultaneous transmission and reception as defined by parameter simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC, simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA or simultaneousRxTxSUL [10, TS 38.306] among all cells within a group of cells is not expected to transmit in the uplink in one cell within the group of cells earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last received downlink symbol in the same or different cell within the group of cells where \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

A UE not capable of full-duplex communication and not supporting simultaneous transmission and reception as defined by parameter simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC, simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA or simultaneousRxTxSUL [10, TS 38.306] among all cells within a group of cells is not expected to receive in the downlink in one cell within the group of cells earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last transmitted uplink symbol in the same or different cell within the group of cells where \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

For DAPS handover operation, a UE not capable of full-duplex communication is not expected to transmit in the uplink to a cell earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last received downlink symbol in the different cell where \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

4.4 Physical resources
4.4.1 Antenna ports

An antenna port is defined such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed.

Two antenna ports are said to be quasi co-located if the large-scale properties of the channel over which a symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a symbol on the other antenna port is conveyed. The large-scale properties include one or more of delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, average delay, and spatial Rx parameters.
4.4.2 Resource grid

For each numerology and carrier, a resource grid of \( N_{\text {grid, } x}^{\text {size, } \mu} N_{\text {sc }}^{\mathrm{RB}} \) subcarriers and \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {subframe, } \mu} \) OFDM symbols is defined, starting at common resource block \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) indicated by higher-layer signalling. There is one set of resource grids per transmission direction (uplink, downlink, or sidelink) with the subscript \( x \) set to DL, UL, and SL for downlink, uplink, and sidelink, respectively. When there is no risk for confusion, the subscript \( x \) may be dropped. There is one resource grid for a given antenna port \( p \), subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \), and transmission direction (downlink, uplink, or sidelink).

For uplink and downlink, the carrier bandwidth \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {size }, \mu} \) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) is given by the higherlayer parameter carrierBandwidth in the SCS-SpecificCarrier IE. The starting position \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {start } \mu} \) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) is given by the higher-layer parameter offsetToCarrier in the SCS-SpecificCarrier IE.

The frequency location of a subcarrier refers to the center frequency of that subcarrier.
For the downlink, the higher-layer parameter txDirectCurrentLocation in the SCS-SpecificCarrier IE indicates the location of the transmitter DC subcarrier in the downlink for each of the numerologies configured in the downlink. Values in the range 0-3299 represent the number of the DC subcarrier and the value 3300 indicates that the DC subcarrier is located outside the resource grid.

For the uplink, the higher-layer parameter txDirectCurrentLocation in the UplinkTxDirectCurrentBWP IE indicates the location of the transmitter DC subcarrier in the uplink for each of the configured bandwidth parts, including whether the DC subcarrier location is offset by 7.5 kHz relative to the center of the indicated subcarrier or not. Values in the range 0 - 3299 represent the number of the DC subcarrier, the value 3300 indicates that the DC subcarrier is located outside the resource grid, and the value 3301 indicates that the position of the DC subcarrier in the uplink is undetermined.
4.4.3 Resource elements

Each element in the resource grid for antenna port \( p \) and subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) is called a resource element and is uniquely identified by \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) where \( k \) is the index in the frequency domain and \( l \) refers to the symbol position in the time domain relative to some reference point. Resource element \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) corresponds to a physical resource and the complex value \( a_{k, l}^{(p, \mu)} \). When there is no risk for confusion, or no particular antenna port or subcarrier spacing is specified, the indices \( p \) and \( \mu \) may be dropped, resulting in \( a_{k, l}^{(p)} \) or \( a_{k, l} \).

4.4.4 Resource blocks
4.4.4.1 General

A resource block is defined as \( N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}=12 \) consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain.
4.4.4.2 Point A

Point A serves as a common reference point for resource block grids and is obtained from:
- offsetToPointA for a PCell downlink where offsetToPointA represents the frequency offset between point A and the lowest subcarrier of the lowest resource block, which overlaps with the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, used by the UE for initial cell selection, expressed in units of resource blocks assuming 15 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR1 and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR2;
- for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon;
- for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 or FR2, and for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing same as the SS/PBCH block used by the UE for initial cell selection;
- absoluteFrequencyPointA for all other cases where absoluteFrequencyPointA represents the frequency-location of point A expressed as in ARFCN.
4.4.4.3 Common resource blocks

Common resource blocks are numbered from 0 and upwards in the frequency domain for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \). The center of subcarrier 0 of common resource block 0 for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) coincides with 'point A'.

The relation between the common resource block number \( n_{\text {CRB }}^{\mu} \) in the frequency domain and resource elements ( \( k, l \) ) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mu}=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}}\right\rfloor
\]
where \( k \) is defined relative to point A such that \( k=0 \) corresponds to the subcarrier centered around point A .
4.4.4.4 Physical resource blocks

Physical resource blocks for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) are defined within a bandwidth part and numbered from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu}-1 \) where \( i \) is the number of the bandwidth part. The relation between the physical resource block \( n_{\mathrm{PRB}}^{\mu} \) in band width part \( i \) and the common resource block \( n_{\text {CRB }}^{\mu} \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mu}=n_{\mathrm{PRB}}^{\mu}+N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}
\]
where \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \) is the common resource block where band width part \( i \) starts relative to common resource block 0 . When there is no risk for confusion the index \( \mu \) may be dropped.
4.4.4.5 Virtual resource blocks

Virtual resource blocks are defined within a bandwidth part and numbered from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\text {size }}-1 \) where \( i \) is the number of the bandwidth part.
4.4.4.6 Interlaced resource blocks

Multiple interlaces of resource blocks are defined where interlace \( m \in\{0,1, \ldots, M-1\} \) consists of common resource blocks \( \{m, M+m, 2 M+m, 3 M+m, \ldots\} \), with \( M \) being the number of interlaces given by Table 4.4.4.6-1. The relation

between the interlaced resource block \( n_{1 \mathrm{RB}, m}^{\mu} \in\{0,1, \ldots\} \) in bandwidth part \( i \) and interlace \( m \) and the common resource block \( n_{\text {CRB }}^{\mu} \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mu}=M n_{\mathrm{JRB}, m}^{\mu}+N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}+\left(\left(m-N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}\right) \bmod M\right)
\]
where \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \) is the common resource block where band width part starts relative to common resource block 0 . When there is no risk for confusion the index \( \mu \) may be dropped.

The UE expects that the number of common resource blocks in an interlace contained within bandwidth part \( i \) is no less than 10 .

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
4.4.5 Bandwidth part

A bandwidth part is a subset of contiguous common resource blocks defined in clause 4.4.4.3 for a given numerology \( \mu_{i} \) in bandwidth part \( i \) on a given carrier. The starting position \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \) and the number of resource blocks \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu} \) in a bandwidth part shall fulfil \( N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu} \leq N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu}<N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu}+N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{size}, \mu} \) and \( N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu}<N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu}+N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\operatorname{size}, \mu} \leq N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{start}, \mu}+N_{\operatorname{grid}, x}^{\operatorname{size}, \mu} \), respectively. Configuration of a bandwidth part is described in clause 12 of [5, TS 38.213].

A UE can be configured with up to four bandwidth parts in the downlink with a single downlink bandwidth part being active at a given time. The UE is not expected to receive PDSCH, PDCCH, or CSI-RS (except for RRM) outside an active band width part.

A UE can be configured with up to four bandwidth parts in the uplink with a single uplink bandwidth part being active at a given time. If a UE is configured with a supplementary uplink, the UE can in addition be configured with up to four bandwidth parts in the supplementary uplink with a single supplementary uplink bandwidth part being active at a given time. The UE shall not transmit PUSCH or PUCCH outside an active bandwidth part. For an active cell, the UE shall not transmit SRS outside an active bandwidth part.

Unless otherwise noted, the description in this specification applies to each of the bandwidth parts. When there is no risk of confusion, the index \( \mu \) may be dropped from \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}, N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu}, N_{\mathrm{grid}, x}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \), and \( N_{\mathrm{grid}, x}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu} \) -
4.4.6 Common MBS frequency resource

A common MBS frequency resource is a contiguous set of common resource blocks. The starting position \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) of the common MBS frequency resource \( i \) is defined relative to point A and the size of the common MBS frequency resource is given by \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {size }, \mu} \). Resource blocks in a common MBS frequency resource are numbered in the same way as resource blocks in clause 4.4.4.4 with \( N_{\text {BWP }, i}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) and \( N_{\text {BWP }, i}^{\text {size }, \mu} \) replaced by \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) and \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {size }, \mu} \), respectively.

A UE is not expected to receive PDSCH or PDCCH associated with MBS transmissions scheduled with G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI, or multicast-MCCH-RNTI outside the common MBS frequency resource.
4.5 Carrier aggregation

Transmissions in multiple cells can be aggregated. Unless otherwise noted, the description in this specification applies to each of the serving cells.

For carrier aggregation of cells with unaligned frame boundaries, the slot offset \( N_{\text {slot, off set }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) between a PCell/PScell and an SCell is determined by higher-layer parameter ca-SlotOffset for the SCell. The quantity \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \) is defined as the maximum of the lowest subcarrier spacing configuration among the subcarrier spacings given by the higher-layer parameters scs-SpecificCarrierList configured for PCell/PSCell and the SCell, respectively. The slot offset \( N_{\text {slot, }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) offset fulfills

- when the lowest subcarrier spacing configuration among the subcarrier spacings configured for the cell is \( \mu=2 \) for both cells or \( \mu=3 \) for both cells, the start of slot 0 for the cell whose point A has a lower frequency coincides with the start of slot \( q N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }} \mu_{\text {offset }} \) for the other cell where \( q=-1 \) if point A of the PCell/PSCell has a frequency lower than the frequency of point A for the SCell, otherwise \( q=1 \);
- otherwise, the start of slot 0 for the cell with the lower subcarrier spacing of the lowest subcarrier spacing given by the higher-layer parameters scs-SpecificCarrierList configured for the two cells, or the Pcell/PSCell if both cells have the same lowest subcarrier spacing given by the higher-layer parameters scs-SpecificCarrierList configured for the two cells, coincides with the start of slot \( q N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }} \mu_{\text {offset }} \) for the other cell where \( q=-1 \) if the lowest subcarreier spacing configuration given by scs-SpecificCarrierList of the PCell/PSCell is smaller than or equal to the lowest subcarrier spacing given by scs-SpectficCarrierList for the SCell, otherwise \( q=1 \).

5.2 Sequence generation
5.2.1 Pseudo-random sequence generation

Generic pseudo-random sequences are defined by a length-31 Gold sequence. The output sequence \( c(n) \) of length \( M_{\text {PN }} \) , where \( n=0,1, \ldots, M_{\text {PN }}-1 \), is defined by
\[
\begin{aligned}
c(n) & =\left(x_{1}\left(n+N_{c}\right)+x_{2}\left(n+N_{c}\right)\right) \bmod 2 \\
x_{1}(n+31) & =\left(x_{1}(n+3)+x_{1}(n)\right) \bmod 2 \\
x_{2}(n+31) & =\left(x_{2}(n+3)+x_{2}(n+2)+x_{2}(n+1)+x_{2}(n)\right) \bmod 2
\end{aligned}
\]
where \( N_{C}=1600 \) and the first m-sequence \( x_{l}(n) \) shall be initialized with \( x_{l}(0)=1, x_{l}(n)=0, n=1,2 \ldots, 30 \). The initialization of the second \( m \)-sequence, \( x_{2}(n) \), is denoted by \( c_{\text {init }}=\sum_{i=0}^{30} x_{2}(i) \cdot 2^{i} \) with the value depending on the application of the sequence.
5.2.2 Low-PAPR sequence generation type 1

The low-PAPR sequence \( r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n) \) is defined by a cyclic shift \( \alpha \) of a base sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(n) \) according to
\[
r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n)=e^{j a n} \bar{r}_{u, v}(n), \quad 0 \leq n<M_{\mathrm{ZC}}
\]
where \( M_{\mathrm{ZC}}=m N_{\mathrm{sC}}^{\mathrm{RB}} / 2^{\delta} \) is the length of the sequence. Multiple sequences are defined from a single base sequence through different values of \( \alpha \) and \( \delta \).

Base sequences \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(n) \) are divided into groups, where \( u \in\{0,1, \ldots, 29\} \) is the group number and \( v \) is the base sequence number within the group, such that each group contains one base sequence \( (v=0) \) of each length \( M_{\mathrm{ZC}}=m N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} / 2^{\delta} \), \( 1 / 2 \leq m / 2^{\delta} \leq 5 \) and two base sequences ( \( v=0,1 \) ) of each length \( M_{\mathrm{ZC}}=m N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} / 2^{\delta}, 6 \leq m / 2^{\delta} \). The definition of the base sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(0), \ldots, \bar{r}_{u, v}\left(M_{Z C}-1\right) \) depends on the sequence length \( M_{Z C} \) -
5.2.2.1 Base sequences of length 36 or larger

For \( M_{\mathrm{ZC}} \geq 3 N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} \), the base sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, \nu}(0), \ldots, \bar{r}_{u, \nu}\left(M_{\mathrm{ZC}}-1\right) \) is given by
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\bar{r}_{w, v}(n)=x_{q}\left(n \bmod N_{Z C}\right) \\
x_{q}(m)=e^{-j \frac{\pi m(m+1)}{N_{Z C}}}
\end{array}
\]
where
\[
\begin{array}{l}
q=\lfloor\bar{q}+1 / 2\rfloor+v \cdot(-1)^{\lfloor 2 \bar{q}\rfloor} \\
\bar{q}=N_{\mathrm{ZC}} \cdot(u+1) / 31
\end{array}
\]

The length \( N_{Z C} \) is given by the largest prime number such that \( N_{Z C}<M_{Z C} \) -
5.2.2.2 Base sequences of length less than 36

For \( M_{Z C} \in\{6,12,18,24\} \) the base sequence is given by
\[
\bar{r}_{u, v}(n)=e^{j \varphi(n) \pi / 4}, \quad 0 \leq n \leq M_{\mathrm{ZC}}-1
\]
where the value of \( \varphi(n) \) is given by Tables 5.2.2.2-1 to 5.2.2.2-4.
For \( M_{Z C}=30 \), the base sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(0), \ldots, \bar{r}_{u, v}\left(M_{Z C}-1\right) \) is given by
\[
\bar{r}_{w, v}(n)=e^{-j \frac{\pi(w+l)(n+l)(n+2)}{3 l}}, 0 \leq n \leq M_{Z C}-1

5.2.3 Low-PAPR sequence generation type 2

The low-PAPR sequence \( r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n) \) is defined by a base sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(n) \) according to
\[
r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n)=\bar{r}_{u, v}(n), \quad 0 \leq n<M
\]
where \( M=m N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} / 2^{\delta} \) is the length of the sequence.
Base sequences \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(n) \) are divided into groups, where \( u \in\{0,1, \ldots, 29\} \) is the group number and \( v \) is the base sequence number within the group, such that each group contains one base sequence ( \( v=0 \) ) of length \( M=m N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} / 2^{\delta} \), \( 1 / 2 \leq m / 2^{\delta} \). The sequence \( \bar{r}_{u, v}(0), \ldots, \bar{r}_{u, v}(M-1) \) is defined by
\[
\begin{aligned}
\bar{r}_{u, v}(n) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \tilde{r}_{u, v}(i) e^{-j \frac{2 \pi i n}{M}} \\
n & =0, \ldots, M-1
\end{aligned}
\]
where the definition of \( \tilde{r}_{u, v}(i) \) depends on the sequence length.
5.2.3.1 Sequences of length 30 or larger

For \( M \geq 30 \), the sequence \( \tilde{r}_{u, v}(i) \) is obtained as the complex-valued modulations symbols resulting from \( \pi / 2 \)-BPSK modulation as defined in clause 5.1.1 applied to the binary sequence \( c(i) \) given by clause 5.2.1, initialized with \( c_{\text {init- }} \)
5.2.3.2 Sequences of length less than 30

For \( M=6 \), the sequence \( \tilde{r}_{u, v}(i) \) is given by

- Physical Random Access Channel, PRACH
6.1.2 Overview of physical signals

6.2 Physical resources

The frame structure and physical resources the UE shall use when transmitting in the uplink transmissions are defined in Clause 4.

The following antenna ports are defined for the uplink:
- Antenna ports starting with 0 for demodulation reference signals for PUSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 1000 for SRS, PUSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PUCCH
- Antenna port 4000 for PRACH

If PUSCH repetition Type B as described in clause 6.1 of [6, TS38.214] is applied to a physical channel, the UE transmission shall be such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port used for uplink transmission is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed if the two symbols correspond to the same actual repetition of a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type B.

If intra-slot frequency hopping is not enabled for a physical channel and PUSCH repetition Type B is not applied to the physical channel, the UE transmission shall be such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port used for uplink transmission is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed if the two symbols correspond to the same slot.

If intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled for a physical channel, the UE transmission shall be such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port used for uplink transmission is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols correspond to the same frequency hop, regardless of whether the frequency hop distance is zero or not.

If DM-RS bundling is applied to PUSCH and/or PUCCH repetitions and/or transport-block processing over multiple slots as described in clause 6.1 . 7 of [6,38.214], the UE transmission shall be such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port used for uplink transmission is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed if the two symbols are transmitted within the same actual time-domain window.

If transform precoding is not enabled according to 6.13 of \( [6, \operatorname{TS38.214}], y^{(\lambda)}(i)=x^{(\lambda)}(i) \) for each layer \( \lambda=0,1, \ldots, v-1 \).

If transform precoding is enabled according to 6.1 .3 of \( [6, \mathrm{TS} 38.214], v=1 \) and \( \tilde{x}^{(p)}(i) \) depends on the configuration of phase-tracking reference signals.

If the procedure in [6, TS 38.214] indicates that phase-tracking reference signals are not being used, the block of complex-valued symbols \( x^{(0)}(0), \ldots, x^{(0)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }}-1\right) \) for the single layer \( \lambda=0 \) shall be divided into \( M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }} / M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}} \) sets, each corresponding to one OFDM symbol and \( \tilde{x}^{(p)}(i)=x^{(p)}(i) \).

If the procedure in [6, TS 38.214] indicates that phase-tracking reference signals are being used, the block of complexvalued symbols \( x^{(0)}(0), \ldots, x^{(0)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }}-1\right) \) shall be divided into sets, each set corresponding to one OFDM symbol, and where set \( l \) contains \( M_{\text {sc }}^{\text {PUSCH }}-\varepsilon_{1} N_{\text {samp }}^{\text {group }} N_{\text {group }}^{\text {PTRS }} \) symbols and is mapped to the complex-valued symbols
\( \tilde{x}^{(0)}\left(l M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}+i^{\prime}\right) \) corresponding to OFDM symbol \( l \) prior to transform precoding, with \( i^{\prime} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}-1\right\} \) and \( i^{\prime} \neq m \). The index \( m \) of PT-RS samples in set \( l \), the number of samples per PT-RS group \( N_{\text {samp }}^{\text {group }} \), and the number of PT-RS groups \( N_{\text {group }}^{\text {PT-RS }} \) are defined in clause 6.4.1.2.2.2. The quantity \( \varepsilon_{j}=1 \) when OFDM symbol \( l \) contains one or more PT-RS samples, otherwise \( \varepsilon_{j}=0 \).

Transform precoding shall be applied according to
\[
\begin{aligned}
y^{(\mathrm{v})}\left(l \cdot M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}+k\right) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}}} \sum_{i=0}^{M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\text {PuscH }}-1} \tilde{x}^{(\mathrm{v})}\left(l \cdot M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}+i\right) e^{-j \frac{2 \pi i k}{M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\text {PLSCH }}}} \\

l & =0, \ldots, M_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\text {layer }} / M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}-1
\end{aligned}
\]
resulting in a block of complex-valued symbols \( y^{(0)}(0), \ldots, y^{(0)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }}-1\right) \). The variable \( M_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}=M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} \), where \( M_{\text {RB }}^{\text {PUSCH }} \) represents the bandwidth of the PUSCH in terms of resource blocks, and shall fulfil
\[
M_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{PUSCH}}=2^{\alpha_{2}} \cdot 3^{\alpha_{3}} \cdot 5^{\alpha_{5}}
\]
where \( \alpha_{2}, \alpha_{3}, \alpha_{5} \) is a set of non-negative integers.
6.3.1.5 Precoding

The block of vectors \( \left[y^{(0)}(i) \quad \ldots \quad y^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{\mathrm{T}} \) shall be precoded according to
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
z^{\left(p_{0}\right)}(i) \\
\vdots \\
z^{\left(p_{\rho-1}\right)}(i)
\end{array}\right]=W\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{(0)}(i) \\
\vdots \\
y^{(v-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \( i=0,1, \ldots, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}=M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }} \). The set of antenna ports \( \left\{p_{0}, \ldots, p_{\rho-1}\right\} \) shall be determined according to the procedure in [6, TS 38.214].

For non-codebook-based transmission, the precoding matrix \( W \) equals the identity matrix.
For codebook-based transmission, the precoding matrix \( W \) depends on the number of antenna ports used for the transmission:

6.3.1.6 Mapping to virtual resource blocks

For each of the antenna ports used for transmission of the PUSCH, the block of complex-valued symbols \( z^{(p)}(0), \ldots, z^{(p)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1\right) \) shall be multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {PUSCH }} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS 38-213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( z^{(p)}(0) \) to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission which meet all of the following criteria:
- they are in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission, and
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS, PT-RS, or DM-RS intended for other co-scheduled UEs as described in clause 6.4.1.1.3

The mapping to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) allocated for PUSCH according to [ 6, TS 38.214] shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks, where \( k^{\prime}=0 \) is the first subcarrier in the lowest-

numbered virtual resource block assigned for transmission, and then the index \( l \), with the starting position given by [ 6 , TS 38.214].
6.3.1.7 Mapping from virtual to physical resource blocks

Virtual resource blocks shall be mapped to physical resource blocks according to non-interleaved mapping.
For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping for uplink resource allocation types 0 and 1 [6, TS 38.214], virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n \) except for PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant or PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI in active uplink band width part \( i \) starting at \( N_{\text {BWP, } i} \), including all resource blocks of the initial uplink bandwidth part starting at \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, 0}^{\mathrm{start}} \), and having the same subcarrier spacing and cyclic prefix as the initial uplink bandwidth part, in which case virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n+N_{\mathrm{BWP}, 0}^{\mathrm{start}}-N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}} \) -

For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping for uplink resource allocation type 2 [6, TS 38.214], virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n \).

The physical uplink control channel supports multiple formats as shown in Table 6.3.2.1-1. In case intra-slot frequency hopping is configured for PUCCH formats 1,3, or 4 according to clause 9.2.1 of [5, TS38.213], the number of symbols in the first hop is given by \( \left\lfloor N_{\text {symb }}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}} / 2\right\rfloor \) where \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}} \) is the length of the PUCCH transmission in OFDM symbols.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.3.2.1-1: PUCCH formats.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline PUCCH format & Length in OFDM symbols \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\mathrm{PUCCH}} \) & Number of bits \\
\hline 0 & 1-2 & \( \leq 2 \) \\
\hline 1 & 4-14 & \( \leq 2 \) \\
\hline 2 & 1-2 & >2 \\
\hline 3 & 4-14 & >2 \\
\hline 4 & 4-14 & >2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.3.2.2 Sequence and cyclic shift hopping

PUCCH formats \( 0,1,3 \), and 4 use sequences \( r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n) \) given by clause 5.2 .2 with \( \delta=0 \) where the sequence group \( u \) and the sequence number \( v \) depend on the sequence hopping in clause 6.3.2.2.1 and the cyclic shift \( \alpha \) depends on the cyclic shift hopping in clause 6.3.2.2.2.
6.3.2.2.1 Group and sequence hopping

The sequence group \( u=\left(f_{\mathrm{gh}}+f_{\mathrm{ss}}\right) \bmod 30 \) and the sequence number \( v \) within the group depends on the higher-layer parameter pucch-GroupHopping:
- if pucch-GroupHopping equals 'neither'
\[
\begin{aligned}
f_{\mathrm{gh}} & =0 \\
f_{\mathrm{ss}} & =n_{1 \mathrm{D}} \bmod 30 \\
v & =0
\end{aligned}
\]
where \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter hoppingld if configured, otherwise \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}}=N_{1 \mathrm{D}} \) cell .
- if pucch-GroupHopping equals 'enable'

\end{aligned}
\]
where the pseudo-random sequence \( c(i) \) is defined by clause 5.2 .1 and shall be initialized at the beginning of each radio frame with \( c_{\text {init }}=\left\lfloor n_{1 \mathrm{D}} / 30\right\rfloor \) where \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter hopping Id if configured, otherwise \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}}=N_{1 \mathrm{D}}^{\text {cell }} \).
- if pucch-GroupHopping equals 'disable'
\[
\begin{aligned}
f_{\mathrm{gh}} & =0 \\

The frequency hopping index \( n_{\text {h } \text { op }}=0 \) if intra-slot frequency hopping is disabled by the higher-layer parameter intraSlotFrequencyHopping. If frequency hopping is enabled by the higher-layer parameter intraSlotFrequencyHopping, \( n_{\text {hop }}=0 \) for the first hop and \( n_{\text {hop }}=1 \) for the second hop.
6.3.2.2.2 Cyclic shift hopping

The cyclic shift \( \alpha \) varies as a function of the symbol and slot number according to
\[
\alpha_{l}=\frac{2 \pi}{N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}}\left(\left(m_{0}+m_{\mathrm{cs}}+m_{\mathrm{int}}+n_{\mathrm{cs}}\left(n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f},}^{\mu} l+l^{\prime}\right)\right) \bmod N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}\right)
\]

- \( n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu} \) is the slot number in the radio frame
- \( l \) is the OFDM symbol number in the PUCCH transmission where \( l=0 \) corresponds to the first OFDM symbol of the PUCCH transmission,
- \( l^{\prime} \) is the index of the OFDM symbol in the slot that corresponds to the first OFDM symbol of the PUCCH transmission in the slot given by [5, TS 38.213]
- \( m_{0} \) is given by [5, TS 38.213] for PUCCH format 0 and 1 while for PUCCH format 3 and 4 is defined in clause 6.4.1.3.3.1
- \( m_{\mathrm{cs}}=0 \) except for PUCCH format 0 when it depends on the information to be transmitted according to clause 9.2 of [5, TS 38.213].
- \( m_{\text {int }} \) is given by
- \( m_{\text {int }}=5 n_{\text {IRB }}^{\mu} \) for PUCCH formats 0 and 1 if PUCCH shall use interlaced mapping according to any of the higher-layer parameters uselnterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon or uselnterlacePUCCHPUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated, where \( n_{1 \mathrm{RB}}^{\mu} \) is the resource block number within the interlace;
- \( m_{\text {int }}=0 \) otherwise

The function \( n_{\mathrm{cs}}\left(n_{\mathrm{c}}, l\right) \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{cs}}\left(n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu} l\right)=\sum_{m=0}^{7} 2^{m} c\left(8 N_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\mathrm{slot}} n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu}+8 l+m\right)

- they are in the resource blocks assigned for transmission,
- they are not used by the associated DM-RS

The mapping to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) not reserved for other purposes shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k \) over the assigned physical resource blocks according to clause 9.2.1 of [5, TS 38.213], and then the index \( l \) on antenna port \( p=2000 \).

6.3.3 Physical random-access channel
6.3.3.1 Sequence generation

The set of random-access preambles \( x_{u, v}(n) \) shall be generated according to
\[
\begin{aligned}
x_{u, v}(n) & =x_{u}\left(\left(n+C_{v}\right) \bmod L_{\mathrm{RA}}\right) \\
x_{u}(i) & =e^{-j \frac{\pi u(i+1)}{L_{\mathrm{RA}}}}, i=0,1, \ldots, L_{\mathrm{RA}}-1
\end{aligned}
\]
from which the frequency-domain representation shall be generated according to
\[
y_{i t, v}(n)=\sum_{m=0}^{L_{\mathrm{RA}}-1} x_{i t, v}(m) \cdot e^{-j \frac{2 m m r}{L_{\mathrm{RA}}}}
\]
where \( L_{\mathrm{RA}}=839, L_{\mathrm{RA}}=139, L_{\mathrm{RA}}=1151 \), or \( L_{\mathrm{RA}}=571 \) depending on the PRACH preamble format as given by Tables 6.3.3.1-1 and 6.3.3.1-2.

There are 64 preambles defined in each time-frequency PRACH occasion, enumerated in increasing order of first increasing cyclic shift \( C_{v} \) of a logical root sequence, and then in increasing order of the logical root sequence index, starting with the index obtained from the higher-layer parameter prach-RootSequenceIndex or rootSequenceIndex-BFR or by msgA-PRACH-RootSequencelndex if configured and a type-2 random-access procedure is initiated as described in clause 8.1 of [5, TS 38.213]. Additional preamble sequences, in case 64 preambles cannot be generated from a single root Zadoff-Chu sequence, are obtained from the root sequences with the consecutive logical indexes until all the 64 sequences are found. The logical root sequence order is cyclic; the logical index 0 is consecutive to \( L_{\mathrm{RA}}-2 \). The sequence number \( u \) is obtained from the logical root sequence index according to Tables 6.3.3.1-3 to 6.3.3.1-4B.

The cyclic shift \( C_{v} \) is given by
\[
\begin{array}{l}
C_{v}=\left\{\begin{array}{lll}
v N_{\mathrm{CS}} & v=0,1, \ldots,\left\lfloor L_{\mathrm{RA}} / N_{\mathrm{CS}}\right\rfloor-1, N_{\mathrm{CS}} \neq 0 & \text { for unrestricted sets } \\
0 & N_{\mathrm{CS}}=0 & \text { for unrestricted sets } \\
d_{\text {start }}\left\lfloor v / n_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}\right\rfloor+\left(v \bmod n_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}\right) N_{\mathrm{CS}} & v=0,1, \ldots, w-1 & \text { for restricted sets type } \mathrm{A} \text { and } \mathrm{B} \\
\overline{\bar{d}}_{\text {start }}+(v-w) N_{\mathrm{CS}} & v=w_{r}, w+\overline{\bar{n}}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}-1 & \text { for restricted sets type } \mathrm{B} \\
\overline{\bar{d}}_{\text {start }}+\left(v-w-\overline{\bar{n}}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}\right) N_{\mathrm{CS}} & v=w+\overline{\bar{n}}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}} \ldots, w+\overline{\bar{n}}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}+\overline{\bar{n}}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}-1 & \text { for restricted sets type } \mathrm{B}
\end{array}\right. \\
w=n_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}} n_{\text {goup }}^{\mathrm{RA}}+\bar{n}_{\text {shift }}^{\mathrm{RA}}
\end{array}
\]
where \( N_{C S} \) is given by Tables 6.3.3.1-5 to 6.3.3.1-7, the higher-layer parameter msgA-RestrictedSetConfig, if provided, determines the type of restricted sets (unrestricted, restricted type A , restricted type B ); otherwise, the higher-layer parameter restrictedSetConfig determines the type of restricted sets (unrestricted, restricted type A , restricted type B ), and Tables 6.3.3.1-1 and 6.3.3.1-2 indicate the type of restricted sets supported for the different preamble formats.

The variable \( d_{w} \) is given by
\[
d_{w}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
q & 0 \leq q<L_{\mathrm{RA}} / 2 \\
L_{\mathrm{RA}}-q & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\]
where \( q \) is the smallest non-negative integer that fulfils \( (q u) \bmod L_{\mathrm{RA}}=1 \). The parameters for restricted sets of cyclic shifts depend on \( d_{w} \) -

For restricted set type A , the parameters are given by:
- for \( N_{\mathrm{CS}} \leq d_{w}<L_{\mathrm{RA}} / 3 \)

6.3.3.2 Mapping to physical resources

The preamble sequence shall be mapped to physical resources according to
\[
\begin{aligned}
a_{k}^{(\rho, \mathrm{RA})} & =\beta_{\mathrm{PRACH}} y_{u, v}(k) \\
k & =0,1, \ldots, L_{\mathrm{RA}}-1
\end{aligned}
\]
where \( \beta_{\text {PRACH }} \) is an amplitude scaling factor in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS38.213], and \( p=4000 \) is the antenna port. Baseband signal generation shall be done according to clause 5.3 using the parameters in Table 6.3.3.1-1 or Table 6.3.3.1-2 with \( \bar{k} \) given by Table 6.3.3.2-1.

Random access preambles can only be transmitted in the time resources obtained from Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 and depends on FR1 or FR2 and the spectrum type as defined in [8, TS38.104]. The PRACH configuration index in Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 is

- for Table 6.3.3.2-3 given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationIndex, or by msgA-PRACHConfigurationIndex if configured; and
- for Tables 6.3.3.2-2 and 6.3.3.2-4 given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationIndex, or by msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex if configured.

For the IAB-MT part of an IAB-node, the following applies:
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationPeriodScaling-IAB is configured, the variable \( x \) used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \) of Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}} \), where \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}}=\delta x \) and \( \delta \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationPeriodScaling-IAB and the [AB-node does not expect \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}} \) to be larger than 64 ;
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationFrameOffset-IAB is configured, the variable \( y \) used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \) of Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( y_{\text {IAB }}=(y+\Delta y) \bmod x \) where \( \Delta y \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationFrameOffset-IAB, and \( x \) is the value used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \);
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationSOffset-IAB is configured, the subframe number \( s_{n} \) from Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-3 and the slot number \( s_{\mathrm{n}} \) from Table 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( \left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+\Delta s\right) \bmod L \) where \( \Delta s \in\{0,1, \ldots, L-1\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationSOffset-IAB, and \( L \) is the number of subframes in a frame when using Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-3 and the number of slots in a frame for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing when using in Table 6.3.3.2-4.

Random access preambles can only be transmitted in the frequency resources given by either the higher-layer parameter msg1-FrequencyStart or msgA-RO-FrequencyStart if configured as described in clause 8.1 of [5 TS 38.213]. The PRACH frequency resources \( n_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, M-1\} \), where \( M \) equals the higher-layer parameter msgl-FDM or msgA-RO-FDM if configured, are numbered in increasing order within the initial uplink bandwidth part during initial access, starting from the lowest frequency. Otherwise, \( n_{\mathrm{RA}} \) are numbered in increasing order within the active uplink bandwidth part, starting from the lowest frequency.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, for \( L_{R A}=139 \), a UE expects to be provided with higher-layer parameter msgl-FrequencyStart or msgA-RO-FrequencyStart if configured, and higher-layer parameter msgl-FDM or \( m s g A-R O-F D M \) if configured, such that a random-access preamble is confined within a single RB set. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in Clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214].

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, for \( L_{R A}=571 \) or 1151 and Type-2 random access, a UE expects to be provided with higher-layer parameter \( m s g A-R O-F D M \) equals to one.

For the purpose of slot numbering in the tables, the following subcarrier spacing shall be assumed:
- 15 kHz for FR1
- 60 kHz for FR2.

For handover purposes to a target cell in paired or unpaired spectrum where the target cell uses \( L_{\text {max }}=4 \), the UE may assume the absolute value of the time difference between radio frame \( i \) in the current cell and radio frame \( i \) in the target cell is less than \( 153600 T_{\mathrm{s}} \) if the association pattern period in clause 8.1 of [ 5 , TS 38.213] is not equal to 10 ms .

For inter frequency handover purposes where the source cell is either in paired or unpaired spectrum and the target cell is in unpaired spectrum and uses \( L_{\text {max }}=8 \), the UE may assume the absolute value of the time difference between radio frame \( i \) in the current cell and radio frame \( i \) in the target cell is less than \( 76800 T_{\mathrm{s}} \).

The intermediate quantity \( \tilde{a}_{k, l}^{\left(\tilde{p}_{j,} \mu\right)} \) shall be precoded, multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {PUSCH }}^{\text {DMRS }} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [6, TS 38.214], and mapped to physical resources according to

- the precoding matrix \( W \) is given by clause 6.3.1.5,
- the set of antenna ports \( \left\{p_{0, \ldots,} p_{p-1}\right\} \) is given by clause 6.3.1.5, and
- the set of antenna ports \( \left\{\tilde{p}_{0, \ldots,} \tilde{p}_{v-1}\right\} \) is given by [6, TS 38.214];
and the following conditions are fulfilled:
- the resource elements \( \tilde{a}_{k, l}^{\left(\tilde{p}_{j, \mu}\right)} \) are within the common resource blocks allocated for PUSCH transmission.

The reference point for \( k \) is
- Subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 if transform precoding is not enabled, and
- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block of the scheduled PUSCH allocation if transform precoding is enabled.

The reference point for \( l \) and the position \( l_{0} \) of the first DM-RS symbol depends on the mapping type:
- for PUSCH mapping type A:
- I is defined relative to the start of the slot if frequency hopping is disabled and relative to the start of each hop in case frequency hopping is enabled

- \( f_{0} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeA-Position
- for PUSCH mapping type B:
- \( I \) is defined relative to the start of the scheduled PUSCH resources if frequency hopping is disabled and relative to the start of each hop in case frequency hopping is enabled
- \( \ell_{0}=0 \)

The position(s) of the DM-RS symbols is given by \( \bar{l} \) and duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) where
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration between the first OFDM symbol of the slot and the last OFDM symbol of the scheduled PUSCH resources in the slot for PUSCH mapping type A according to Tables 6.4.1.1.3-3 and 6.4.1.1.3-4 if intraslot frequency hopping is not used, or
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration of scheduled PUSCH resources for PUSCH mapping type B according to Tables 6.4.1.1.3-3 and 6.4.1.1.3-4 if intra-slot frequency hopping is not used, or
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration per hop according to Table 6.4.1.1.3-6 if intra-slot frequency hopping is used.
- if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in DMRS-UplinkConfig is not configured, or for a msgA transmission msgA-MaxLength in msgA-DMRS-Config is not configured, the tables shall be used according to single-symbol DM-RS
- if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in DMRS-UplinkConfig is equal to 'len2', the associated DCI or configured grant configuration determines whether single-symbol or double-symbol DM-RS shall be used
- if the higher-layer parameter \( m s g A-M a x L e n g t h \) in \( m s g A-D M R S \)-Config is equal to 'len2', double-symbol DM-RS shall be used
- if the higher-layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition is not set to 'pos0' and intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled according to clause 7.3.1.1.2 in [4, TS 38.212] and by higher layer, Tables 6.4.1.1.3-6 shall be used assuming dmrs-AdditionalPosition is equal to 'posl' for each hop.

For PUSCH mapping type A,
- the case dmrs-AdditionalPosition is equal to 'pos3' is only supported when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=4 \) symbols in Table 6.4_1.1_3-4 is only applicable when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2'.

For msgA transmitted using PUSCH mapping type A,
- the case msgA-DMRS-AdditionalPosition is equal to 'pos3' is only supported when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- 'dmrs-AdditionalPosition' in Tables 6.4.1.1.3-3 to 6.4.1.1.3-6 shall be replaced by msgA-DMRSAdditionalPosition;
- only PUSCH DM-RS configuration type 1 is supported;
- only basic DM-RS multiplexing in Table 6.4.1.1.3-5 is supported.

For msgA transmitted using PUSCH mapping type B ,
- 'dmrs-AdditionalPosition' in Tables 6.4-1.1.3-3 to 6.4.1.1.3-6 shall be replaced by msgA-DMRSAdditionalPosition;
- only PUSCH DM-RS configuration type 1 is supported;
- only basic DM-RS multiplexing in Table 6.4.1.1.3-5 is supported.

The time-domain index \( l^{\prime} \), and the supported antenna ports \( \tilde{p}_{j} \) are given by Table 6.4.1.1.3-5.

If \( b_{\text {hop }}<B_{\text {SRS }} \), frequency hopping is enabled and the frequency position indices \( n_{b} \) are defined by
\[
n_{b}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\left\lfloor 4 n_{\mathrm{RRC}} / m_{\mathrm{SRS}, b}\right\rfloor \bmod N_{\mathrm{b}} & b \leq b_{\mathrm{hop}} \\
\left(F_{b}\left(n_{\mathrm{SRS}}\right)+\left\lfloor 4 n_{\mathrm{RRC}} / m_{\mathrm{SRS}, b}\right\rfloor\right) \bmod N_{\mathrm{b}} & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\]
where \( N_{\mathrm{b}} \) is given by Table 6.4.1.4.3-1,
\[
F_{b}\left(n_{\mathrm{SRS}}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\left(N_{b} / 2\right)\left\lfloor\frac{n_{\mathrm{SRS}} \bmod \Pi_{b=b_{\mathrm{ras}}}^{b} N_{b^{\prime}}}{\Pi_{b=b_{\mathrm{ras}}}^{b-1} N_{b}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n_{\mathrm{SRS}} \bmod \Pi_{b=b_{\mathrm{bon}}}^{b} N_{b}}{2 \Pi_{b=b_{\mathrm{ras}}}^{b-1} N_{b}}\right\rfloor & \text { if } N_{b} \text { even } \\
\left.\left\lfloor N_{b} / 2\right\rfloor n_{\mathrm{SRS}} / \Pi_{b=b_{\mathrm{ran}}}^{b-1} N_{b^{\prime}}\right\rfloor & \text { if } N_{b} \text { odd }
\end{array}\right.
\]
and where \( N_{b_{\text {hop }}}=1 \) regardless of the value of \( N_{\mathrm{b}} \). The quantity \( n_{\text {SRS }} \) counts the number of SRS transmissions. For the case of an SRS resource configured as aperiodic by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, it is given by \( n_{\text {SRS }}= \left[l^{\prime} /(s R)\right] \) within the slot in which the \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {SRS }} \) symbol SRS resource is transmitted. The quantity \( s \) is given by \( s=2 \) if the higher-layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports-n8 equals 'ports8tdm', otherwise \( s=1 \). The quantity \( R \leq N_{\text {symb }}^{\mathrm{SRS}} / s \) is the repetition factor given by the field repetition Factor if configured, otherwise \( R=N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {SRS }} \) -
For the case of an SRS resource configured as periodic or semi-persistent by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, the SRS counter is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{SRS}}=\left(\frac{N_{\mathrm{slot}}^{\mathrm{frame}, \mu} n_{\mathrm{f}}+n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu}-T_{\mathrm{offset}}}{T_{\mathrm{SRS}}}\right)\left(\frac{N_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\mathrm{SRS}}}{s R}\right)+\left\lfloor\frac{l^{\prime}}{s R}\right\rfloor
\]
for slots that satisfy ( \( N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {rame }, "} n_{\Gamma}+n_{s, \Gamma}^{\mu}-T_{o \Gamma l s e t} \) ) \( \bmod T_{\text {SRS }}=0 \). The periodicity \( T_{\text {SRS }} \) in slots and slot offset \( T_{\text {offset }} \) are given in clause 6.4.1.4.4.

6.4.1.4.4 Sounding reference signal slot configuration

Throughout this clause, when the higher layer parameter SRShoppingNrofHops is provided for SRS-PosResource, the sounding reference signal slot configuration applies to a given hop.

For an SRS resource configured as periodic or semi-persistent by the higher-layer parameter resourceType, a periodicity \( T_{\text {SRS }} \) (in slots) and slot offset \( T_{\text {offset }} \) are configured according to the higher-layer parameter periodicityAndOffset- \( p \) or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRS-Resource [E, or periodicityAndOffset-p or periodicityAndOffset-sp in the SRSPosResource IE. Candidate slots in which the configured SRS resource may be used for SRS transmission are the slots satisfying
\[
\left(N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu} n_{\mathrm{f}}+n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu}-T_{\text {offset }}\right) \bmod T_{\mathrm{SRS}}=0
\]
and, if the higher-layer parameter srs-PosHyperSFN-Index is configured for a periodicity larger than or equal to \( 2^{\mu} \). 10240 slots, also
\[
\left(n_{\mathrm{HFN}}+N_{\mathrm{SRS}}^{\mathrm{HFN}}\right) \bmod 2=0
\]
where \( N_{\mathrm{SRS}}^{\mathrm{HFN}} \in\{0,1\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter srs-PosHyperSFN-Index and \( n_{\mathrm{HFN}} \) is the hyper-frame number.

SRS is transmitted as described in clause 6.2.1 of [6, TS 38.214].
7 Downlink
7.1 Overview
7.1.1 Overview of physical channels

A downlink physical channel corresponds to a set of resource elements carrying information originating from higher layers. The following downlink physical channels are defined:
- Physical Downlink Shared Channel, PDSCH
- Physical Broadcast Channel, PBCH

3GPP TS 38.211 version 18.2.0 Release 18
118
ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05)
- Physical Downlink Control Channel, PDCCH.
7.1.2 Overview of physical signals

A downlink physical signal corresponds to a set of resource elements used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating from higher layers.

The following downlink physical signals are defined:
- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS
- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS
- Positioning reference signal, PRS
- Channel-state information reference signal, CSI-RS
- Primary synchronization signal, PSS
- Secondary synchronization signal, SSS
7.2 Physical resources

The frame structure and physical resources the UE shall assume when receiving downlink transmissions are defined in Clause 4.

The following antenna ports are defined for the downlink:
- Antenna ports starting with 1000 for PDSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH
- Antenna ports starting with 3000 for channel-state information reference signals
- Antenna ports starting with 4000 for SS/PBCH block transmission
- Antenna ports starting with 5000 for positioning reference signals

The UE shall not assume that two antenna ports are quasi co-located with respect to any QCL type unless specified otherwise.

For DM-RS associated with a PDSCH, the channel over which a PDSCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same resource as the scheduled PDSCH, in the same slot, and in the same PRG as described in clause 5.1.2.3 of [6, TS 38.214].

For DM-RS associated with a PDCCH, the channel over which a PDCCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within resources for which the UE may assume the same precoding being used as described in clause 7.3.2.2.

For DM-RS associated with a PBCH, the channel over which a PBCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within a SS/PBCH block transmitted within the same slot, and with the same block index according to clause 7.4.3.1.

7.3 Physical channels
7.3.1 Physical downlink shared channel
7.3.1.1 Scrambling

Up to two codewords \( q \in\{0,1\} \) can be transmitted. In case of single-codeword transmission, \( q=0 \).
For each codeword \( q \), the UE shall assume the block of bits \( b^{(q)}(0), \ldots, b^{(q)}\left(M_{\text {bit }}^{(q)}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\text {bit }}^{(q)} \) is the number of bits in codeword \( q \) transmitted on the physical channel, are scrambled prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}^{(q)}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}^{(q)}\left(M_{\text {bit }}^{(q)}-1\right) \) according to
\[
\tilde{b}^{(q)}(i)=\left(b^{(q)}(i)+c^{(q)}(i)\right) \bmod 2
\]
where the scrambling sequence \( c^{(q)}(i) \) is given by clause 5.2.1. The scrambling sequence generator shall be initialized with
\[
c_{\mathrm{init}}=n_{\mathrm{RNTI}} \cdot 2^{15}+q \cdot 2^{14}+n_{\mathrm{lD}}
\]
where
- \( n_{\mathrm{ID}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 1023\} \) equals the higher-layer parameter dataScramblingldentityPDSCH if configured and the RNTI equals the C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, and the transmission is not scheduled using DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) in a common search space;
- \( n_{\mathrm{ID}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 1023\} \) equals the higher-layer parameter dataScramblingldentityPDSCH if configured in a common MBS frequency resource and the RNTI equals the G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI, or multicast-MCCH-RNTI, and the transmission is scheduled using DCI in a common search space configured in the common MBS frequency resource;
- \( n_{\mathrm{ID}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 1023\} \) equals
- the higher-layer parameter dataScramblingldentityPDSCH if the codeword is scheduled using a CORESET with CORESETPoollndex equal to 0 ;
- the higher-layer parameter dataScramblingldentityPDSCH2 if the codeword is scheduled using a CORESET with CORESETPoollndex equal to 1 ;
if the higher-layer parameters dataScramblingldentityPDSCH and dataScramblingldentityPDSCH2 are configured together with the higher-layer parameter CORESETPoollndex containing two different values, and the RNTI equals the C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, and the transmission is not scheduled using DCI format 1_0 in a common search space;
- \( n_{\mathrm{ID}}=N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cell }} \) otherwise
and where \( n_{\text {RNTI }} \) corresponds to the RNTI associated with the PDSCH transmission as described in clause 5.1 of \( [6 \), TS 38.214].
7.3.1.2 Modulation

For each codeword \( q \), the UE shall assume the block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}^{(q)}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}^{(q)}\left(M_{\text {bit }}^{(q)}-1\right) \) are modulated as described in clause 5.1 using one of the modulation schemes in Table 7.3 .1.2-1, resulting in a block of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d^{(q)}(0), \ldots, d^{(q)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{(q)}-1\right) \).

Complex-valued modulation symbols \( d^{(q)}(0), \ldots, d^{(q)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{(q)}-\right. \) 1) for codeword \( q \) shall be mapped onto the layers \( x(i)=\left[x^{(0)}(i) \quad \ldots \quad x^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{\mathrm{T}}, i=0,1, \ldots, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }}-1 \) where \( v \) is the number of layers and \( M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }} \) is the number of modulation symbols per layer.

7.3.1.5 Mapping to virtual resource blocks

The UE shall, for each of the antenna ports used for transmission of the physical channel, assume the block of complexvalued symbols \( y^{(p)}(0), \ldots, y^{(p)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1\right) \) conform to the downlink power allocation specified in [6, TS 38.214] and are mapped in sequence starting with \( y^{(p)}(0) \) to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission which meet all of the following criteria:
- they are in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission;
- the corresponding physical resource blocks are declared as available for PDSCH according to clause 5.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214];
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are
- not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS or DM-RS intended for other co-scheduled UEs as described in clause 7.4.1.1.2;
- not used for non-zero-power CSI-RS, which is according to clause 7.4.1.5 and not configured by TRSResourceSet IE, if the corresponding physical resource blocks are for a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH with the CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI for multicast, G-CS-RNTI, or a PDSCH with SPS, except if the non-zero-power CSI-RS is a CSI-RS configured by the higher-layer parameter CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility in the MeasObjectNR IE or except if the non-zero-power CSI-RS is an aperiodic non-zero-power CSI-RS resource;
- not used for PT-RS according to clause 7.4.1.2;
- not declared as 'not available for PDSCH according to clause 5.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214].

The mapping to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) allocated for PDSCH according to [6, TS 38.214] and not reserved for other purposes shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks, where \( k^{\prime}=0 \) is the first subcarrier in the lowest-numbered virtual resource block assigned for transmission, and then the index \( l \).
7.3.1.6 Mapping from virtual to physical resource blocks

The UE shall assume the virtual resource blocks are mapped to physical resource blocks according to the indicated mapping scheme, non-interleaved or interleaved mapping. If no mapping scheme is indicated, the UE shall assume noninterleaved mapping.

For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n \), except for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) in a common search space in which case virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n+N_{\text {start }}^{\text {COREST }} \) where \( N_{\text {start }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) is the lowest-numbered physical resource block in the control resource set where the corresponding DCI was received. When two PDCCH candidates from two linked common search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked common search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine \( N_{\text {start }}^{\text {CORESET }} \).

For interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, the mapping process is defined by:
- Resource block bundles are defined as

A control-resource set consists of \( N_{\text {RB }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) resource blocks in the frequency domain and \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {CORESET }} \in\{1,2,3\} \) symbols in the time domain.

A control-channel element consists of 6 resource-element groups (REGs) where a resource-element group equals one resource block during one OFDM symbol. Resource-element groups within a control-resource set are numbered in increasing order in a time-first manner, starting with 0 for the first OFDM symbol and the lowest-numbered resource block in the control resource set.

A UE can be configured with multiple control-resource sets. Each control-resource set is associated with one CCE-toREG mapping only.

The CCE-to-REG mapping for a control-resource set can be interleaved or non-interleaved and is described by REG bundles:
- REG bundle \( i \) is defined as REGs \( \{i L, i L+1, \ldots, i L+L-1\} \) where \( L \) is the REG bundle size, \( i= 0,1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{REG}}^{\text {CORESET }} / L-1 \), and \( N_{\mathrm{REG}}^{\text {CORESET }}=N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {CORESET }} N_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\text {CORESET }} \) is the number of REGs in the CORESET
- CCE \( j \) consists of REG bundles \( \{f(6 j / L), f(6 j / L+1), \ldots, f(6 j / L+6 / L-1)\} \) where \( f(\cdot) \) is an interleaver

7.4.1.1.2 Mapping to physical resources

The UE shall assume the PDSCH DM-RS being mapped to physical resources according to configuration type 1 or configuration type 2 as given by the higher-layer parameter dmrs-Type.

The UE shall assume the sequence \( r(m) \) is scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\text {PDSCH }}^{\text {DMRS }} \) to conform with the transmission power specified in [6, TS 38.214] and mapped to resource elements ( \( k, l)_{p, \mu} \) according to
- if the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeEnh is configured
\[
\begin{array}{l} 
\tilde{a}_{k, l}^{\left(p_{j, l}\right)}=\beta_{\mathrm{PDSCH}}^{\mathrm{DMRS}} w_{\mathrm{f}}\left(k^{\prime}\right) w_{\mathrm{t}}\left(l^{\prime}\right) r\left(4 n+k^{\prime}\right) \\
k=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
8 n+2 k^{\prime}+\Delta & \text { configuration type 1 } \\

k^{\prime}=0,1,2,3 \\
l=\bar{l}+l^{\prime} \\
n=0,1, \ldots \\
j=0,1, \ldots, v-1

- otherwise
\[
\tilde{a}_{k, l}^{\left(p_{j}, \mu\right)}=\beta_{\mathrm{PDSCH}}^{\mathrm{DMRS}} w_{\mathrm{f}}\left(k^{\prime}\right) w_{\mathrm{t}}\left(l^{\prime}\right) r\left(2 n+k^{\prime}\right)

where \( w_{\mathrm{f}}\left(k^{\prime}\right), w_{\mathrm{t}}\left(l^{\prime}\right) \), and \( \Delta \) are given by Tables 7.4.1.1.2-1 and 7.4.1.1.2-2 and the following conditions are fulfilled:
- the resource elements are within the common resource blocks allocated for PDSCH transmission

The reference point for \( k \) is
- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI;
- otherwise, subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0

The reference point for \( l \) and the position \( l_{0} \) of the first DM-RS symbol depends on the mapping type:
- for PDSCH mapping type A:
- \( l \) is defined relative to the start of the slot
- \( l_{0}=3 \) if the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos3' and \( l_{0}=2 \) otherwise
- for PDSCH mapping type B:
- \( l \) is defined relative to the start of the scheduled PDSCH resources
\( -l_{0}=0 \)
The position(s) of the DM-RS symbols is given by \( \bar{l} \) and duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) where
- for PDSCH mapping type \( \mathrm{A}, l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration between the first OFDM symbol of the slot and the last OFDM symbol of the scheduled PDSCH resources in the slot
- for PDSCH mapping type \( \mathrm{B}, l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration of the scheduled PDSCH resources
and according to Tables 7.4.1.1.2-3 and 7.4.1.1.2-4.
For PDSCH mapping type A
- the case dmrs-AdditionalPosition equals to 'pos3' is only supported when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=3 \) and \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=4 \) symbols in Tables 7.4.1.1.2-3 and 7.4.1.1.2-4 respectively is only applicable when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- single-symbol DM-RS, \( l_{1}=11 \) except if all of the following conditions are fulfilled in which case \( l_{1}=12 \) :
- the higher-layer parameter lte-CRS-ToMatchAround, lte-CRS-PatternList 1, lte-CRS-PatternList2, lte-CRSPatternList3, or Ite-CRS-PatternList4 is configured; and
- the higher-layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition is equal to 'pos1' and \( l_{0}=3 \); and
- the UE has indicated it is capable of additionalDMRS-DL-Alt

For PDSCH mapping type B
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\} \) OFDM symbols for normal cyclic prefix or \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in \{2,4,6\} \) OFDM symbols for extended cyclic prefix, and the front-loaded DM-RS of the PDSCH allocation collides with resources reserved for a search space set associated with a CORESET, \( \bar{l} \) shall be incremented such that the first DM-RS symbol occurs immediately after the CORESET and until no collision with any CORESET occurs, and

- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 2 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive a DM-RS symbol beyond the second symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 5 symbols and if one additional single-symbol DMRS is configured, the UE only expects the additional DM-RS to be transmitted on the 5th symbol when the front-loaded DM-RS symbol is in the 1st symbol of the PDSCH duration, otherwise the UE should expect that the additional DM-RS is not transmitted;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 7 symbols for normal cyclic prefix or 6 symbols for extended cyclic prefix:
- if one additional single-symbol DM-RS is configured, the UE only expects the additional DM-RS to be transmitted on the 5th or 6th symbol when the front-loaded DM-RS symbol is in the 1st or 2nd symbol, respectively, of the PDSCH duration, otherwise the UE should expect that the additional DM-RS is not transmitted;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in\{5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\} \) OFDM symbols, the UE is not expected to receive the front-loaded DM-RS beyond the 4th symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 12 or 13 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive DM-RS mapped to symbol 12 or later in the slot;
- for all values of the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) other than 2,5 , and 7 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive DM-RS beyond the ( \( l_{\mathrm{d}}-1 \) ):th symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is less than or equal to 4 OFDM symbols, only single-symbol DM-RS is supported.
- if the higher-layer parameter ite-CRS-ToMatchAround, ite-CRS-PatternList 1, lte-CRS-PatternList2, ite-CRSPatternList3, or lte-CRS-PatternList4 is configured, the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=10 \) symbols for normal cyclic prefix, the subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu=0 \), single-symbol DM-RS is configured, and at least one PDSCH DM-RS symbol in the PDSCH allocation collides with a symbol containing resource elements as indicated by the higher-layer parameter ite-CRS-ToMatchAround, ite-CRS-PatternList 1, ite-CRS-PatternList2, ite-CRSPatternList3, or lte-CRS-PatternList4, then \( \bar{l} \) shall be incremented by one in all slots.

The time-domain index \( l^{\prime} \) and the supported antenna ports \( p \) are given by Table 7.4.1.1.2-5 where
- single-symbol DM-RS is used if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in the DMRS-DownlinkConfig IE is not configured;
- single-symbol or double-symbol DM-RS is determined by the associated DCI if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in the DMRS-DownlinkConfig IE is equal to 'len2';
- basic or enhanced DM-RS multiplexing is controlled by the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeEnh.

In absence of CSI-RS configuration, and unless otherwise configured, the UE may assume PDSCH DM-RS and SS/PBCH block to be quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters. Unless specified otherwise, the UE may assume that the PDSCH DM-RS within the same CDM group are quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and spatial Rx (when applicable). The UE may assume that DMRS ports associated with a TCI state as described in clause 5.1.6.2 of [6, TS 38.214] of a PDSCH are QCL with QCL Type A, Type D (when applicable) and average gain.

The UE may assume that no DM-RS collides with the SS/PBCH block.

7.4.1.2 Phase-tracking reference signals for PDSCH
7.4.1.2.1 Sequence generation

The phase-tracking reference signal for subcarrier \( k \) is given by
- If the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeEnh is configured
\[
r_{k}=r\left(4 m+k^{\prime}\right)
\]
- otherwise
\[
r_{k}=r\left(2 m+k^{\prime}\right)
\]
where \( r(\cdot) \) is the demodulation reference signal given by clause 7.4.1.1.2 at position \( l_{0} \) and subcarrier \( k \).
7.4.1.2.2 Mapping to physical resources

The UE shall assume phase-tracking reference signals being present only in the resource blocks used for the PDSCH, and only if the procedure in [6, TS 38.214] indicates phase-tracking reference signals being used.

If present, the UE shall assume the PDSCH PT-RS is scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\mathrm{PT}-\mathrm{RS}, i} \) to conform with the transmission power specified in clause 4.1 of \( \left[6\right. \), TS 38.214] and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) according to
\[
a_{k, l}^{(p, \mu)}=\beta_{\mathrm{PT}-\mathrm{RS}, i} r_{k}
\]

The reference point for \( k=0 \) is subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 .
The value of \( \rho \) is given by the higher-layer parameter density in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E or the CSI-RSCellMobility I \( E \) and the number of ports \( X \) is given by the higher-layer parameter nrofPorts. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRS-ResourceSet [E, the density \( \rho=3 \) and number of ports \( X=1 \).

The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and DM-RS on the same resource elements.
The UE shall assume \( \beta_{\text {CSIRS }}>0 \) for a non-zero-power CSI-RS where \( \beta_{\text {CSIRS }} \) is selected such that the power offset specified by the higher-layer parameter powerControlOffsetSS in the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or in the TRSResourceSet [E, if provided, is fulfilled.

The indices \( k^{\prime} \) and \( l^{\prime} \) index resource elements within a CDM group.

The time-domain locations \( l_{0} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 13\} \) and \( l_{1} \in\{2,3, \ldots, 12\} \) are provided by the higher-layer parameters firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain and firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain2, respectively, in the CSI-RSResourceMapping IE or the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility IE and defined relative to the start of a slot.

The starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted are given by the higher-layer parameters freqBand and density in the CSI-RSResourceMapping [E for the bandwidth part given by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig IE or given by the higher-layer parameters nrofPRBs in the CSI-RS-CellMobility [E where the the startPRB given by csi\( r s \)-Measurement \( B W \) is relative to common resource block 0 . For NZP CSI-RS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the CSI-RS can be transmitted are given by the higherlayer parameters nrofRBs, and startingRB in the TRS-ResourceSet [E, where startingRB is relative to common resource block 0 and the density \( \rho=3 \).

The UE shall assume that a CSI-RS is transmitted using antenna ports \( p \) numbered according to

The CDM group index \( j \) given in Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to the time/frequency locations \( (\bar{k}, \bar{l}) \) for a given row of the table.

7.4.1.7.3 Mapping to physical resources in a downlink PRS resource

For each downlink PRS resource configured, the UE shall assume the sequence \( r(m) \) is scaled with a factor \( \beta_{\text {PRS }} \) and mapped to resources elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) according to
\[

l & =l_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{PRS}}, l_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{PRS}}+1, \ldots, l_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{PRS}}+L_{\mathrm{PRS}}-1

\]

Mapping to physical resources is described in clause 7.4.3.
7.4.3 SS/PBCH block
7.4.3.1 Time-frequency structure of an SS/PBCH block

In the time domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 4 OFDM symbols, numbered in increasing order from 0 to 3 within the SS/PBCH block, where PSS, SSS, and PBCH with associated DM-RS are mapped to symbols as given by Table 7.4.3.1-1.

In the frequency domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 240 contiguous subcarriers with the subcarriers numbered in increasing order from 0 to 239 within the SS/PBCH block. The quantities \( k \) and \( l \) represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block. The UE may assume that the complex-valued symbols corresponding to resource elements denoted as 'Set to 0 ' in Table 7.4.3.1-1 are set to zero. The quantity \( v \) in Table 7.4.3.1-1 is given by \( v=N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cell }} \bmod 4 \). The quantity \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is the subcarrier offset from subcarrier 0 in common resource block \( N_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\text {SSB }} \) to the lowest-numbered subcarrier of the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, where \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) is obtained from the higher-layer parameter offsetToPointA.
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and for operation without shared spectrum channel access, the 4 least significant bits of \( k_{\text {SSB }} \) are given by the higher-layer parameter ssb-SubcarrierOffset and for FR1 the most significant bit of \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is given by \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+5} \) in the PBCH payload as defined in clause 7.1 -1 of \( [4, \mathrm{TS} \) 38.212].
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, the 4 least significant bits of \( \bar{k}_{\text {SSB }} \) are given by the higher-layer parameter ssb-SubcarrierOffset and the most significant bit of \( \bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is given by \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+5} \) in the PBCH payload as defined in clause 7.1 . 1 of [ \( 4, \mathrm{TS} 38.212 \) ]. If \( \bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \geq 24, k_{\mathrm{SSB}}=\bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \); otherwise, \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}}=2\left\lfloor\bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} / 2\right\rfloor \).

If ssb-SubcarrierOffset is not provided, \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is derived from the frequency difference between the SS/PBCH block and Point A.

The UE may assume that the complex-valued symbols corresponding to resource elements that are part of a common resource block partially or fully overlapping with an SS/PBCH block, or an SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, and not used for SS/PBCH transmission are set to zero in the OFDM symbols partially or fully overlapping with OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH is transmitted.

For an SS/PBCH block, the UE shall assume
- antenna port \( p=4000 \) is used for transmission of PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH,
- the same cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing for the PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH,

- for SS/PBCH block type B in FR2-1, \( \mu \in\{3,4\} \) and \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \in\{0,1,2, \ldots, 11\} \) with the quantity \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) expressed in terms of the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher-layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon and \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of 60 kHz subcarrier spacing;
- for SS/PBCH block type B in FR2-2, \( \mu \in\{3,5,6\} \) and \( k_{\text {SSB }} \in\{0,1,2, \ldots, 11\} \) with the quantity \( k_{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of the SS/PBCH block subcarrier spacing and \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of 60 kHz subcarrier spacing;
- the centre of subcarrier 0 of resource block \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) coincides with the centre of subcarrier 0 of a common resource block with the subcarrier spacing
- provided by the higher-layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1; and
- same as the subcarrier spacing of the SS/PBCH block for operation without shared spectrum access in FR2-2 and for operation with shared spectrum channel access.
- This common resource block overlaps with subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block of the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable.

The UE may assume that SS/PBCH blocks transmitted with the same block index on the same center frequency location are quasi co-located with respect to Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters. The UE shall not assume quasi co-location for any other SS/PBCH block transmissions other than what is specified in [5, TS 38.213].

For cell search on a carrier with a channel bandwidth of 3 MHz , the UE is not expected to receive subcarriers 0 to 47 and 192 to 239 in any of the 4 OFDM symbols of the SS/PBCH block, where the remaining 12 resource blocks form the SS/PBCH block after puncturing.

8.2.1 General

In a shared SL PRS resource pool, the OFDM symbol immediately preceding the symbols which are configured for use by PSFCH if PSFCH is configured in this slot, and the last symbol configured for sidelink in a slot, serve as guard symbol(s). In a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, the last symbol configured for sidelink in a slot serves as a guard symbol. Otherwise, the OFDM symbol immediately following the last symbol used for PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SSB serves as a guard symbol.

The first OFDM symbol of a PSSCH and its associated PSCCH is duplicated as described in clauses 8.3.1.5 and 8.3.2.3. The first OFDM symbol of a PSFCH is duplicated as described in clause 8.3.4.2.2.

The OFDM symbol immediately preceding an SL PRS transmission in a dedicated SL PRS resource pool is generated as described in clause 8.4.1.6.3.
8.2.2 Numerologies

Multiple OFDM numerologies are supported as given by Table 8.2.2-1 where \( \mu \) and the cyclic prefix for a sidelink bandwidth part are obtained from the higher-layer parameter \( s l-B W P \).

For DM-RS associated with a PSCCH, the channel over which a PSCCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same frequency resource as the transmitted PSCCH and in the same slot.
8.2.5 Resource grid

The resource grid for sidelink transmission is defined in clause 4.4.2.
For sidelink, the carrier bandwidth \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {size }, \mu} \) and the starting position \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) are obtained from the higher-layer parameter \( s l \)-SCS-SpecificCarrierList.

For the sidelink, the higher-layer parameter sl-TxDirectCurrentLocation indicates the location of the transmitter DC subcarrier in the sidelink for each of the configured bandwidth parts. Values in the range \( 0-3299 \) represent the number of the DC subcarrier, the value 3300 indicates that the DC subcarrier is located outside the resource grid, and the value 3301 indicates that the position of the DC subcarrier in the sidelink is undetermined. The DC subcarrier location offset relative to the center of the indicated subcarrier is given by \( 7.5+5 N \mathrm{kHz} \) if frequencyShift \( 7 p 5 k h z S L \) is provided and by \( 5 N \mathrm{kHz} \) otherwise, where \( N \in\{-1,0,1\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter value \( N \).
8.2.6 Resource elements

Resource elements are defined in clause 4.4.3.
8.2.7 Resource blocks

Resource blocks are defined in clause 4.4.4.
Point A for sidelink transmission/reception is obtained from the higher-layer parameter s \( l \)-AbsoluteFrequencyPointA.
