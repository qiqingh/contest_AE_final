Data field corresponds. The first byte of the original RLC SDU is referred by the SO field value " 0000000000000000 ", i.e., numbering starts at zero.
6.2.3.6 Data/Control (D/C) field

Length: 1 bit.
The D/C field indicates whether the RLC PDU is an RLC data PDU or RLC control PDU. The interpretation of the D/C field is provided in Table 6.2.3.6-1.

\begin{table}

\caption{Table 6.2.3.6-1: D/C field interpretation}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline Value & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Description } \\
\hline 0 & Control PDU \\
\hline 1 & Data PDU \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.2.3.7 Polling bit (P) field

Length: 1 bit.
The \( P \) field indicates whether or not the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity requests a STATUS report from its peer AM RLC entity. The interpretation of the P field is provided in Table 6.2.3.7-1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.2.3.7-1: P field interpretation}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline Value & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Description } \\
\hline 0 & Status report not requested \\
\hline 1 & Status report is requested \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.2.3.8 Reserved (R) field

Length: 1 bit.
The R field is a reserved field for this release of the protocol. The transmitting entity shall set the R field to " 0 ". The receiving entity shall ignore this field.
6.2.3.9 Control PDU Type (CPT) field

Length: 3 bits.
The CPT field indicates the type of the RLC control PDU. The interpretation of the CPT field is provided in Table 6.2.3.9-1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.2.3.9-1: CPT field interpretation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Value & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Description } \\
\hline 000 & STATUS PDU \\
\hline \( 001- \) & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Reserved \\
(PDUs with this coding will be discarded by the receiving entity for this release of the \\
protocol)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.2.3.10 Acknowledgement SN (ACK_SN) field

Length: 12 bits or 18 bits (configurable).
The ACK_SN field indicates the SN of the next not received RLC SDU which is not reported as missing in the STATUS PDU. When the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity receives a STATUS PDU, it interprets that all RLC SDUs up to but not including the RLC SDU with SN = ACK_SN have been received by its peer AM RLC entity, excluding those RLC SDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NACK_SN, portions of RLC SDUs indicated in the
