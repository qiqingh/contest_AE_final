6.2.2.4 AMD PDU

AMD PDU consists of a Data field and an AMD PDU header. The AMD PDU header is byte aligned.
An AM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 12 bit SN or a 18 bit SN. The length of the AMD PDU header is two and three bytes respectively.

An AMD PDU header contains a D/C, a P, a SI, and a SN. An AMD PDU header contains the SO field only when the Data field consists of an RLC SDU segment which is not the first segment, in which case a 16 bit SO is present.
