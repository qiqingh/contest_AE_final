Figure 4.2.1.2.1-1: Model of two unacknowledged mode peer entities

An UM RLC entity submits/receives the following RLC data PDU:
- UMD PDU.

An UMD PDU contains either one complete RLC SDU or one RLC SDU segment.
NOTE: For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication only uni-directional UM mode is supported.
4.2.1.2.2 Transmitting UM RLC entity

The transmitting UM RLC entity generates UMD PDU(s) for each RLC SDU. It shall include relevant RLC headers in the UMD PDU. When notified of a transmission opportunity by the lower layer, the transmitting UM RLC entity shall segment the RLC SDUs, if needed, so that the corresponding UMD PDUs, with RLC headers updated as needed, fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer.
4.2.1.2.3 Receiving UM RLC entity

When a receiving UM RLC entity receives UMD PDUs, it shall:
- detect the loss of RLC SDU segments at lower layers;
- reassemble RLC SDUs from the received UMD PDUs and deliver the RLC SDUs to upper layer as soon as they are available;
- discard received UMD PDUs that cannot be re-assembled into an RLC SDU due to loss at lower layers of an UMD PDU which belonged to the particular RLC SDU.
4.2.1.3 AM RLC entity
4.2.1.3.1 General

An AM RLC entity can be configured to submit/receive RLC PDUs through the following logical channels:
