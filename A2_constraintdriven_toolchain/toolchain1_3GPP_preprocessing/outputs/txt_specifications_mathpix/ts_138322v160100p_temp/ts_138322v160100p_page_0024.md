rightmost bit of the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines.

RLC SDUs are bit strings that are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. An RLC SDU is included into an RLC PDU from first bit onward.
6.2.2.2 TMD PDU

TMD PDU consists only of a Data field and does not consist of any RLC headers.

Figure 6.2.2.2-1: TMD PDU
6.2.2.3 UMD PDU

UMD PDU consists of a Data field and an UMD PDU header. The UMD PDU header is byte aligned.
When an UMD PDU contains a complete RLC SDU, the UMD PDU header only contains the SI and R fields.
An UM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 6 bit SN or a 12 bit SN. For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication, only 6 bit SN length is configured. An UMD PDU header contains the SN field only when the corresponding RLC SDU is segmented. An UMD PDU carrying the first segment of an RLC SDU does not carry the SO field in its header. The length of the SO field is 16 bits.
