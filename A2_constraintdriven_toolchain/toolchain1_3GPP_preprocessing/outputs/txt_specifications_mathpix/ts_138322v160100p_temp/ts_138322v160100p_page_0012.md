An AM RLC entity delivers/receives the following RLC data PDUs:
- AMD PDU.

An AMD PDU contains either one complete RLC SDU or one RLC SDU segment.
An AM RLC entity delivers/receives the following RLC control PDU:
- STATUS PDU.
4.2.1.3.2 Transmitting side

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity generates AMD PDU(s) for each RLC SDU. When notified of a transmission opportunity by the lower layer, the transmitting AM RLC entity shall segment the RLC SDUs, if needed, so that the corresponding AMD PDUs, with RLC headers updated as needed, fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity supports retransmission of RLC SDUs or RLC SDU segments (ARQ):
- if the RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment to be retransmitted (including the RLC header) does not fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity notified by lower layer, the AM RLC entity can segment the RLC SDU or re-segment the RLC SDU segments into RLC SDU segments;
- the number of re-segmentation is not limited.

When the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity forms AMD PDUs from RLC SDUs or RLC SDU segments, it shall:
