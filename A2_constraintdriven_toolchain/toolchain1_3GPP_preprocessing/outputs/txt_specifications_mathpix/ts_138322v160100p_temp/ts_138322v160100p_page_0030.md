STATUS PDU with NACK_SN, SOstart and SOend, RLC SDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NACK_SN and NACK_range, and portions of RLC SDUs indicated in the STATUS PDU with NACK_SN, NACK range, SOstart and SOend.
6.2.3.11 Extension bit 1 (E1) field

Length: 1 bit.
The E1 field indicates whether or not a set of NACK_SN, E1, E2 and E3 follows. The interpretation of the E1 field is provided in Table 6.2.3.11-1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.2.3.11-1: E1 field interpretation}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline Value & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Description } \\
\hline 0 & A set of NACK_SN, E1, E2 and E3 does not follow. \\
\hline 1 & A set of NACK_SN, E1, E2 and E3 follows. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.2.3.12 Negative Acknowledgement SN (NACK_SN) field

Length: 12 bits or 18 bits (configurable).
The NACK_SN field indicates the SN of the RLC SDU (or RLC SDU segment) that has been detected as lost at the receiving side of the AM RLC entity.
6.2.3.13 Extension bit 2 (E2) field

Length: 1 bit.
The E2 field indicates whether or not a set of SOstart and SOend follows. The interpretation of the E2 field is provided in Table 6.2.3.13-1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.2.3.13-1: E2 field interpretation}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline Value & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Description } \\
\hline 0 & A set of SOstart and SOend does not follow for this NACK_SN. \\
\hline 1 & A set of SOstart and SOend follows for this NACK_SN. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
6.2.3.14 SO start (SOstart) field

Length: 16 bits.
The SOstart field (together with the SOend field) indicates the portion of the RLC SDU with SN = NACK_SN (the NACK_SN for which the SOstart is related to) that has been detected as lost at the receiving side of the AM RLC entity. Specifically, the SOstart field indicates the position of the first byte of the portion of the RLC SDU in bytes within the original RLC SDU. The first byte of the original RLC SDU is referred by the SOstart field value " 0000000000000000 ", i.e., numbering starts at zero.
6.2.3.15 SO end (SOend) field

Length: 16 bits.
When E3 is 0 , the SOend field (together with the SOstart field) indicates the portion of the RLC SDU with SN = NACK_SN (the NACK_SN for which the SOend is related to) that has been detected as lost at the receiving side of the AM RLC entity. Specifically, the SOend field indicates the position of the last byte of the portion of the RLC SDU in bytes within the original RLC SDU. The first byte of the original RLC SDU is referred by the SOend field value " 0000000000000000 ", i.e., numbering starts at zero. The special SOend value " 1111111111111111 " is used to indicate that the missing portion of the RLC SDU includes all bytes to the last byte of the RLC SDU.

When E3 is 1 , the SOend field indicates the portion of the RLC SDU with SN \( = \) NACK_SN + NACK range -1 that has been detected as lost at the receiving side of the AM RLC entity. Specifically, the SOend field indicates the position of
