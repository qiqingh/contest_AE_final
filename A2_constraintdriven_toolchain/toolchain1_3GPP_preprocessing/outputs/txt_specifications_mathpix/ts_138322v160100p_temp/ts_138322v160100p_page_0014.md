5 Procedures
5.1 RLC entity handling
5.1.1 RLC entity establishment

When upper layers request an RLC entity establishment, the UE shall:
- establish a RLC entity;
- set the state variables of the RLC entity to initial values;
- follow the procedures in clause 5.2.

For NR sidelink groupcast and broadcast, when receiving the first UMD PDU from a Source Layer 2 ID and Destination Layer 2 ID pair for an LCID, and there is not yet a corresponding receiving RLC entity for a radio bearer, the UE shall:
- establish a receiving RLC entity;
- set the state variables of the RLC entity to initial values;
- follow the procedures in clause 5.2.
5.1.2 RLC entity re-establishment

When upper layers request an RLC entity re-establishment, the UE shall:
- discard all RLC SDUs, RLC SDU segments, and RLC PDUs, if any;
- stop and reset all timers;
- reset all state variables to their initial values.
5.1.3 RLC entity release

When upper layers request an RLC entity release, the UE shall:
- discard all RLC SDUs, RLC SDU segments, and RLC PDUs, if any;
- release the RLC entity.

NOTE: For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication, the receiving UM RLC entity release is up to UE implementation.
5.2 Data transfer procedures
5.2.1 TM data transfer
5.2.1.1 Transmit operations
