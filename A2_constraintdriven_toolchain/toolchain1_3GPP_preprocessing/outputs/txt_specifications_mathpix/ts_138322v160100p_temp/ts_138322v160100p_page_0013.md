- include relevant RLC headers in the AMD PDU.
4.2.1.3.3 Receiving side

When the receiving side of an AM RLC entity receives AMD PDUs, it shall:
- detect whether or not the AMD PDUs have been received in duplication, and discard duplicated AMD PDUs;
- detect the loss of AMD PDUs at lower layers and request retransmissions to its peer AM RLC entity;
- reassemble RLC SDUs from the received AMD PDUs and deliver the RLC SDUs to upper layer as soon as they are available.
4.3 Services
4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers

The following services are provided by RLC to upper layer:
- TM data transfer;
- UM data transfer;
- AM data transfer, including indication of successful delivery of upper layers PDUs.
4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers

The following services are expected by RLC from lower layer (i.e. MAC):
- data transfer;
- notification of a transmission opportunity, together with the total size of the RLC PDU(s) to be transmitted in the transmission opportunity.
4.4 Functions

The following functions are supported by the RLC sub layer:
- transfer of upper layer PDUs;
- error correction through ARQ (only for AM data transfer);
- segmentation and reassembly of RLC SDUs (only for UM and AM data transfer);
- re-segmentation of RLC SDU segments (only for AM data transfer);
- duplicate detection (only for AM data transfer);
- RLC SDU discard (only for UM and AM data transfer);
- RLC re-establishment;
- Protocol error detection (only for AM data transfer).
