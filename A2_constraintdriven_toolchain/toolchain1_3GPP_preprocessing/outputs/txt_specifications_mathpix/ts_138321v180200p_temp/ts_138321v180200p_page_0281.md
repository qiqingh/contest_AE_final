resources. This bit is set to 1 when multiplexing mode information contained in the two rightmost bits of the Multiplexing mode info \( \left[D_{11}\right. \) field is applicable to non-overlapping frequency resources. This field is set to 0 when multiplexing mode information contained in the two rightmost bits of the Multiplexing mode info ID, field is not applicable to non-overlapping frequency resources. The remaining 5 bits of this field are set to zero. The length of the field is 8 bits.
