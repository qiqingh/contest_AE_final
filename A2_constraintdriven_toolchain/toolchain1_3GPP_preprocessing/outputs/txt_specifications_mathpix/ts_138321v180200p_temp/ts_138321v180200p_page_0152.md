\( 5> \) if transmission based on full sensing or partial sensing is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resources indicated by the physical layer according to clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for more transmission opportunities; or
\( 5> \) if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resource pool for more transmission opportunities:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources excluding all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled and the resources of which the lowest sub-channel includes intra cell guard band PRBs if sl-transmissionStructureForPSCCHandPSSCH is set to 'contiguousRB' are excluded, if configured according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE has own sensing result as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE:
\( 5> \) if there are available resources left in the intersection of the received preferred resource set and the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for more transmission opportunities:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources within the intersection for SL-SCH data to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 5> \) if the number of time and frequency resources that has been maximally selected for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources within the intersection is smaller than the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and there are available resources left in the resources indicated by the physical layer for more transmission opportunities:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for the remaining transmission opportunities except for the selected resources within the intersection from the available resources outside the intersection but left in the resources indicated by the physical layer according to clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE does not have own sensing result as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE; and

4> if there are available resources left in the received preferred resource set for more transmission opportunities:

5> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources belonging to the received preferred resource set for SL-SCH data to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions, the remaining PDB of SL
