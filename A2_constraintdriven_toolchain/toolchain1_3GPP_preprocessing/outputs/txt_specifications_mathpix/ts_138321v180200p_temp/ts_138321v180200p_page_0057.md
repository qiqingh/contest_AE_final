3> not perform any uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.
\( 2> \) else:
3> flush all HARQ buffers;
3> not perform any uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.
NOTE: The MAC entity suspends all UL operations (e.g. stop RACH, SR, and UL HARQ operation) after receiving the indication of an uplink synchronization loss and resumes the operation when receiving an indication of uplink synchronization.
5.3 DL-SCH data transfer
5.3.1 DL Assignment reception

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors PDCCH and for each Serving Cell:

1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, or Temporary C-RNTI, or G-RNTI configured for multicast MTCH:

2 if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:
\( 3> \) consider the NDI to have been toggled.
\( 2> \) if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, and if the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or a configured downlink assignment for unicast or MBS multicast; or
\( 2> \) if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity's G-RNTI configured for multicast MTCH, and if the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or other G-RNTI, or C-RNTI, or a configured downlink assignment for unicast or MBS multicast:
\( 3> \) consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the NDI.
\( 2> \) stop the cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer, if it is running, for the corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;
\( 2> \) stop the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer, if it is running, for the corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission of RACH-less handover or for the first PUSCH transmission at RACH-less LTM cell switch;
\( 2> \) stop the configuredGrantTimer, if it is running, for the corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;
\( 2> \) if the downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's C-RNTI after the first PUSCH transmission to the Serving Cell; and
\( 2> \) if the downlink assignment is for a new transmission:
\( 3> \) if there is an ongoing RACH-less handover procedure:
\( 4> \) consider the RACH-less handover to be successfully completed and indicate it to upper layers.
\( 3> \) else if there is an ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch:
4> consider the LTM cell switch to be successfully completed and indicate it to upper layers.
\( 2> \) indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
