6.1.3.43 Enhanced BFR MAC CEs

The Enhanced MAC CEs for BFR consists of either:
- Enhanced BFR MAC CE; or
- Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE.

The Enhanced BFR MAC CE and Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE are identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID/LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2 and Table 6.2.1-2b.

The Enhanced BFR MAC CE and Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE have a variable size. They include an SP field, \( C_{1} \) bitmap (single octet or four octets), \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap ( 0 to 4 octets), beam failure recovery information i.e octets containing candidate beam availability indication (AC) for BFD-RS set(s) of SpCell configured with two BFD-RS sets, and in ascending order based on ServCellIndex, beam failure recovery information i.e. octets containing candidate beam availability indication (AC) for SCells or BFD-RS set(s) of SCells configured with two BFD-RS sets indicated in the C, bitmap. For Enhanced BFR MAC CE, a single octet \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap is used when the highest ServCellIndex of this MAC entity's SCell for which beam failure is detected for SCell or for at least one BFD-RS set of SCell and the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed is less than 8, otherwise four octets \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap is used. A MAC PDU shall contain at most one MAC CE for BFR.

For Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE, a single octet \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap is used for the following cases, otherwise four octets \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap is used:
- the highest ServCellIndex of this MAC entity's SCell for which beam failure is detected for SCell or for at least one BFD-RS set of SCell and the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed is less than 8 ; or
- beam failure is detected for SpCell (as specified in Clause 5.17) not configured with two BFD-RS sets, and the SpCell is to be indicated in a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE and the UL-SCH resources available for transmission cannot accommodate the Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE with the four octets \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap plus its subheader as a result of LCP; or
- Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure recovery of both BFD-RS sets of SpCell (as specified in Clause 5.17) configured with two BFD-RS sets and the SpCell is to be indicated in a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE and the UL-SCH resources available for transmission cannot accommodate the Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE with the four octets Ci bitmap plus its subheader as a result of LCP.

For Enhanced BFR MAC CE and Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE, a single octet \( S_{k} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells configured with two BFD-RS sets for which SP/C, field set to 1 is greater than 0 and less than 9; a two octets \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells configured with two BFD-RS sets for which \( \mathrm{SP} / \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 1 is greater than 8 and less than 17; a three octets \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells configured with two BFD-RS sets for which SP/ \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field is set to 1 is greater than 16 and less than 25; a four octets \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells configured with two BFD-RS sets for which SP/C 1 is greater than \( 24 ; \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is not included if the total number of Serving Cells configured with two BFD-RS sets for which SP/C, field is set to 1 is zero.

For Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE, octet(s) containing the AC field, if any, are included for SpCell first, then one octet containing the AC field is included for SCell(s) (in ascending order of the ServCellIndex) and then the second
