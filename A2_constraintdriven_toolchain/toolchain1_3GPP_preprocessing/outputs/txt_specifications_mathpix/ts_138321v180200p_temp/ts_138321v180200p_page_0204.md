The sl-LBT-RecoveryTimer is used for recovery of the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if Sidelink consistent LBT failure has been triggered, and not cancelled, in the RB set(s), and SL LBT failure MAC CE for the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure has not been generated;

2 if the sl-LBT-RecoveryTimer for the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure is not running:
\( 3> \) start the \( s /-L B T \)-RecoveryTimer.
\( 2> \) if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL LBT failure MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1:
\( 3> \) instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure in clause 5.4 .3 to generate the SL LBT failure MAC CE(s).
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) trigger a Scheduling Request for SL LBT failure MAC CE.
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes the SL LBT failure MAC CE; or
\( 2> \) cancel the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure(s) in RB set(s) for which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was indicated in the transmitted SL LBT failure MAC CE if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1.
\( 1> \) if the \( s l-L B T \)-RecoveryTimer for the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure(s) expires:
\( 2> \) cancel the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure(s) in RB set(s) for which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was detected.
\( 1> \) if \( s l- \) Ibt-FailureRecoveryConfig is reconfigured by upper layers for the BWP:
\( 2> \) cancel all the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure(s) in the SL BWP.
5.32 SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping

SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping can be supported for UE in RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_INACTIVE. The UE can be configured with UTW during which the UE is allowed to transmit SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping.

RRC configures the following parameters for the UTW for SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping:
- utw-SlotPeriodicity: Periodicity of the UTW in slot;
- utw-SlotOffset: Offset of the beginning of the UTW with respect to the beginning of the UTW periodicity in time domain in slot;
- uplinkTimeWindowTimer: Time duration when the UE performs SRS transmission for positioning Tx frequency hopping.

When UTW is configured, the MAC entity shall start the uplinkTimeWindowTimer in the first symbol of the slot for which the following condition is satisfied
\[
\text { CURRENT_slot modulo (utw-SlotPeriodicity) }=u t w \text {-SlotOffset }
\]
where CURRENT_slot \( =( \) SFN × numberOfSlotsPerFrame \( )+ \) slot number in the frame and numberOfSlotsPerFrame refers to the number of consecutive slots per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [8].

When UTW is configured and the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, the MAC entity shall instruct the lower layer to transmit SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping when the uplinkTime WindowTimer is running.
