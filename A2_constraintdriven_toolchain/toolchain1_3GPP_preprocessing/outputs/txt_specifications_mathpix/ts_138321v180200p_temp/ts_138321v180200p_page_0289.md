- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneous U-TCI-UpdateList I, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneous U-TCIUpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCIUpdateList4, respectively;
- DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
- \( F_{1,1} \) : This field indicates for the TCI state ID fields associated with the codepoint \( i \) of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field whether the j -th joint TCI state is present or not, where \( \mathrm{j}=1,2 \). If \( \mathrm{F}_{1, \mathrm{j}} \) field is set to 1 , it indicates the \( j \)-th joint TCI state for codepoint \( i \) is present. If \( F_{1, j} \) field is set to 0 , it indicates the \( j \)-th joint TCI state for codepoint \( i \) is absent. The codepoint to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI state ID fields;
- TCI state ID: This field indicates the 7-bits length TCI state ID identified by TCI-Stateld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The maximum number of activated TCI states is 16 ;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

Figure 6.1.3.70-1: Enhanced TCI state activation/deactivation MAC CE for Joint TCI States
6.1.3.71 Enhanced Unified TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE for Separate TCI States

The Enhanced Unified TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE CE for Separate TCI States is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-lb. It has a variable size consisting of following fields:
- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a simultaneous U-TCI-UpdateList I, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4 as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this MAC CE applies to all theServing Cells in the set simultaneous U-TCIUpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3 or simultaneousU-TCIUpdateList4, respectively;
- DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
- UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
