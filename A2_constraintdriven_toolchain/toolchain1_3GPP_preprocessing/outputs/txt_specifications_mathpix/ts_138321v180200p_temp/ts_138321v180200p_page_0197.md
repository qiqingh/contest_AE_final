5.28 Sidelink Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
5.28.1 General

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with an SL DRX functionality that controls the UE's SCI (i.e., \( 1{ }^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI and \( 2{ }^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI) monitoring activity for unicast, groupcast and broadcast. When using SL DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also monitor SCI (ie., \( 1^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI and \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI) according to requirements found in other clauses of this specification.

Sidelink DRX and UE procedure on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool are not applied at the same time.
RRC controls Sidelink DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
- sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer: the duration at the beginning of an SL DRX cycle;
- sl-drx-SlotOffset: the delay before starting the sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer;
- sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer (except for the SL broadcast communication): the duration after the first slot of SCI (i.e., \( 1^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI and \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI) reception in which an SCI indicates a new SL transmission for the MAC entity;
- sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer (per Sidelink process except for the SL broadcast process): the maximum duration until an SL retransmission is received;
- sl-drx-StartOffset: the slot where the SL DRX cycle starts;
- sl-drx-Cycle/sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle: the Sidelink DRX cycle;
- sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer/sl-DRX-GC-HARQ-RTT-Timer (per Sidelink process except for the SL broadcast process): the minimum duration before an SL HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.
5.28.2 Behaviour of UE receiving SL-SCH Data

When SL DRX is configured, the Active Time includes the time while:
- sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer or sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GCInactivityTimer is running; or
- sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer is running; or
- period of s/-LatencyBoundCSI-Report configured by RRC in case SL-CSI reporting MAC CE is not received; or
- the time between the transmission of the request of SL-CSI reporting and the reception of the SL-CSI reporting MAC CE in case SL-CSI reporting MAC CE is received; or
- Slot(s) associated with the announced periodic transmission(s) by the UE transmitting SL-SCH Data; or
- the time between transmission/reception of Direct Link Establishment Request message (TS 24.587 [28]) or ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request message (TS 24.554 [29]) and reception of RRCReconfigurationSidelink message including initial DRX configuration or the link establishment procedure being aborted by upper layer; or
- the time between transmission of RRCReconfigurationSidelink message including initial DRX configuration and reception of corresponding RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink or RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink message.

When one or multiple SL DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if a single sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle that is mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List or a single sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle that is configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC and cannot be mapped with any SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List is associated to a Destination and the associated cast type is groupcast or broadcast:
