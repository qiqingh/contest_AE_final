Figure 6.1.3.36-5: Spatial Relation for Resource IDi with DL-PRS

The field Spatial Relation for Resource [D, consists of the following fields:
- \( F_{0} \) : This field indicates the type of a resource used as a spatial relation for the \( i^{\text {th }} \) Positioning SRS resource within the Positioning SRS Resource Set indicated with the field Positioning SRS Resource Set ID. The field is set to 00 to indicate NZP CSI-RS resource index is used; it is set to 01 to indicate SSB index is used; it is set to 10 to indicate SRS resource index is used; it is set to 11 to indicate DL-PRS index is used. The length of the field is 2 bits;
- \( F_{1} \) : This field indicates the type of SRS resource used as spatial relation for the \( i^{\text {th }} \) Positioning SRS resource within the SP Positioning SRS Resource Set indicated with the field Positioning SRS Resource Set ID when \( \mathrm{F}_{0} \) is set to 10 . The field is set to 0 to indicate SRS resource index SRS-Resourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5] is used; the field is set to 1 to indicate Positioning SRS resource index SRS-PosResourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5] is used;
- NZP CSI-RS Resource ID: This field contains an index of NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceID, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], indicating the NZP CSI-RS resource, which is used to derive the spatial relation for the positioning SRS. The length of the field is 8 bits;
- SSB index: This field contains an index of SSB SSB-Index as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and/or TS 37.355 [23]. The length of the field is 6 bits;
- PCI: This field contains physical cell identity PhysCellld as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and/or TS 37.355 [23]. The length of the field is 10 bits;
- SRS resource ID: When \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , the field indicates an index for SRS resource SRS-Resourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5]; When \( F_{1} \) is set to 1 , the field indicates an index for Positioning SRS resource SRS-PosResourceld as defined in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 5 bits representing the index from 0 to 31;
