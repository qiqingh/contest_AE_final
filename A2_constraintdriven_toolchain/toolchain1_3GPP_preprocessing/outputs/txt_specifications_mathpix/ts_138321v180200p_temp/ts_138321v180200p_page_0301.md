- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
- \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) : This field indicates the activation/deactivation status of the Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration within csi-ReportConfigToAddModList, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. So refers to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the lowest CSI-ReportConfigId within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH, \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) to the report configuration which includes PUCCH resources for SP CSI reporting in the indicated BWP and has the second lowest CSI-ReportConfigId and so on. If the number of report configurations within the list with type set to semiPersistentOnPUCCH in the indicated BWP is less than \( i+1 \), MAC entity shall ignore the \( S_{1} \) field. The \( S_{1} \) field is set to 1 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration shall be activated. The \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) field is set to 0 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report configuration i shall be deactivated;
- \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{i}, \mathrm{x}} \) : this field indicates the activation/deactivation status of the Semi-Persistent CSI report sub-configuration x within csi-ReportSubConfigToAddModList of CSI-ReportConfigId i , as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) set to 1, the octet corresponding to \( \mathrm{N}_{1,0} \) to \( \mathrm{N}_{1,7} \) is present. If \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) set to 0 , the octet corresponding to \( \mathrm{N}_{1,0} \) to \( \mathrm{N}_{1,7} \) is not present. \( \mathrm{N}_{0,0} \) refers to the report sub-configuration which has the lowest csi-ReportSubConfigID within the list, \( \mathrm{N}_{0,1} \) to the report sub-configuration which has the second lowest csi-ReportSubConfigID and so on. If the number of report sub-configurations within the list with type set to csi-ReportSubConfigToAddModList in the indicated BWP is less than \( \mathrm{x}+1 \), the MAC entity shall ignore the \( \mathrm{N}_{1, \mathrm{x}} \) field. The \( \mathrm{N}_{1, \mathrm{x}} \) field is set to 1 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report sub-configuration x shall be activated. The \( \mathrm{N}_{1, \mathrm{x}} \) field is set to 0 to indicate that the corresponding Semi-Persistent CSI report sub-configuration x shall be deactivated;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

Figure 6.1.3.80-1: Enhanced SP CSI reporting on PUCCH Activation/Deactivation MAC CE
6.1.3.81 Enhanced Single Entry PHR for multiple TRP STx2P MAC CE

The Enhanced Single Entry PHR for multiple TRP STx2P MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.

The two PHs together with two \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) for the Serving Cell are reported if UE is configured with twoPHRMode and multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN, as specified in clause 5.4.6.

It has a fixed size and consists of four octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.81-1):
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- Power Headroom \( \mathrm{k}(\mathrm{PH} \mathrm{k}) \) : This field indicates the power headroom level for \( \mathrm{k}=1,2 \), where PH 1 is associated with the first TCI-State or TCI-UL-State for a real or reference PUSCH transmission and PH 2 is associated with the second TCI-State or TCI-UL-State for a real or reference PUSCH transmission, as specified in TS 38.213
