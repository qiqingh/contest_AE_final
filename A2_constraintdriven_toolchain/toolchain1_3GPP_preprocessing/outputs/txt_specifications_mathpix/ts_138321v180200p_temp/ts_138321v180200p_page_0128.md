\( 2> \) if the Serving Cell is SpCell and the Random Access procedure initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery is successfully completed (see clause 5.1):
\( 3> \) set BFI_COUNTER to 0;
3> stop the beamFailureRecoveryTimer, if configured;
3> if the Random Access procedure was triggered by beam failure recovery for NCR-MT:
4> indicate to NCR-Fwd to resume forwarding using the last forwarding configuration received by NCRMT as part of side control information before beam failure detection;

3> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed.
\( 2> \) else if the Serving Cell is SCell, and a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI indicating uplink grant for a new transmission is received for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the MAC CE for BFR which contains beam failure recovery information of this Serving Cell; or
\( 2> \) if the SCell is deactivated as specified in clause 5.9:
\( 3> \) set BFI_COUNTER to 0;
3> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed and cancel all the triggered BFRs for this Serving Cell.

The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR has been triggered and not cancelled for an SCell for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed and if none of the Serving Cell(s) of this MAC entity are configured with two BFD-RS sets:
\( 2> \) if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:
\( 3> \) instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BFR MAC CE.
\( 2> \) else if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Truncated BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:

3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Truncated BFR MAC CE.
\( 2> \) else:
3> trigger the SR for SCell beam failure recovery for each SCell for which BFR has been triggered, not cancelled, and for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed.

1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR for any BFD-RS set has been triggered and not cancelled for an SCell for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed; or

1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR for only one BFD-RS set has been triggered and not cancelled for an SpCell for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed; or

1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR has been triggered and not cancelled for an SCell for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed and if at least one Serving Cell of this MAC entity is configured with two BFD-RS sets:
\( 2> \) if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Enhanced BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:

3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Enhanced BFR MAC CE.
\( 2> \) else if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:
