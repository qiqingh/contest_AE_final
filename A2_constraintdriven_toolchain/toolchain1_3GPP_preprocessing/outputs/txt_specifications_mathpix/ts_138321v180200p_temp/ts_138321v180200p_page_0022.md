- prach-ConfigurationSOffset-IAB: the subframe/slot offset defined in TS 38.211 [8] and applicable to [AB-MTs, altering the ROs subframe or slot defined in the baseline configuration indicated by prach-ConfigurationIndex;
- msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex: the available set of PRACH occasions for the transmission of the Random Access Preamble for MSGA in 2-step RA type;
- preambleReceivedTargetPower: initial Random Access Preamble power for 4-step RA type;
- msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower: initial Random Access Preamble power for 2-step RA type;
- rsrp-ThresholdSSB: an RSRP threshold for the selection of the SSB for 4-step RA type. If the Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure recovery, rsrp-ThresholdSSB used for the selection of the SSB within candidateBeamRSList refers to rsrp-ThresholdSSB in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig IE;
- rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS: an RSRP threshold for the selection of CSI-RS for 4-step RA type. If the Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure recovery, rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS is equal to rsrp-ThresholdSSB in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig IE;
- msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB: an RSRP threshold for the selection of the SSB for 2-step RA type;
- rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL: an RSRP threshold for the selection between the NUL carrier and the SUL carrier;
- msgA-RSRP-Threshold: an RSRP threshold for selection between 2-step RA type and 4-step RA type when both 2-step and 4-step RA type Random Access Resources are configured in the UL BWP;
- rsrp-ThresholdMsgl-RepetitionNum2: an RSRP threshold for Msg1 repetition with repetition number 2 (see clause 5.1.1b);
- rsrp-ThresholdMsgl-RepetitionNum4: an RSRP threshold for Msg1 repetition with repetition number 4 (see clause 5.1.1b);
- rsrp-ThresholdMsgl-RepetitionNum8: an RSRP threshold for Msg1 repetition with repetition number 8 (see clause 5.1.1b);
- rsrp-ThresholdMsg3: an RSRP threshold for Msg3 repetition (see clause 5.1.1b);
- FeatureCombination: feature or a combination of features associated with a set of Random Access resources;
- featurePriorities: priorities for features, such as (e)RedCap, Slicing, etc. (see clause 5.1.1d);
- msgA-TransMax: The maximum number of MSGA transmissions when both 4 -step and 2 -step RA type Random Access Resources are configured;
- candidateBeamRSList: a list of reference signals (CSI-RS and/or SSB) identifying the candidate beams for recovery and the associated Random Access parameters;
- recoverySearchSpaceld: the search space identity for monitoring the response of the beam failure recovery request;
- powerRampingStep: the power-ramping factor;
- msgA-PreamblePowerRampingStep: the power ramping factor for MSGA preamble;
- powerRampingStepHighPriority: the power-ramping factor in case of prioritized Random Access procedure;
- scalingFactorBI: a scaling factor for prioritized Random Access procedure;
- ra-PreambleIndex: Random Access Preamble;
- ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex: defines PRACH occasion(s) associated with an SSB in which the MAC entity may transmit a Random Access Preamble (see clause 7.4);
- msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex: Indicates the subset of 4-step RA type PRACH occasions shared with 2-step RA type PRACH occasions for each SSB. If 2-step RA type PRACH occasions are shared with 4-step RA type PRACH occasions and \( m s g A \)-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex is not configured, then all 4-step RA type PRACH occasions are available for 2-step RA type (see clause 7.4);
