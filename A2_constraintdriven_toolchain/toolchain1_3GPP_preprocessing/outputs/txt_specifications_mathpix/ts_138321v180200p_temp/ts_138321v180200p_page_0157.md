7> randomly select the time and frequency resources in the first of NR SL slots overlapping with an LTE SL subframe for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
\( 5> \) else if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] which occur within the SL DRX Active time, if configured, as specified in clause 5.28 .2 of the destination UE selected for indicating to the physical layer the SL DRX Active time above, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

5> if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by physical layer as clasue 8.2 .4 of TS 38.214 [7] as specified in clause 5.28 .2 , according to the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission.

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and preferred resource set is not received from a UE:

4- if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers:
\( 5> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources pool excluding all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled and the resources of which the lowest sub-channel includes intra cell guard band PRBs if sl-transmissionStructureForPSCCHandPSSCH is set to 'contiguousRB' are excluded, if configured according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

\( 5> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE does not have own sensing result as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE and if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources belonging to the received preferred resource set for a MAC PDU to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
