NOTE 1: The path loss variation for one cell assessed above is between the pathloss measured at present time on the current pathloss reference and the pathloss measured at the transmission time of the last transmission of PHR on the pathloss reference in use at that time, irrespective of whether the pathloss reference has changed in between. The current pathloss reference for this purpose does not include any pathloss reference configured using pathlossReferenceRS-Pos in TS 38.331 [5].
- phr-PeriodicTimer expires;
- upon configuration or reconfiguration of the power headroom reporting functionality by upper layers, which is not used to disable the function;
- activation of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink of which firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id is not set to dormant BWP;
- activation of an SCG;
- addition of the PSCell except if the SCG is deactivated (i.e. PSCell is newly added or changed);
- phr-ProhibitTimer expires or has expired, when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission, and the following is true for any of the activated Serving Cells of any MAC entity with configured uplink:
- there are UL resources allocated for transmission or there is a PUCCH transmission on this cell, and the required power backoff due to power management (as allowed by \( \mathrm{P}-\mathrm{MPR}_{\mathrm{c}} \) as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]) for this cell has changed more than phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange dB since the last transmission of a PHR when the MAC entity had UL resources allocated for transmission or PUCCH transmission on this cell.
- Upon switching of activated BWP from dormant BWP to non-dormant DL BWP of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink;
- if dpc-Reporting-FRI is configured, \( \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {PowerClass }} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {PowerClass, }} \mathrm{CA} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {PowerClass, }} \mathrm{EN}-\mathrm{DC} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {PowerClass, }} \mathrm{NR}-\mathrm{DC} \) reporting is triggered upon uplink duty cycle exceedance or upon return to the power class after the duty cycle exceedance, as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14] and TS 38.101-3 [16]).
- if mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and mpe-ProhibitTimer is not running:
- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15] is equal to or larger than mpe-Threshold for at least one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC entity; or
- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15] has changed more than phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange dB for at least one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR due to the measured P-MPR applied to meet MPE requirements being equal to or larger than mpe-Threshold in this MAC entity.
in which case the PHR is referred below to as 'MPE P-MPR report'.
NOTE 2: The MAC entity should avoid triggering a PHR when the required power backoff due to power management decreases only temporarily (e.g. for up to a few tens of milliseconds) and it should avoid reflecting such temporary decrease in the values of \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{C}} / \mathrm{PH} \) when a PHR is triggered by other triggering conditions.

NOTE 3: If a HARQ process is configured with cg-RetransmissionTimer and if the PHR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE implementation how to handle the PHR content.

If the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for a new transmission the MAC entity shall:
1> if it is the first UL resource allocated for a new transmission since the last MAC reset:
\( 2> \) start phr-PeriodicTimer.
\( 1> \) if the Power Headroom reporting procedure determines that at least one PHR has been triggered and not cancelled; and
