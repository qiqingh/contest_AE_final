entity shall set the \( P \) field to 1 if the corresponding \( P_{C M A X, N, C} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) : If present, this field indicates the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) for the NR Serving Cell and the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) or \( \tilde{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 36.213 [17]) for the E-UTRA Serving Cell used for calculation of the preceding PH field. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX,N,C}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dBm for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
- MPE: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the P field is set to 1 , this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the \( P \) field is set to \( 0, R \) bits are present instead;
- \( B_{1} \) : This field indicates whether the candidate beam information identified by either Resource, is present or not. If the \( B_{1} \) field is set to 1 , the first octet containing Resource is present and if the \( B_{2} \) field is set to 1 , the second octet containing Resource \( _{2} \) is present, and so on.
- \( \quad \mathrm{P}_{1} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise;
- MPE \( \mathrm{E}_{1} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \) field is set to 1 , this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. [f mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the P, field is set to O, R bits are present instead;
- Resource, This field indicates the candidate beam identified by by the number of entries in the corresponding mpe-ResourcePoolToAddModList as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of this field 6 bits.
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
