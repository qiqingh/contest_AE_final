4.5.3 Logical Channels

The MAC sublayer provides data transfer services on logical channels. To accommodate different kinds of data transfer services, multiple types of logical channels are defined i.e. each supporting transfer of a particular type of information.

Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred.
The MAC sublayer provides the control and traffic channels listed in Table 4.5.3-1 below.

4.5.4 Mapping of Transport Channels to Logical Channels
4.5.4.1 General

The MAC entity is responsible for mapping logical channels onto transport channels. This mapping depends on the multiplexing that is configured by RRC.
4.5.4.2 Uplink mapping

The uplink logical channels can be mapped as described in Table 4.5.4.2-1.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Logical channel & UL-SCH & RACH \\
\hline CCCH & X & \\
\hline DCCH & X & \\
\hline DTCH & X & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
4.5.4.3 Downlink mapping

The downlink logical channels can be mapped as described in Table 4.5.4.3-1.
