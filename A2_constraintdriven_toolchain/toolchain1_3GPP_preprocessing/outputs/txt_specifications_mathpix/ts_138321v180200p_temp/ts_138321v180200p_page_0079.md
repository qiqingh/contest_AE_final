4> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant configured with autonomous \( T x \) whose PUSCH has already started:
\( 5> \) stop the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
\( 5> \) stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
\( 4> \) if SR_COUNTER<sr-TransMax:
\( 5> \) instruct the physical layer to signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR;
\( 5> \) if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
\( 6> \) increment SR_COUNTER by 1;
\( 6>s \) start the sr-ProhibitTimer.
\( 5> \) else if \( I b t \)-FailureRecoveryConfig is not configured:
\( 6> \) increment SR_COUNTER by 1 .
4> else:
\( 5> \) notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells;
\( 5> \) notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells;
\( 5> \) clear any configured downlink assignments and uplink grants;
\( 5> \) clear any PUSCH resources for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
\( 5> \) if rach-LessHO is not configured and if there is no ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch:
\( 6> \) initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and cancel all pending SRs.
3> else:
\( 4> \) consider the SR transmission as a de-prioritized SR transmission.
NOTE 1: Except for SR for SCell beam failure recovery, the selection of which valid PUCCH resource for SR to signal SR on when the MAC entity has more than one overlapping valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion is left to UE implementation.

NOTE 2: If more than one individual SR triggers an instruction from the MAC entity to the PHY layer to signal the SR on the same valid PUCCH resource, the SR_COUNTER for the relevant SR configuration is incremented only once.

NOTE 3: When the MAC entity has pending SR for SCell beam failure recovery and the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources (other than PUCCH resources of pending SR for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set) overlapping with PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery for the SR transmission occasion, the MAC entity considers only the PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery as valid. When the MAC entity has pending SR for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set of Serving Cell and the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources (other than PUCCH resources of pending SR for beam failure recovery) overlapping with PUCCH resource for beam failure recovery of that BFD-RS set for the SR transmission occasion, the MAC entity considers only the PUCCH resource for beam failure recovery of that BFD-RS set as valid.

NOTE 4: For a UE operating in a semi-static channel access mode as described in TS 37.213 [18], PUCCH resources overlapping with the set of consecutive symbols where the UE does not transmit before the start of a next channel occupancy time are not considered valid.
