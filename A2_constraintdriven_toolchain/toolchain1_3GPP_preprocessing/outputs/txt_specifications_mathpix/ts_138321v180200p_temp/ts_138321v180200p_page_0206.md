- receiving a cell DTX indication from lower layers indicating activation or deactivation of cell DTX operation, as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
- configuring cellDTX-DRX-Config by upper layers: if cell DTX is configured and cellDTX-DRX-ActivationStatus is set to activated, cell DTX operation is activated upon cell DTX configuration; if cell DTX is configured and cellDTX-DRX-ActivationStatus is set to deactivated, cell DTX operation is deactivated upon cell DTX configuration; if cellDTX-DRX-Config is released, cell DTX operation is deactivated and all the corresponding configurations are released.

When cell DTX is configured and activated for a Serving Cell, the cell DTX Active Period includes the time while:
- cellDTX-DRX-onDurationTimer is running for the associated Serving Cell.

For each Serving Cell configured with cell DTX, the MAC entity shall:
1> if cell DTX is activated for this Serving Cell:
\( 2> \) if \( [(\mathrm{SFN} \times 10)+ \) subframe number \( ] \) modulo \( ( \) cellDTX-DRX-Cycle \( )=( \) cellDTX-DRX-StartOffset \( ): \)
\( 3> \) start cellDTX-DRX-onDurationTimer for this serving cell after cellDTX-DRX-SlotOffset from the beginning of the subframe.

1> if cell DTX operation is deactivated for this Serving Cell; or
1> if the Serving Cell is in the cell DTX Active Period:
\( 2> \) monitor PDCCH on this Serving Cell, as specified in TS 38.213 [6] and other clauses of this specification.
\( 1> \) if any drx-RetransmissionTimerDL, drx-RetransmissionTimer \( U L \) or drx-RetransmissionTimerSL (as described in clause 5.7) is running on any Serving Cell in the DRX group of this Serving Cell; or
\( 1> \) if \( r a \)-ContentionResolutionTimer (as described in clause 5.1.5) or msgB-ResponseWindow (as described in clause 5.1.4a) is running; or
\( 1> \) if a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending (as described in clause 5.4 .4 or 5.22.1.5); or
1> if a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among the contention-based Random Access Preamble (as described in clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.4a):
\( 2> \) monitor PDCCH on the Serving Cells in the DRX group of this Serving Cell, as specified in TS 38.213 [6] and other clauses of this specification.
\( 1> \) if ra-ResponseWindow (as described in clause 5.1.4) is running and this Serving Cell is the SpCell:
\( 2> \) monitor PDCCH on this Serving Cell (as described in clause 5.1.4).
For each Serving Cell configured with cell DTX, the MAC entity need not:
\( 1> \) if cell DTX operation is activated and the Serving Cell is not in the cell DTX Active Period:
\( 2> \) monitor PDCCH for the MAC entity's RNTIs listed in clauses 5.7 and 5.7b, irrespective of the requirements of clauses 5.7 and 5.7b, unless stated otherwise in this clause;
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to receive transport block on the DL-SCH of this Serving Cell according to a configured downlink assignment for SPS;
\( 2> \) indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity;
\( 2> \) set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with the PDSCH duration of a configured downlink assignment;
\( 2> \) consider the NDI bit for the HARQ process corresponding to the PDSCH duration of a configured downlink assignment to have been toggled for the configured downlink assignment.
