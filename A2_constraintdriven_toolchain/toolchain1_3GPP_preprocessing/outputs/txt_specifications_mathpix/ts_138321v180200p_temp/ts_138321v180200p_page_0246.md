- Spatial Relation for Resource [D: The field Spatial Relation for Resource [D, is only present if MAC CE is used for activation, i.e. the A/D field is set to \( 1 . M \) is the total number of Positioning SRS resource(s) configured under the SP Positioning SRS resource set indicated by the field Positioning SRS Resource Set ID. There are 4 types of Spatial Relation for Resource \( \mathrm{ID}_{1} \), which is indicated by the \( \mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{F}_{0}\right. \) and \( \left.\mathrm{F}_{1}\right) \) field within. The fields within Spatial Relation for Resource \( \mathrm{ID}_{1} \) are shown in Figures 6.1.3.36-2 to 6.1.3.36-5 for the 4 types of Spatial Relations for Resource [ \( \mathrm{D}_{1} \);
- S: This field indicates whether the fields Spatial Relation for Resource ID, for the positioning SRS resource i within the positioning SRS resource set are present. If the field is set to 1 , the fields Spatial Relation for Resource IDi are present; otherwise, they are absent;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
