NOTE 5: If the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, the MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission can be signalled by the physical layer and the SR transmission occasion overlaps with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant of a MSGA payload.

NOTE 6: When the MAC entity has PUCCH resource for pending SR for SCell beam failure recovery overlapping with PUCCH resource for pending SR for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set for the SR transmission occasion, it's up to UE implementation to select PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery or PUCCH resource for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for BSR, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the MAC PDU assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
- the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for SL-BSR, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5-1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and the ongoing Random Access procedure was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the MAC PDU assembly, and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered an SL-BSR (see clause 5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
- the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission, and the ongoing Random Access procedure was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the sidelink MAC PDU assembly.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for SL-CSI reporting, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- the SL grant can accommodate SL-CSI reporting MAC CE for transmission.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for SL-DRX command indication, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- the SL grant can accommodate SL-DRX command indication for transmission.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for BFR of an SCell, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains a MAC CE for BFR which includes beam failure recovery information of that SCell; or
- the SCell is deactivated (as specified in clause 5.9) and all triggered BFRs for SCells are cancelled.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for BFR of a BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains an Enhanced BFR MAC CE or a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE which includes beam failure recovery information of that BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for consistent LBT failure recovery, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an LBT failure MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure; or
