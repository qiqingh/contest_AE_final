clause 8.1 . 4 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE and if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity within the intersection of the received preferred resource set and the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for a MAC PDU to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting;

4> if there are no resources within the intersection that can be selected as the time and frequency resources for the one transmission opportunity according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier.

5> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE determines the resources for Sidelink InterUE Coordination Information transmission upon explicit request from a UE:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting and the latency requirement of the Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available.

3> if one or more SL-PRS retransmissions are selected and the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources, according to the selected number of retransmissions and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9];

4> consider the first set of transmission opportunities as the initial transmission opportunities and the other set(s) of transmission opportunities as the retransmission opportunities;
\( 4> \) consider the sets of initial transmission opportunities and retransmission opportunities as the selected sidelink grant.

3> else if one or more HARQ retransmissions are selected and the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is not configured by RRC:
\( 5> \) if transmission based on full sensing or partial sensing is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resources indicated by the physical layer according to clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for more transmission opportunities; or
\( 5> \) if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resources pool for more transmission opportunities:

6> if sl-NRPSSCH-EUTRA-ThresRSRP-List is configured by the RRC:
\( 7> \) when SCS of NR SL is (pre-)configured as \( \mu=0 \) :
8> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214
