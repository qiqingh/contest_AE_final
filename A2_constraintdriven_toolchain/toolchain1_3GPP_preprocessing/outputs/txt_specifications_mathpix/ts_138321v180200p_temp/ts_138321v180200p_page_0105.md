\( 4> \) if the PDCCH is indicated on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
\( 5> \) set HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 5> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.

4> else:
\( 5> \) start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback;

4> if the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode (i.e. ack-nack) is used as specified in TS 38.213 [6]:
\( 5> \) if the PDCCH addressed to G-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission; or
\( 5> \) if the PDCCH addressed to G-CS-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission and CS-RNTI is configured:
\( 6> \) if the PDCCH is indicated on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
\( 7> \) set HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 7> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.
\( 6> \) else:
7> start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.

3> else if drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM is configured for multicast in RRC_INACTIVE, and the UE supports ptm-RetransmissionInactive:

4> start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding multicast transmission.

3> else if drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM is configured:
\( 4> \) if the PDCCH is indicated on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-
ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
\( 5> \) set HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 5> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback that would be performed if HARQ feedback were enabled.

4> else:
\( 5> \) start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback that would be performed if HARQ feedback were enabled.

3> stop the drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process;
\( 3> \) stop the drx-RetransmissionTimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process.
2 if the PDCCH indicates a new multicast transmission for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
3> start or restart drx-InactivityTimerPTM in the first symbol after the end of the PDCCH reception.
