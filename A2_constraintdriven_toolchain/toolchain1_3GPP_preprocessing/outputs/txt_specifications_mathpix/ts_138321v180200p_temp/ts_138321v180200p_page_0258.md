Figure 6.1.3.47-1: Unified TCI state activation/deactivation MAC CE
6.1.3.48 Enhanced Single Entry PHR MAC CE

The Enhanced Single Entry PHR MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.12b. It has a variable size with following fields:
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- Power Headroom (PH): This field indicates the power headroom level. The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 below (the corresponding measured values in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- P: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than PMPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by \( \mathrm{P}_{-} \mathrm{MPR}_{\mathrm{c}} \) as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- P \( _{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{C}} \) : This field indicates the P \( _{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) used for calculation of the preceding PH field. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{JC}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- MPE: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the P field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the P field is set to \( 0, \mathrm{R} \) bits are present instead;
- \( B_{1} \) : This field indicates whether the candidate beam information identified by Resource, is present or not. If the \( B_{1} \) field is set to 1 , the first octet containing Resource is present and if the \( B_{2} \) field is set to 1 , the second octet containing Resource \( { }_{2} \) is present, and so on;
- \( \mathrm{P}_{1} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise;
- MPE \( \mathrm{E}_{1} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the corresponding \( P_{1} \) field is set to 1 , this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR
