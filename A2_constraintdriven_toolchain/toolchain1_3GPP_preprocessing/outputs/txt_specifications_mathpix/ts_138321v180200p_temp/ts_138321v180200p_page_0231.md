set to 0 to indicate either SSB index or SRS resource index is used. The length of the field is 1 bit. This field is only present if MAC CE is used for activation, i.e. the A/D field is set to 1 ;
- Resource ID: This field contains an identifier of the resource used for spatial relationship derivation for SRS resource i. Resource [D0 refers to the first SRS resource within the resource set, Resource [D1 to the second one and so on. If \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , and the first bit of this field is set to 1 , the remainder of this field contains SSB-Index as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , and the first bit of this field is set to 0 , the remainder of this field contains SRS-Resourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 7 bits. This field is only present if MAC CE is used for activation, i.e. the A/D field is set to 1;
- Resource Serving Cell [D]: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell on which the resource used for spatial relationship derivation for SRS resource \( i \) is located. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- Resource BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9], on which the resource used for spatial relationship derivation for SRS resource \( i \) is located. The length of the field is 2 bits;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

6.1.3.18 PUCCH spatial relation Activation/Deactivation MAC CE

The PUCCH spatial relation Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1. It has a fixed size of 24 bits with following fields:
- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
- PUCCH Resource ID: This field contains an identifier of the PUCCH resource ID identified by PUCCHResourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 7 bits;
- \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) : If, in PUCCH-Config in which the PUCCH Resource ID is configured, there is a PUCCH Spatial Relation Info with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfold as specified in TS 38.331 [5], configured for the uplink bandwidth part indicated by BWP ID field, \( \mathrm{S}_{1} \) indicates the activation status of PUCCH Spatial Relation [nfo with PUCCHSpatialRelationInfold equal to \( i+1 \), otherwise MAC entity shall ignore this field. The \( S_{1} \) field is set to 1 to indicate PUCCH Spatial Relation Info with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfold equal to \( \mathrm{i}+1 \) shall be activated. The
