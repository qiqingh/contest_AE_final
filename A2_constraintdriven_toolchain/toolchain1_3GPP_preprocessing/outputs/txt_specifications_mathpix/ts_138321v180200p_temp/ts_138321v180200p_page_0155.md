\( 5> \) select any pool of resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in \( s l-B W P \) DiscPoolConfig, sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, sl-BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWPPoolConfigCommonA2X, if configured or Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, if configured.
\( 3> \) else if SL-PRS is pending for transmission:
\( 4> \) select any resource pool among the resource pool(s) allowing for SL-PRS transmission.
\( 3> \) else if an SL-CSI reporting or a Sidelink DRX Command or a Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request or a Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information is triggered:
\( 4> \) select any pool of resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in \( s /-B W P \) DiscPoolConfig, sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, sl-BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWPPoolConfigCommonA2 \( X \), if configured or Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, if configured.
\( 2> \) else (i.e. multiple carrier frequencies are configured):
\( 3> \) trigger the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure as specified in clause 5.22.1.11.
\( 2> \) if Sidelink consistent LBT Failure is detected as specified in clause 5.31 .2 in all RB sets of the selected resource pool for the logical channel, if single carrier frequency is configured:
\( 3> \) clear the selected sidelink grant on the selected pool of resources.
\( 3> \) if \( s \) /-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to enabled for the logical channel:
\( 4> \) select any pool of resources configured with PSFCH resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, if configured and the pool(s) including all RB sets for which Sidelink consistent LBT failures were detected and not cancelled.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) select any pool of resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in \( s /-B W P \) DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, if configured and the pool(s) including all RB sets for which Sidelink consistent LBT failures were detected and not cancelled.
\( 2> \) perform the TX resource (re-)selection check on the selected pool of resources as specified in clause 5.22.1.2;
\( 2> \) if the TX resource (re-)selection is triggered as the result of the TX resource (re-)selection check
\( 3> \) if \( s l- \) bt-FailureRecoveryConfig is configured in the SL BWP:
\( 4> \) indicate to the physical layer RB set information for which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was detected and not cancelled as specified in clause 5.31.2.
\( 3> \) if the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure was triggered in above and one or more carriers have been (re-
)selected in the Tx carrier (re-)selection according to clause 5.22.1.11:
\( 4> \) determine the order of the (re-)selected carriers, according to the decreasing order based on the highest priority of logical channels which are allowed on each (re-)selected carrier, and perform the resource selection procedure as specified in this clause for each Sidelink process on each (re-)selected carrier according to the order.
\( 3> \) if one or multiple SL DRX(s) is configured in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data:
4 - indicate to the physical layer SL DRX Active time in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data, as specified in clause 5.28.2.
\( 3> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 4> \) select the number of HARQ retransmissions from the allowed numbers, if configured by RRC, in \( s \) MaxTxTransNumPSSCH included in sl-PSSCH-TxConfigList and, if configured by RRC, overlapped in sl-MaxTxTransNumPSSCH indicated in sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList for the highest priority of the logical channel(s) and pending SL-PRS transmission(s), if available allowed on the carrier and the CBR measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [24] if CBR measurement
