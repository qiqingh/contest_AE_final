InactiveConfigList specified in TS 38.331 [5]. Value 0 corresponds to the first entry within the list SRS-PosResourceSetAggBW-CombinationList or SRS-PosRRC-AggBW-InactiveConfigList, value 1 corresponds to the second entry within the list SRS-PosResourceSetAggBW-CombinationList or SRS-PosRRC-AggBWInactiveConfigList and so on;
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{C}_{2}, \mathrm{C}_{3} \) : These fields indicate the activation/deactivation status of each Positioning SRS Resource Set that is linked for SRS for positioning bandwidth aggregation configured in SRS-PosResourceSetAggBWCombinationList or SRS-PosRRC-AggBW-InactiveConfigList specified in TS 38.331 [5]. C1 corresponds to the first entry in SRS-PosResourceSetAggBW-CombinationList or SRS-PosRRC-AggBW-InactiveConfigList, \( \mathrm{C}_{2} \) corresponds to the second one and so on. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field is set to 1 to indicate that the Positioning SRS Resource Set corresponding to \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) shall be activated. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field is set to 0 to indicate that the Positioning SRS Resource Set corresponding to \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) shall be de-activated;
- S: This field indicates whether the fields Spatial Relation for Resource [ \( D_{1} \) are present. If the field is set to 1 , the fields Spatial Relation for Resource [D, are present; otherwise, they are absent;
- Spatial Relation for Resource [ \( D_{1} \) : The field Spatial Relation for Resource [ \( D_{1} \) is only present if MAC CE is used for activation, i.e. at least one of the \( \mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{C}_{2} \), and \( \mathrm{C}_{3} \) is set to 1 . There can be as many as 16 entries of Spatial Relation for Resource \( \left[D_{1}\right. \) depending on the RRC configuration. There are 4 types of Spatial Relation for Resource \( \left[\mathrm{D}_{1}\right. \), which is indicated by the \( \mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{F}_{0}\right. \) and \( \left.\mathrm{F}_{1}\right) \) field within, defined as in Figure 6.1.3.36-2 to 6.1.3.36-5 in clause 6.1.3.36. Spatial Relation for Resource [D1 corresponds to the spatial relation of the first set of aggregated SRS resources corresponding to the indicated Positioning SRS aggregation ID/ffs what is the first aggregated SRS resource];
- C: This field indicates whether the octets containing Resource Serving Cell ID field(s) and Resource BWP ID field(s) within the field Spatial Relation for Resource ID, are present, except for Spatial Relation Resource ID, with DL-PRS or SSB. If the combination of the linked SRS resource sets is configured by the field SRS-PosResourceSetAggBW-CombinationList and this field is set to 1 , the octets containing Resource Serving Cell ID field(s) and Resource BWP ID field(s) in the field Spatial Relation for Resource ID, are present, otherwise if this field is set to 0 , they are not present; if the combination of the linked SRS resource sets is configured by the field SRS-PosRRC-AggBW-InactiveConfigList, this field shall be set to 0 and the octets containing Resource Serving Cell ID field(s) and Resource BWP ID field(s) in the field Spatial Relation for Resource ID, are not present;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
