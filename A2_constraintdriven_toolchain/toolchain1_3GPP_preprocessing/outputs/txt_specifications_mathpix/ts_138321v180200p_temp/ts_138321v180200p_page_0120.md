3GPP TS 38.321 version 18.2.0 Release 18
119
ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

based on instruction from PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). The dormancy SCell group configurations are configured by RRC signalling as described in TS 38.331 [5]. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating leaving dormant BWP, the DL BWP indicated by firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id or by firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id (as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and TS 38.213 [6]) is activated. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating entering dormant BWP, the DL BWP indicated by dormantBWP-Id (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) is activated. The dormant BWP configuration for SpCell or PUCCH SCell is not supported.

BWP for SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping can be configured for a Serving Cell in TS 38.331 [5]. BWP for SRS Tx frequency hopping is considered as activated when it is configured. BWP switching is not applicable for BWP for SRS Tx frequency hopping.

For each activated Serving Cell configured with a BWP, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is not the dormant BWP and the Serving Cell is not the PSCell of deactivated SCG:
\( 2> \) transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) transmit on RACH on the BWP, if PRACH occasions are configured;
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH on the BWP ;
◇ transmit PUCCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) report CSI for the BWP;
\( 2> \) transmit SRS on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2 (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant Type 1 on the active BWP according to the stored configuration, if any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
\( 2> \) if Ibt-FailureRecoveryConfig is configured:
\( 3> \) stop the Ibt-FailureDetectionTimer, if running;
\( 3> \) set LBT_COUNTER to 0;
3> monitor LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified in clause 5.21.2.
\( 1> \) if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is dormant BWP:
\( 2> \) stop the bwp-InactivityTimer of this Serving Cell, if running.
\( 2> \) not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not monitor the PDCCH for the BWP;
\( 2> \) not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2 not report CSI on the BWP, report CSI except aperiodic CSI for the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit SRS on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit on RACH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
\( 2> \) suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) if configured, perform beam failure detection and beam failure recovery for the SCell if beam failure is detected;
