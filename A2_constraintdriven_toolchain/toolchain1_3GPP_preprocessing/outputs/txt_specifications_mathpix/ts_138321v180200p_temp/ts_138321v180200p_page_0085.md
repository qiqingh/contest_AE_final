NOTE 4: Void
NOTE 5: If a HARQ process is configured with cg-RetransmissionTimer and if the BSR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE implementation how to handle the BSR content.
5.4.6 Power Headroom Reporting

The Power Headroom reporting procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with the following information:
- Type 1 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH transmission per activated Serving Cell;
- Type 2 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH and PUCCH transmission on SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity in EN-DC, NE-DC, and NGEN-DC cases);
- Type 3 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for SRS transmission per activated Serving Cell;
- MPE P-MPR: the power backoff to meet the MPE FR2 requirements for a Serving Cell operating on FR2;
- DPC: the adjustment to maximum output power for a given power class for a Serving Cell operating on FR1;
- \( \quad \mathrm{DPC}_{\mathrm{BC}} \) : the adjustment to maximum output power for a given power class for a Band Combination operating on FR1.

RRC controls Power Headroom reporting by configuring the following parameters:
- dpc-Reporting-FRI;
- phr-AssumedPUSCH-Reporting;
- phr-PeriodicTimer;
- phr-ProhibitTimer;
- phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange;
- phr-Type2OtherCell;
- phr-ModeOtherCG;
- multiplePHR;
- mpe-Reporting-FR2;
- mpe-ProhibitTimer;
- mpe-Threshold;
- numberOfN;
- mpe-ResourcePoolToAddModList;
- twoPHRMode.

A Power Headroom Report (PHR) shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:
- phr-ProhibitTimer expires or has expired and the path loss has changed more than phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange dB for at least one RS used as pathloss reference for one activated Serving Cell of any MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC entity when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission;
