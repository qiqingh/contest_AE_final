\( 1> \) if the allocated UL resources can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR which the MAC entity is configured to transmit, plus its subheader, as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1:
\( 2> \) if multiplePHR with value true is configured:
3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with any MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP; and

3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with E-UTRA MAC entity:
\( 4> \) if this MAC entity is configured with twoPHRMode:
\( 5> \) if this Serving Cell is configured with multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN and the MAC entity this Serving Cell belongs to is configured with twoPHRMode:

6> obtain two values of the Type 1 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for NR Serving Cell.
\( 5> \) else if this Serving Cell is configured with multiple TRP PUSCH repetition (i.e., not configured with multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN) and the MAC entity this Serving Cell belongs to is configured with twoPHRMode:
\( 6> \) obtain two values of the Type 1 or the value of Type 3 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for NR Serving Cell.

5> else:
\( 6> \) obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [17] for E-UTRA Serving Cell.

4> else (i.e. this MAC entity is not configured with twoPHRMode):
\( 5> \) if this Serving Cell is configured with multiple TRP PUSCH repetition or multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN and if the MAC entity this Serving Cell belongs to is configured with twoPHRMode:
\( 6> \) if there is at least one real PUSCH transmission at the slot where the PHR MAC CE is transmitted:

\( 6> \) else if there is no real PUSCH transmission at the slot where the PHR MAC CE is transmitted:
\( 7> \) obtain the value of the type 1 power headroom of the reference PUSCH transmission associated with the SRS-ResourceSet with a lower SRS-resourceSetID or the value of the type 3 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213[6] for NR Serving Cell.
\( 5> \) else:
\( 6> \) obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [17] for E-UTRA Serving Cell.

4> if this MAC entity is configured with phr-AssumedPUSCH-Reporting:
\( 5> \) if this MAC entity has UL resources allocated for transmission on this Serving Cell; or
\( 5> \) if the other MAC entity, if configured, has UL resources allocated for transmission on this Serving Cell and phr-ModeOtherCG is set to real by upper layers:
