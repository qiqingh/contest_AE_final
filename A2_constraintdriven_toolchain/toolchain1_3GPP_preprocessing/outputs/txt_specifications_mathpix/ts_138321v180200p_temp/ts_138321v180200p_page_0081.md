- all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure recovery are deactivated (see clause 5.9).

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if one of the following conditions is met:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an SL LBT failure MAC CE that indicates Sidelink consistent LBT failure; or
- all the triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure recovery are cancelled (see clause 5.31.2).

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- the Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE that triggers the SR corresponding to the Random Access procedure has already been cancelled.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for Timing Advance report, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a Timing Advance Report MAC CE (see clause 5.4.8).

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for DSR, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes either a DSR MAC CE or
- all the PDCP SDUs associated with the DSR (see clause 5.4.9); or
- all the PDCP SDUs associated with the DSR have been discarded (see clause 5.4.9).

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for SL-PRS Resource Request, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE (see clause 5.22.1.12).
5.4.5 Buffer Status Reporting

The Buffer Status reporting (BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with information about UL data volume in the MAC entity.

RRC configures the following parameters to control the BSR:
- periodicBSR-Timer;
- retxBSR-Timer;
- logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied,
- logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer;
- logicalChannelSR-Mask;
- logicalChannelGroup, logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext;
- sdt-LogicalChannelSR-DelayTimer;
- additionalBS-TableAllowed.
