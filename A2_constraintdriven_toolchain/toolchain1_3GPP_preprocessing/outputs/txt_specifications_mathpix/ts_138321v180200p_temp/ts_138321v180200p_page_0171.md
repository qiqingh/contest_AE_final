\( 1> \) else (i.e retransmission):
\( 2> \) if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on PDCCH, the configured sidelink grant or the selected sidelink grant is associated to a Sidelink process of which HARQ buffer is empty; or
\( 2> \) if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on PDCCH is not associated to any Sidelink process; or
\( 2> \) if PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for one or more retransmissions of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent:
\( 3> \) ignore the sidelink grant.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) identify the Sidelink process associated with this grant, and for the associated Sidelink process:
\( 4> \) set the SL-PRS resource ID, if SL-PRS is available, within Sidelink transmission information;
\( 4> \) deliver the sidelink grant and the Sidelink transmission information of the MAC PDU and the SLPRS, if available, to the associated Sidelink process;
\( 4> \) instruct the associated Sidelink process to trigger a retransmission.
5.22.1.3.1a Sidelink process not associated with Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool

The Sidelink process is associated with a HARQ buffer.
New transmissions and retransmissions are performed on the resource indicated in the sidelink grant as specified in clause 5.22.1.1 and with the MCS selected as specified in clause 8.1.3.1 of TS 38.214 [7] and clause 5.22.1.1.

If the Sidelink process is configured to perform transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 , the process maintains a counter SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER. For other configurations of the Sidelink process, this counter is not available.

Priority of a MAC PDU and SL-PRS, if available, is determined by the highest priority of the logical channel(s), MAC CE(s) in the MAC PDU or SL-PRS.

If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a new transmission, the Sidelink process shall:
\( 1> \) store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;
\( 1> \) store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
\( 1> \) generate a transmission as described below.
If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a retransmission, the Sidelink process shall:
\( 1> \) store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
\( 1> \) generate a transmission as described below.
To generate a transmission, the Sidelink process shall:
\( 1> \) if there is no uplink transmission; or
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission; or
\( 1> \) if the other MAC entity and the MAC entity are able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission respectively; or
\( 1> \) if there is a MAC PDU to be transmitted for this duration in uplink, except a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer, the MSGA buffer, or prioritized as specified in clause 5.4.2.2, and the sidelink transmission is prioritized over uplink transmission:
