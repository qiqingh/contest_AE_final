1> if the SL-IUC Information reporting has been triggered by an SL-IUC Request MAC CE (and/or an SCI) and not cancelled:
\( 2> \) if the sl-IUC-ReportTimer for the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting is not running:
\( 3> \) start the sl-IUC-ReportTimer.
\( 2> \) if the \( s \)-IUC-ReportTimer for the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting expires:
\( 3> \) cancel the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting.
\( 2> \) else if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and the SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-IUC Information MAC CE and its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.53;
\( 3> \) stop the sl-IUC-ReportTimer for the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting;
\( 3> \) cancel the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting.
5.22.1.10.2 Reception of IUC-Information Reporting

Upon the reception of SL-IUC Information MAC CE from another UE, the MAC entity shall:
1> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC:
\( 2> \) if the SL-IUC Information MAC CE contains a non-preferred resource set and if the UE is configured to use full sensing or partial sensing in the resource pool where the non-preferred resource set is located:
\( 3> \) indicate the received non-preferred resource set to physical layer.
5.22.1.11 TX carrier (re-)selection

The MAC entity shall consider a CBR of a carrier to be one measured by lower layers according to TS 38.215 [24] if CBR measurement results are available, or the corresponding si-DefaultTxConfigIndex configured by upper layers if CBR measurement results are not available.

If the TX carrier (re-)selection is triggered for a Sidelink process according to clause 5.22.1.1, 5.22.1.2 or 5.22.1.3.3, the MAC entity shall:

1> if there is no selected sidelink grant on any carrier allowed for the sidelink logical channel where data is available as indicated by upper layers (TS 38.331 [5] and TS 23.287 [19]):
\( 2> \) for each carrier configured by upper layers associated with the concerned sidelink logical channel:
\( 3> \) if the CBR of the carrier is below sl-threshCBR-FreqReselection associated with the priority of the sidelink logical channel:

NOTE 1: In the case of multiple resource pools configured on a carrier, which specific resource pool is used to determine the CBR of this carrier is up to UE implementation, taking into account of sl-HARQFeedbackEnabled for the sidelink logical channel.

4> consider the carrier as a candidate carrier for TX carrier (re-)selection for the concerned sidelink logical channel.

1> else:
\( 2> \) for each sidelink logical channel, if any, where data is available and that are allowed on the carrier for which Tx carrier (re-)selection is triggered according to clause 5.22.1.1, if the CBR of the carrier is below sl-threshCBR-FreqKeeping associated with priority of the sidelink logical channel, for each sidelink logical channel, if any, where data is available and that are allowed on the carrier for which Tx carrier (re-)selection is triggered according to clause 5.22.1.1:
