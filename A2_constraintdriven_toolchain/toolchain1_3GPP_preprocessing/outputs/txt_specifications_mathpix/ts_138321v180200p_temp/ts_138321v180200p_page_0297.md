6.1.3.79 Multiple Entry PHR with assumed PUSCH MAC CE

The Multiple Entry PHR with assumed PUSCH MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2.

It has a variable size, and includes the bitmap, a Type 2 PH field, an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{IC}} \) field (if reported) and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{c}} \) field for assumed PUSCH (if reported) for SpCell of the other MAC entity; a Type 1 PH field, an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field (if reported) and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) field for assumed PUSCH (if reported) for the PCell. It further includes, in ascending order based on the ServCellIndex, one or multiple of Type X PH fields, octets containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{c}} \) fields (if reported) and octets containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) fields for assumed PUSCH (if reported) for Serving Cells other than PCell indicated in the bitmap. X is either 1 or 3 according to TS 38.213 [6] and TS 36.213 [17].

The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is configured by phr-Type2OtherCell with value true.

A single octet \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH per Serving Cell when the highest ServCellIndex of Serving Cell with configured uplink is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.

The length of the \( E_{k} \) bitmap is based on the total number of Serving Cells, i.e. Serving Cells for which \( C_{1} \) field set to 1 and PCell. A single octet \( E_{k} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells is greater than 0 and less than 9 ; a two octets \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells is greater than 8 and less than 17; a three octets \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells is greater than 16 and less than 25 ; a four octets \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) bitmap is included if the total number of Serving Cells is greater than 24; \( E_{k} \) bitmap is not included if the total number of Serving Cells is zero.

The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a configured grant.

For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) for the PCell are up to UE implementation.

The PHR MAC CEs are defined as follows:
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) : This field indicates the presence of a PH field for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 1 indicates that a PH field for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex i is reported. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 0 indicates that a PH field for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex i is not reported;
- \( E_{k} \) : This field indicates the presence of a \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5, c} \) for assumed PUSCH field of the \( \mathrm{k}^{\text {th }} \) Serving Cell. The Serving Cells for which \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field is set to 1 and PCell are indexed sequentially starting with PCell and followed by other Serving cells in ascending order of ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that a \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) for assumed PUSCH field for the \( \mathrm{k}^{\text {th }} \) Serving Cell is reported. The \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates that a PCMAX, \( 5, \mathrm{c} \) for assumed PUSCH field for the \( k^{\text {th }} \) Serving Cell is not reported. For the E-UTRA Serving Cell, the corresponding \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is set to 0 ;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- V: This field indicates if the PH value is based on a real transmission or a reference format. For Type 1 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUSCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH reference format is used. For Type 2 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUCCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUCCH reference format is used. For Type 3 PH , the V field set to 0 indicates real transmission on SRS and the V field set to 1 indicates that an SRS reference format is used. Furthermore, for Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 PH , the V field set to 0 indicates the presence of the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) field and the MPE field, and the V field set to 1 indicates that the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) field and the MPE field is omitted;
