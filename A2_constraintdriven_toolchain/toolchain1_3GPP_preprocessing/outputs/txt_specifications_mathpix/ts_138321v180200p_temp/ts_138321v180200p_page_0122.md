\( 1> \) perform the Random Access procedure on the active DL BWP of SpCell and active UL BWP of this Serving Cell.

If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching of a Serving Cell, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if there is no ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell; or
\( 1> \) if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5):
\( 2> \) cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for this Serving Cell;
\( 2> \) perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH .
If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching for a Serving Cell(s) or a dormancy SCell group(s) while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to switch BWP or ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, except for the PDCCH reception for BWP switching addressed to the C-RNTI for successful Random Access procedure completion (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5) in which case the UE shall perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH. Upon reception of the PDCCH for BWP switching other than successful contention resolution, if the MAC entity decides to perform BWP switching, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching; if the MAC decides to ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, the MAC entity shall continue with the ongoing Random Access procedure on the Serving Cell.

Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching.

Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell, cancel any triggered consistent LBT failure in this Serving Cell.

The MAC entity shall for each activated Serving Cell configured with bwp-InactivityTimer:
\( 1> \) if the defaultDownlinkBWP-Id is configured, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the defaultDownlinkBWP-Id, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the dormantBWP-Id if configured; or

1> if the UE is neither a RedCap nor an eRedCap UE, and if the defaultDownlinkBWP-Id is not configured, and the active DL BWP is not the initial DownlinkBWP, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the dormantB WP-Id if configured; or
\( 1> \) if the UE is an (e)RedCap UE, and if the defaultDownlinkBWP-Id is not configured, and mitialDownlinkBWPRedCap is not configured, and the active DL BWP is not the initialDownlinkBWP; or

1> if the UE is an (e)RedCap UE, and if the defaultDownlinkBWP-Id is not configured, and mitialDownlinkBWPRedCap is configured, and the active DL BWP is not the initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap:
\( 2> \) if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or uplink grant is received on the active BWP; or
\( 2> \) if a PDCCH addressed to G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI configured for multicast indicating downlink assignment is received on the active BWP; or

2 if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or uplink grant is received for the active BWP; or

2 if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers; or
\( 2> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment for unicast or MBS multicast:
\( 3> \) if there is no ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell; or
3> if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a and 5.1.5):
