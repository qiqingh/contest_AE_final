Figure 6.1.3.4-1: Timing Advance Command MAC CE
6.1.3.4a Absolute Timing Advance Command MAC CE

The Absolute Timing Advance Command MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b.

It has a fixed size and consists of two octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.4a-1):
- Timing Advance Command: This field indicates the index value TA used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the field is 12 bits;
- TI: If two TAGs are configured for the SpCell, this field indicates one of the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If tag2-flag is set to true by upper layers, the field set to 0 indicates the tag2-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag-Id of the SpCell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the tag-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag2-Id of the SpCell. If the SpCell is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

6.1.3.7 Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE

The Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.12.

It has a fixed size of zero bits.
6.1.3.8 Single Entry PHR MAC CE

The Single Entry PHR MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2.
It has a fixed size and consists of two octets defined as follows (figure 6.1.3.8-1):
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
