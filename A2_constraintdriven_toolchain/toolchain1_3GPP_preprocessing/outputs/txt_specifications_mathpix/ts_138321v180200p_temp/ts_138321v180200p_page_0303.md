ETSITS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

for PHR as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a configured grant.

For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{k}} \) field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{k}} \) for the PCell are up to UE implementation.

The two PHs together with two \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{rc}, \mathrm{k}} \) for the Serving Cell configured with multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN are reported if the MAC entity is configured with twoPHRMode, as specified in clause 5.4.6.

The Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP STx2P MAC CEs are defined as follows:
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) : This field indicates the presence of PH field(s) for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 1 indicates that PH field(s) for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex i is reported. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 0 indicates that a PH field for the Serving Cell with ServCellIndex \( i \) is not reported;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- \( \quad V_{k} \) : This field indicates if the PH \( k \) value is based on a real transmission or a reference format for \( k=1,2 \). For Type 1 PH, the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUSCH and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH reference format is used. For Type 2 PH , the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUCCH and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that a PUCCH reference format is used. For Type 3 PH , the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates real transmission on SRS and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that an SRS reference format is used. Furthermore, for type 1 PH of a reported Serving Cell not configured with multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN, the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates the presence of the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) field and the \( \mathrm{MPE}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field, and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) field and \( \mathrm{MPE}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is omitted; for Type 2, and Type 3 PH , the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates the presence of the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) field and the \( \mathrm{MPE}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field, and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field for the Serving Cell set to 1 indicates that the octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) field and the \( \mathrm{MPE}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is omitted;
- Power Headroom \( \mathrm{k}(\mathrm{PH} \mathrm{k}) \) : This field indicates the power headroom level. For PHR with twoPHRmode, if the Serving cell is configured with multipanelSchemeSFN or multipanelSchemeSDM, PH 1 is associated with the first TCI-State or TCI-UL-State for a real or reference PUSCH transmission and PH 2 is associated with the second TCI-State or TCI-UL-State for a real or reference PUSCH transmission, as specified in TS 38.213 clause 7.7.1 [6]; if the Serving cell is configured with multiple TRP PUSCH repetition, PH 1 is associated with the SRSResourceSet with a lower srs-ResourceSetld and PH 2 is associated with the SRS-ResourceSet with a higher srsResourceSetld. PH fields for a Serving Cell are included in ascending order based on k . The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 (the corresponding measured values in dB for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dB for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value associated with \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{k}} \) to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_ 00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by P-MPRc as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field to 1 if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- P \( _{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c},} \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) : If present, this field indicates the configured transmitted power \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{k}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) for the NR Serving Cell and the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) or \( \tilde{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 36.213 [17]) for the E-UTRA Serving Cell used for calculation of the preceding PH k field. For the SpCell of the other MAC entity and a reported Serving Cell not configured with multipanelSchemeSDM or multipanelSchemeSFN, \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) is presented (i.e., the index k is omitted). The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dBm for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
- MPE \( \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{k}} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are
