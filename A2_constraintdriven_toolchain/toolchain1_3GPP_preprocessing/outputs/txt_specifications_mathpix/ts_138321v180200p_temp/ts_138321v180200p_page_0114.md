\( 2> \) if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE and a TRS is indicated for this SCell:
\( 3> \) indicate to lower layers the information regarding the TRS.
\( 2> \) if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or this Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE; or
\( 2> \) if the SCell is configured with sCellState set to activated upon SCell configuration:
\( 3> \) if firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id is not set to dormant BWP:
4> activate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct SCell activation; i.e. apply normal SCell operation including:

5> SRS transmissions on the SCell;
5> CSI reporting for the SCell;
\( 5>\mathrm{PDCCH} \) monitoring on the SCell;
\( 5>\mathrm{PDCCH} \) monitoring for the SCell;
5> PUCCH transmissions on the SCell, if configured.
3> else (i.e. firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id is set to dormant BWP):
\( 4> \) stop the bwp-InactivityTimer of this Serving Cell, if running.
3> activate the DL BWP and UL BWP indicated by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id and firstActiveUplinkBWPId respectively.

2> start or restart the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct SCell activation;
\( 2> \) if the active DL BWP is not the dormant BWP:
\( 3> \) (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant Type 1 associated with this SCell according to the stored configuration, if any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
\( 3> \) trigger PHR according to clause 5.4.6.
1> else if an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or an Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating the SCell; or

1> if the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the activated SCell expires; or
1> if the SCG associated with the activated SCell is deactivated:
\( 2> \) deactivate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6];
\( 2> \) stop the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) stop the bwp-InactivityTimer associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) deactivate any active BWP associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
\( 2> \) clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
\( 2> \) flush all HARQ buffers associated with the SCell;
