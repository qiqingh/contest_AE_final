\( 4> \) select one of the allowed values configured by RRC in sl-ResourceReservePeriodList and set the resource reservation interval, \( P_{\text {rsvp_tx }} \), with the selected value;

4> select the number of HARQ retransmissions from the allowed numbers, if configured by RRC, in \( s l \) MaxTxTransNumPSSCH included in sl-PSSCH-TxConfigList and, if configured by RRC, overlapped in sl-MaxTxTransNumPSSCH indicated in sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList for the highest priority of the logical channel(s) and pending SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier and the CBR measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [24] if CBR measurement results are available or the corresponding sl-DefaultTxConfigIndex configured by RRC if CBR measurement results are not available or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultCBR-PartialSensing configured by RRC if partial sensing is selected and CBR measurement results are not available, or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultCBR-RandomSelection configured by RRC if random selection is selected and CBR measurement results are not available in case the \( s \)-TxPoolExceptional is not used;

NOTE 3A0: The priority of SL-PRS is provided by the UE's own upper layers by implementation within the service layer requirement of the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning.

NOTE 3Aa: For Multi-consecutive slots transmission as specified in clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], during resource (re)selection, leave it to UE implementation, regarding whether to calculate the number of HARQ retransmissions from the allowed numbers based on the number of MCSt transmissions, or the number of slot(s) within Multi-consecutive slots transmission.

NOTE 3Aa0: When transmission is performed on Shared SL-PRS resource pool, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions also corresponds to the number of SL-PRS transmissions.

4> select an amount of frequency resources within the range, if configured by RRC, between \( s l \) MinSubChannelNumPSSCH and sl-MaxSubchannelNumPSSCH included in sl-PSSCH-TxConfigList and, if configured by RRC, overlapped between sl-MinSubChannelNumPSSCH and slMaxSubchannelNumPSSCH indicated in sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList for the highest priority of the logical channel(s) and pending SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier and the CBR measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [24] if CBR measurement results are available or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultTxConfigIndex configured by RRC if CBR measurement results are not available or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultCBR-PartialSensing configured by RRC if partial sensing is selected and CBR measurement results are not available, or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultCBR-RandomSelection configured by RRC if random selection is selected and CBR measurement results are not available in case the \( s \)-TxPoolExceptional is not used;

3> else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
4> select one of the allowed values configured by RRC in \( s l \)-PRS-ResourceReservePeriodList and set the resource reservation interval, \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }} \), with the selected value;

4> select the number of SL-PRS retransmissions from the allowed numbers, if configured by RRC, in \( s \) -PRS-MaxNum-Transmissions included in sl-CBR-SL-PRS-TxConfigList.
\( 3> \) if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is not configured by RRC:

4- if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers:
\( 5> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resource pool which occur within the SL DRX Active time, if configured, as specified in clause 5.28 .2 of the destination UE selected for indicating to the physical layer the SL DRX Active time above, and the pool(s) in which all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled and the resources of which the lowest sub-channel includes intra cell guard band PRBs if sl-transmissionStructureForPSCCHandPSSCH is set to 'contiguousRB' are excluded, if configured, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.
