ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

When the Random Access procedure is initiated on a Serving Cell or for an LTM candidate cell, the MAC entity shall:
1> flush the Msg3 buffer;
1> flush the MSGA buffer;
\( 1> \) set the PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER to 1 ;
\( 1> \) if the Random Access procedure is initiated on a Serving Cell; or
1> if the Random Access procedure is initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell and the PDCCH order indicates preamble initial transmission; or

1> if the Random Access procedure is initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell, which is different from the cell to which the UE performed the last Random Access Preamble transmission, and the PDCCH order indicates preamble re-transmission:

2> set the PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER to 1 ;
1> set the PREAMBLE_BACKOFF to 0 ms ;
\( 1>\operatorname{set} \) POWER_OFFSET_2STEP_RA to 0 dB ;
\( 1> \) if the carrier to use for the Random Access procedure is explicitly signalled:
\( 2> \) select the signalled carrier for performing Random Access procedure;
\( 2> \) set the PCMAX to \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, }, \mathrm{C}} \) of the signalled carrier.
\( 1> \) else if the carrier to use for the Random Access procedure is not explicitly signalled; and
1> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is configured with supplementary uplink as specified in TS \( 38.331[5] \); and

1> if the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL:
\( 2> \) select the SUL carrier for performing Random Access procedure;
\( 2> \) set the PCMAX to \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, }, \mathrm{C}} \) of the SUL carrier.
1> else:
\( 2> \) select the NUL carrier for performing Random Access procedure;
\( 2> \) set the PCMAX to \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX }, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}} \) of the NUL carrier.
NOTE 4: Void.
1> perform the BWP operation as specified in clause 5.15, except when the Random Access procedure is initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell;

1> select the set of Random Access resources applicable to the current Random Access procedure according to clause 5.1.1b;
\( 1> \) if the Random Access procedure is initiated by PDCCH order and if the \( r a \)-PreambleIndex explicitly provided by PDCCH is not 0 b 000000 ; or

1> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) and the Random Access Resources for SI request have been explicitly provided by RRC; or
\( 1> \) if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery (as specified in clause 5.17) and if the contention-free Random Access Resources for beam failure recovery request for 4 -step RA type have been explicitly provided by RRC for the BWP selected for Random Access procedure; or

1> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for reconfiguration with sync and if the contention-free Random Access Resources for 4-step RA type have been explicitly provided in rach-ConfigDedicated for the BWP selected for Random Access procedure; or
