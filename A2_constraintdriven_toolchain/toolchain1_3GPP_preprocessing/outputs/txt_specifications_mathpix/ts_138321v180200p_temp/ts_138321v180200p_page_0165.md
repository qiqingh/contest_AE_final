\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is not transmitted (ie initial transmission or retransmission) in any of the resources for this MAC PDU that are associated with the sidelink process for Multi-consecutive slots transmission due to the Sidelink LBT failure:

NOTE 2: If the remaining PDB is not met, it is left for UE implementation whether to perform transmission(s) corresponding to single MAC PDU or sidelink resource reselection.

NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation whether to trigger the TX resource (re-)selection due to the latency requirement of the MAC CEs triggered according to clause 5.22.1.7 and clause 5.22.1.10.1.
\( 2> \) if multiple carrier frequencies are configured:
\( 3> \) trigger the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure as specified in clause 5.22.1.11.
NOTE 3a: It is up to UE implementation to avoid triggering the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure again if it has just performed TX carrier (re-)selection procedure.
\( 2> \) clear the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process, if available;
\( 2> \) trigger the TX resource (re-)selection.
NOTE 4: Void.
NOTE 5: Void.
5.22.1.2a Re-evaluation and Pre-emption

A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity or for a SL-PRS transmission is re-evaluated by physical layer at \( T_{3} \) before the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first time as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7].

A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a prior SCI for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity or for a SL-PRS transmission could be checked for pre-emption by physical layer at \( T_{3} \) before the slot where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7].

NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation to re-evaluate or pre-empt before ' \( \mathrm{m}-T_{3} \) ' or after ' \( \mathrm{m}-T_{3} \) ' but before ' m '. For re-evaluation, \( m \) is the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first time as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214. For pre-emption, \( m \) is the slot where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214.

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 or Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2 to transmit using pool(s) of resources in a carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21] based on sensing or random selection the MAC entity shall for each Sidelink process or for each SL-PRS transmission:
\( 1> \) if a resource( \( s \) ) of the selected sidelink grant which has not been identified by a prior SCI is indicated for reevaluation by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1 . 4 of TS 38.214 [7];
\( 2> \) remove the resource(s) from the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process or SL-PRS transmission;
\( 2> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 3> \) randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8-1-4 of TS 38.214 [7] for either the removed resource or the dropped resource, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission, if available, by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources, and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9];
\( 2> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 3> \) randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.2.4 of TS 38.214 [7] for either the removed resource or the dropped resource,
