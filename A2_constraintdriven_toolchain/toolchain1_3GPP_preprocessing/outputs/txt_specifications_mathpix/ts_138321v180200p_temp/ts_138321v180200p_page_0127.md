\( 2> \) if beamFailureDetectionTimer, beamFailureInstanceMaxCount, or any of the reference signals used for beam failure detection is reconfigured by upper layers or by the BFD-RS Indication MAC CE associated with a BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell; or
\( 2> \) if the reference signal(s) associated with a BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell used for beam failure detection is changed:
\( 3> \) set BFI_COUNTER of the BFD-RS set to 0 .
\( 2> \) if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI indicating uplink grant for a new transmission is received for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the Enhanced BFR MAC CE or Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure recovery information of this BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell:
\( 3> \) set BFI_COUNTER of the BFD-RS set to 0;
3> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed for this BFD-RS set and cancel all the triggered BFRs of this BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell.
\( 2> \) if the Serving Cell is SCell and the SCell is deactivated as specified in clause 5.9:
3> set BFI_COUNTER of each BFD-RS set of SCell to 0;
3> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed and cancel all the triggered BFRs of all BFD-RS sets of the Serving Cell.

1> else:
\( 2> \) if beam failure instance indication has been received from lower layers:
3> start or restart the beamFailureDetectionTimer;
\( 3> \) increment BFI_COUNTER by 1;
3> if BFI_COUNTER>= beamFailureInstanceMaxCount:
4> if the Serving Cell is SCell:
\( 5> \) trigger a BFR for this Serving Cell;
4> else if the Serving Cell is PSCell and, the SCG is deactivated:
\( 5> \) if beam failure of the PSCell has not been indicated to upper layers since the SCG was deactivated or since the deactivated SCG was last reconfigured with BFD-RS:
\( 6> \) indicate beam failure of the PSCell to upper layers.
NOTE: After beam failure is indicated to upper layers, the UE may stop the beamFailureDetectionTimer and lower layer beam failure indication while BFI_COUNTER>= beamFailurelnstanceMaxCount for the deactivated SCG.

4> else:
5> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell;
\( 5> \) if beam failure is detected for an NCR-MT:
\( 6> \) indicate to NCR-Fwd to cease forwarding.
\( 2> \) if the beamFailureDetectionTimer expires; or
\( 2> \) if beamFailureDetectionTimer, beamFailureInstanceMaxCount, or any of the reference signals used for beam failure detection is reconfigured by upper layers associated with this Serving Cell; or
\( 2> \) if the reference signal(s) associated with this Serving Cell used for beam failure detection is changed:
3> set BFI_COUNTER to 0 .
