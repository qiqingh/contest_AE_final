- Power Headroom (PH): This field indicates the power headroom level. The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 (the corresponding measured values in dB for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dB for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
- P: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than PMPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by \( \mathrm{P}^{-} \mathrm{MPR}_{\mathrm{c}} \) as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied; the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) or \( \tilde{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 36.213 [17]) for the E-UTRA Serving Cell used for calculation of the preceding PH field. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dBm for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c} \text { for assumed PUSCH: If present, this field indicates the } \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c} \text {, for assumed }} \mathrm{PUSCH} \text { (as specified in TS }} 38.213[6]) \) for the NR Serving Cell. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in [Table 6.1.3.8-2] (the corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11];
- MPE: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the P field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the P field is set to \( 0, \mathrm{R} \) bits are present instead.
