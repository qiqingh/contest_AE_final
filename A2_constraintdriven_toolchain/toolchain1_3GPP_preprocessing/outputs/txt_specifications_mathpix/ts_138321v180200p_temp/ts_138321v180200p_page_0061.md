\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a MSGB-RNTI and the Random Access procedure is not yet successfully completed (see clause 5.1.4a); or
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI for MBS broadcast; or

1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a Multicast MCCH-RNTI for MBS multicast; or

1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast and HARQ feedback is disabled for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI or the corresponding G-CS-RNTI, as specified in clause 18 of TS 38.213 [6]; or

1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast and NACK only HARQ feedback is used for this G-RNTI or G-CSRNTI or the corresponding G-CS-RNTI and the data for this TB is successfully decoded and the transmission is not the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink assignment was (re-)initialised; or
\( 1> \) if the timeAlignmentTimer, associated with the TAG containing the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or expired, and the Serving Cell is not configured with two TAGs, and if the cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer, if configured, is not running; or

1> if the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted is configured with two TAGs and if the timeAlignmentTimer of the TAG, associated with the TCI state(s) used for transmitting the HARQ feedback, is stopped or expired:
\( 2> \) not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.
\( 1> \) else if the HARQ process is configured with disabled HARQ feedback:
2 if harq-FeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is configured with value true and the transmission is the first transmission on the configured downlink assignment after activation of the configured downlink assignment:

3> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.
\( 2> \) else:
3> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.
1> else:
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.
The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission.

NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size different from the last TB size signalled for this TB , the UE behavior is left up to UE implementation.
5.3.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing

The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.5a.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for MAC entity's G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or by the configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast containing an LCID or eLCID which is not configured, the MAC entity shall at least:
\( 1> \) discard the received subPDU.
