Figure 6.2.3-1: MAC RAR
6.2.3a MAC payload for MSGB

The fallbackRAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3a-1, and consists of the following fields:
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- TI: If two TAGs are configured for the SpCell, this field indicates one of the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If tag2-flag is set to true by upper layers, the field set to 0 indicates the tag2-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag-Id of the SpCell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the tag-Id and the field set to 1 indicates the tag2-Id of the SpCell. If the SpCell is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead;
- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates the index value \( T_{A} \) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;
- UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used on the uplink in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27 bits;
- Temporary C-RNTI: The Temporary C-RNTI field indicates the temporary identity that is used by the MAC entity during Random Access. The size of the Temporary C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The fallbackRAR is octet aligned.
