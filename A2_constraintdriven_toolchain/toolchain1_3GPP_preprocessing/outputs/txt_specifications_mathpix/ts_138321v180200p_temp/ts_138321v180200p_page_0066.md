NOTE 3: If the MAC entity receives a grant in a Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or determines a grant as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload and if the MAC entity also receives an overlapping grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, requiring concurrent transmissions on the SpCell, the MAC entity may choose to continue with either the grant for its RA-RNTI/Temporary C-RNTI/MSGB-RNTI/the MSGA payload transmission or the grant for its CRNTI or CS-RNTI.

NOTE 4: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for configured uplink grants.

NOTE 5: If \( c g \)-RetransmissionTimer is not configured, a HARQ process is not shared between different configured grant configurations in the same BWP.

For the MAC entity configured with lch-basedPrioritization, priority of an uplink grant is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5-4.3.1.2. The priority of an uplink grant for which no data for logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than either the priority of an uplink grant for which data for any logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU or the priority of the logical channel triggering an SR.

For the MAC entity configured with lch-basedPrioritization, if the corresponding PUSCH transmission of a configured uplink grant is cancelled by CI-RNTI as specified in clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [6] or cancelled by a high PHY-priority PUCCH transmission as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6], this configured uplink grant is considered as a deprioritized uplink grant. If this de-prioritized uplink grant is configured with autonomousTx, the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running. If this deprioritized uplink grant is configured with autonomousTx, the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running.

When the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, for each uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity and whose associated PUSCH can be transmitted by lower layers, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if this uplink grant is received in a Random Access Response (i.e in a MAC RAR or fallback RAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI, or is determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload:
\( 2> \) consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant.
\( 1> \) else if this uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI \( =1 \) or C-RNTI:
\( 2> \) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and
\( 2> \) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
\( 3> \) consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
\( 3> \) consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
\( 3> \) consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-prioritized SR transmission(s), except for the SR transmission(s) whose simultaneous transmission is allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneous PUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup;

3> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant configured with autonomous \( T x \) whose PUSCH has already started:

4> stop the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
