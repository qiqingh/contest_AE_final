It has a fixed size and consists of two octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1 3.21-1):
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- Tedia: This field indicates the value \( (0,1, \ldots, 2047) \) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that MAC entity indicates (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). The length of the field is 11 bits.

6.1.3.22 Guard Symbols MAC CEs

The Guard Symbols MAC CEs (i.e. Provided Guard Symbols MAC CE and Desired Guard Symbols MAC CE) for Case-1 timing mode are identified by the MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b for DL-SCH and in Table 6.2.1-2b for UL-SCH.

It has fixed size and consists of four octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.22-1):
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- Sub-carrier spacing (SCS): This field indicates the subcarrier spacing used as reference for the guard spacing. The length of this field is 2bits. The values for the SCS field are shown in Table 6.1.3.22-2;
- Number of Guard Symbols ( \( \mathrm{NmbGS}_{1} \) ): This field indicates the number of guard symbols for the switching scenarios shown in Table 5.18.19-1. The number of guard symbols can take values within the range of 0 to 4 . Higher values 5 to 7 are reserved.
