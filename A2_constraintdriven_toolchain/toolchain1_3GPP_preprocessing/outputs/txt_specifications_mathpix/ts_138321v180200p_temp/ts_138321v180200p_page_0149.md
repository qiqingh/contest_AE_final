NOTE 3Ab: When there are both SL data available in the logical channel(s) and SL-PRS pending for transmission, the resources are selected based on the shorter one of the corresponding remaining PDB and the corresponding remaining SL-PRS delay budget.
\( 5> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resource pool as specified in clause 5.28.2, according to the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s).

4> else:
\( 5> \) if sl-NRPSSCH-EUTRA-ThresRSRP-List is configured by the RRC:
6> when SCS of NR SL is (pre-)configured as \( \mu=0 \) :
\( 7> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier.
\( 6> \) when SCS of NR SL is (pre-)configured as \( \mu=1 \) :
7> randomly select the time and frequency resources in the first of NR SL slots overlapping with an LTE SL subframe for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier.

5> else if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] which occur within the SL DRX Active time, if configured, as specified in clause 5.28 .2 of the destination UE selected for indicating to the physical layer the SL DRX Active time above, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.
\( 5> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
6> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by physical layer as clasue 8.2 .4 of TS 38.214 [7] as specified in clause 5.28 .2 , according to the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s).

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and preferred resource set is not received from a UE:
\( 4> \) if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers:
5> if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
6> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources pool excluding all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled and the resources of which the lowest sub-channel includes intra cell guard band PRBs if sl-transmissionStructureForPSCCHandPSSCH is set to 'contiguousRB' are excluded, if configured, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SLPRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.
\( 5> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
6> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resource pool which as specified in clause 5.28 .2 , according to the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s).
