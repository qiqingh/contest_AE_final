1> else if this SL-PRS transmission is associated to broadcast or groupcast:
\( 2> \) if the destination ID in the corresponding SCI is equal to the UE's destination layer-2 ID
3> instruct the physical layer to perform SL-PRS reception on the SL-PRS transmission occasion.
5.23 SL-BCH data transfer
5.23.1 SL-BCH data transmission

When instructed to send SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from SBCCH;
1> deliver the MAC PDU to the physical layer and instruct it to generate a transmission.
5.23.2 SL-BCH data reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) receive and attempt to decode the SL-BCH;
1> if a TB on the SL-BCH has been successfully decoded:
\( 2> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
5.24 Handling of PRS Processing Window

When PPW is activated and PRS has higher priority than DL channel and signals, for the affected symbols within the PPW according to clause 5.1.6.5 in TS 38.214 [7], the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the ra-ResponseWindow or the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer or the msgB-ResponseWindow is running:
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH as specified in clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.5.
1> else:
\( 2> \) not receive DL-SCH;
\( 2> \) not receive PDCCH.
5.25 Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request

If the UE is configured with pre-configured positioning measurement gap and the request of the activation/deactivation of the positioning measurement gap by UL MAC CE, the UE may request the network to activate or deactivate the Positioning measurement gap with UL MAC CE for Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request in clause 6.1.3.40.

The MAC entity shall, when triggered by the upper layer to send Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request, cancel the triggered Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request, if any and trigger another Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request according to the upper layer's request.

The MAC entity shall,
1>if Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE has been triggered, and not cancelled:
\( 2> \) if indication from upper layer has been received that the triggered Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE should be cancelled; or
