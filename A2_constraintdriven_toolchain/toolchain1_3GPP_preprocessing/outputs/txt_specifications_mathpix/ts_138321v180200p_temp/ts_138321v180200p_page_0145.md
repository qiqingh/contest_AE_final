3> store the configured sidelink grant;
3> trigger configured grant confirmation for the configured sidelink grant;
\( 3> \) initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine the set of PSCCH duration(s) and the corresponding SL-PRS occasion for the transmission of SL-PRS.
\( 2> \) else if the PDCCH content indicates the configured Type 2 deactivation for a configured sidelink grant:
3> trigger configured grant confirmation for the configured sidelink grant.
If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 to transmit or Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2 using pool(s) of resources in one carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21] based on full sensing, or partial sensing, or random selection or any combination(s); Or if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 to transmit using pool(s) of resources in multiple carriers as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] based on full sensing, or partial sensing, or random selection or any combination(s), the MAC entity shall for each Sidelink process:

NOTE 0A: For SL-PRS transmission by Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2 on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, partial sensing is not supported.

NOTE 1: If the MAC entity is configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 or Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2 to transmit using a pool of resources in one carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21]; Or if the MAC entity is configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 transmit using pools of resources in multiple carriers as indicated in TS 38.331 [5], the MAC entity can create a selected sidelink grant on the pool of resources based on random selection, or partial sensing, or full sensing only after releasing configured sidelink grant(s), if any.

NOTE 2: For each carrier configured by upper layers associated with the concerned sidelink logical channel, the MAC entity expects that PSFCH is always configured by RRC for at least one pool of resources in \( s / \) TxPoolSelectedNormal and for the resource pool in sl-TxPoolExceptional in case that at least a logical channel configured with sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to enabled.

NOTE 2A: For the transmission of Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE, the MAC entity selects the TX pool of resource where the IUC resource set is required. For the transmission of Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE, the MAC entity selects the TX pool of resource where the IUC resource set is located.

NOTE 2B: For dynamic co-channel coexistence of LTE sidelink and NR sidelink, when the same TB or different TBs are transmitted on the NR SL slots overlapping with the LTE SL subframe, it is up to UE implementation how to avoid transmitting NR PSCCH/PSSCH only in the subsequent NR SL slot overlapping with an LTE SL subframe for NR PSCCH/PSSCH transmissions of 30 kHz SCS.

1> if the MAC entity has selected to create a selected sidelink grant corresponding to transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs, and SL data is available in a logical channel; or

1> if the MAC entity has selected to create a selected sidelink grant corresponding to transmission(s) of multiple SL-PRS(s), which have been triggered by the upper layer or by the reception of a SCI from a peer UE:

NOTE 2B1: The multiplicity/singularity of SL-PRS transmission and the reservation period for multiple SL-PRS transmission is determined by the UE's own upper layers by implementation within the service layer requirement for the Ranging/Sidelink positioning.
\( 2> \) if the MAC entity has not selected a pool of resources allowed for the logical channel or SL-PRS transmission:
\( 3> \) if single carrier frequency is configured:
4> if SL data is available in the logical channel for NR sidelink discovery:
\( 5> \) if \( s \) l-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon is configured according to TS 38.331 [5]:

6> select the sl-DiscTxPoolSelected configured in sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWPDiscPoolConfigCommon for the transmission of NR sidelink discovery message.
