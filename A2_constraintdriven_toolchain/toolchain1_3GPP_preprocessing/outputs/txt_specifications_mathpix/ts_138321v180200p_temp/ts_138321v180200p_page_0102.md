- drx-InactivityTimerPTM: the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new DL broadcast transmission for the MAC entity;
- drx-LongCycleStartOffsetPTM: the long DRX cycle drx-LongCycle-PTM and drx-StartOffset-PTM which defines the subframe where the DRX cycle starts.

When broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the Active Time includes the time while:
- drx-onDurationTimerPTM or drx-InactivityTimerPTM for this G-RNTI is running.

When broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for this G-RNTI:
\( 1> \) if \( [(\mathrm{SFN} \times 10)+ \) subframe number \( ] \) modulo \( ( \) drx-LongCycle-PTM \( )= \) drx-StartOffset-PTM
\( 2> \) start drx-onDurationTimerPTM after drx-SlotOffsetPTM from the beginning of the subframe.
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is in Active Time for this G-RNTI:
◇ monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH indicates a DL transmission for MBS broadcast:
3> start or restart drx-InactivityTimerPTM in the first symbol after the end of the PDCCH reception.
NOTE: If a cell is configured for MBS broadcast reception, the SFN of this cell is used to calculate the DRX duration of MBS broadcast on this cell.
5.7b Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for MBS Multicast

For MBS multicast, the MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality per G-RNTI or per G-CSRNTI that controls the UE's PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity's G-RNTI(s) and G-CS-RNTI(s) as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. When in RRC_CONNECTED, if multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CSRNTI, the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI discontinuously using the multicast DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity monitors the PDCCH for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. When in RRC_INACTIVE, if the UE is configured to receive multicast in RRC_INACTIVE and multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI discontinuously using the multicast DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity monitors the PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The multicast DRX operation specified in this clause is performed independently for each G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI and independently from the DRX operation specified in clauses 5.7 and 5.7a.

RRC controls multicast DRX operation per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI by configuring the following parameters:
- drx-onDurationTimerPTM: the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
- drx-SlotOffsetPTM : the delay before starting the drx-onDurationTimerPTM;
- drx-InactivityTimerPTM: the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new DL multicast transmission for the MAC entity;
- drx-LongCycleStartOffsetPTM: the long DRX cycle drx-LongCycle-PTM and drx-StartOffset-PTM which defines the subframe where the long DRX cycle starts;
- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM (per DL HARQ process for MBS multicast): the maximum duration until a DL multicast retransmission is received;
- drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM (per DL HARQ process for MBS multicast): the minimum duration before a DL multicast assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.

The following MAC timer is used for DRX operation in a non-terrestrial network:
- HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN (per DL HARQ process for MBS multicast): the minimum duration before a DL multicast assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.

When multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the Active Time includes the time while:
