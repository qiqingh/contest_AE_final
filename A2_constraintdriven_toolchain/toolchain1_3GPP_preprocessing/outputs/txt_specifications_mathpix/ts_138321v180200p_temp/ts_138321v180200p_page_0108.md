ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)
- periodicity: periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
- nrofHARQ-Processes: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
- harq-ProcID-Offset: offset of HARQ process for configured grant configured with cg-RetransmissionTimer for operation with shared spectrum channel access;
- harq-ProcID-Offset2: offset of HARQ process for configured grant not configured with cgRetransmissionTimer.

RRC configures the following parameter when retransmissions on configured uplink grant is configured:
- cg-RetransmissionTimer: the duration after a configured grant (re)transmission of a HARQ process when the UE shall not autonomously retransmit that HARQ process;
- cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer: the duration after a configured grant (re)transmission of a HARQ process of the initial CG-SDT transmission with CCCH message when the UE shall not autonomously retransmit the HARQ process;
- cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer: the duration after a configured grant (re)transmission of a HARQ process of the initial transmission of RACH-less handover and RACH-less LTM cell switch when the UE shall not autonomously retransmit the HARQ process.

RRC configures the following parameter when a multi-PUSCH configured grant is configured:
- nrofSIotsInCG-Period: the number of configured uplink grants in a periodicity of a multi-PUSCH configured grant.

RRC configures the following parameter when UTO-UCI (as specified in clause 9.3 in TS 38.213 [6]) is configured for a configured grant:
- nrofBitsInUTO-UCI: number of bits in a UTO-UCI bitmap.

For a configured uplink grant, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if its associated configured grant is configured with UTO-UCI and it has not been indicated to the lower layers as unused for PUSCH transmission; or
\( 1> \) if its associated configured grant is not configured with UTO-UCI:
\( 2> \) if it is associated with a multi-PUSCH configured grant and meets the validity conditions specified in the clause 6.1 in TS 38.214 [7]; or

2 if it is not associated with a multi-PUSCH configured grant:
\( 3> \) consider it available for use.
The MAC entity shall not include the UL-SCH resource of a configured uplink grant not available for use in its procedures (e.g. in clause 5.4.4).

For a configured grant configured with UTO-UCI, the MAC entity determines if a configured uplink grant which is within the subsequent nrofBitsInUTO-UCI valid occasions of its associated configured grant configuration is going to be used for PUSCH transmission by considering at least the amount of buffered data that can be transmitted on the available occasions of the associated configured grant and other available UL-SCH resources. Upon this determination, the MAC entity sends an indication to lower layers, for use in the procedure for reporting UTO-UCI.

Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1 for a BWP of a Serving Cell by upper layers, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) store the uplink grant provided by upper layers as a configured uplink grant for the indicated BWP of the Serving Cell;
\( 1> \) initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant to start in the symbol according to timeDomainOffset, timeReferenceSFN, and S (derived from SLIV or provided by startSymbol as specified in TS 38.214 [7]), and to reoccur with periodicity.

If cg-SDT-PeriodicityExt (as defined in TS 38.331 [5]) is not configured, after an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the configured uplink grant, or the first
