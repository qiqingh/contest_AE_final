Figure 6.1.3.49-2: Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE with the highest ServCellindex of Serving Cell with configured uplink is equal to or higher than 8
6.1.3.50 Enhanced Single Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE

The Enhanced Single Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.

The two PHs together with one \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, }, \mathrm{C}} \) for the Serving Cell are reported if UE is configured with twoPHRMode with the multiple TRP PUSCH repetition feature is configured.

It has a fixed size and consists of three octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.50-1):
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- Power Headroom i (PH i): This field indicates the power headroom level, where PH 1 is associated with the SRSResourceSet with a lower srs-ResourceSetld and PH 2 is associated with the SRS-ResourceSet with a higher srsResourceSetld. PH fields for a Serving Cell are included in ascending order based on i . The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 (the corresponding measured values in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- P: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than PMPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by P-MPRc as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- V: This field indicates if the PH value for the corresponding TRP is based on a real transmission or a reference format. For Type 1 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUSCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH reference format is used;
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{\mathrm{c}} \text { : }} \) This field indicates the \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5 \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) used for calculation of the preceding PH fields. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- MPE: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the P field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the P field is set to \( 0, \mathrm{R} \) bits are present instead.

6.1.3.51 Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE

The Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.

It has a variable size, and includes the bitmaps, a Type 2 PH field and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}} \) field (if reported) for SpCell of the other MAC entity, a Type 1 PH field and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field
