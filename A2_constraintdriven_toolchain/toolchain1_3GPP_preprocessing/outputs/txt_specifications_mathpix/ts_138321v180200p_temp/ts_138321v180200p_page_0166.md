ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

according to the selected number of SL-PRS retransmissions and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.2 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 2> \) replace the removed or dropped resource(s) by the selected resource(s) for the selected sidelink grant.
\( 1> \) if any resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a prior SCI is indicated for preemption by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7]:
\( 2> \) remove the resource(s) from the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process;
\( 2> \) if one or multiple SL DRX is configured:
\( 3> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 4> \) randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources later than the resources for either the removed resource or the dropped resource indicated by a prior SCI, from the resource indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] which occur within the SL DRX active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination UE selected for indicating to the physical layer the SL DRX active time above, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission, if available, and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 4> \) randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8-1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] for either the removed resource or the dropped resource, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission, if available, and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 3> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
4 randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.2.4 of TS 38.214 [7] for either the removed resource or the dropped resource, according to the selected number of SL-PRS retransmissions and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

NOTE 2: If retransmission resource(s) cannot be selected by ensuring that the resource(s) can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI, how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources.
\( 2> \) replace the removed or dropped resource(s) by the selected resource(s) for the selected sidelink grant.
NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation to reselect any pre-selected but not reserved resource(s) other than the resource(s) indicated for pre-emption or re-evaluation by the physical layer during reselection triggered by re-evaluation or pre-emption indicated by the physical layer.

NOTE 4: It is up to UE implementation whether to set the resource reservation interval in the re-selected resource to replace pre-empted resource.

NOTE 5: It is up to UE implementation whether to trigger resource reselection due to de-prioritization as specified in clause 16.2.4 of TS 38.213 [6], clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] and clause 5.22.1.3.1a.
