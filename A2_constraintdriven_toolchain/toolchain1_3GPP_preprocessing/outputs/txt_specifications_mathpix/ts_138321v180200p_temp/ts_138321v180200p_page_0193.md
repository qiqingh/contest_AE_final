\( 2> \) if the pre-configured measurement gap indicated in the Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE has already been activated/deactivated according to clause 5.18.20:

3> cancel the triggered Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE.
2 if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and these UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE according to the upper layer's request;
\( 3> \) cancel triggered Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE.
\( 2> \) else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request for Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE as specified in clause 5.4.4.
5.26 Positioning SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE
5.26.1 General

Periodic and semi-persistent Positioning SRS with or without positioning SRS bandwidth aggregation can be configured for Positioning SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE.

SRS for positioning Tx frequency hopping as in clause 5.32 can also be configured for Positioning SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE.

The MAC entity shall,
\( 1> \) if the TA of the configured Positioning SRS is valid according to clause 5.26.2, and the conditions for positioning SRS transmission in clause 7.3.1 of TS 38.213 [6] and clause 6.2.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] are satisfied:
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured with UTW and the UplinkTimeWindowTimer is running according to clause 5.32; or
\( 2> \) if the UE is not configured with UTW:
3> instruct to the lower layer according to TS 38.214 [7] to transmit Positioning Periodic SRS or SemiPersistent SRS that is activated according to clause 5.18.17.
5.26.2 TA validation for SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE

RRC configures the following parameters for validation for SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE:
- inactivePosSRS-RSRP-ChangeThreshold: RSRP threshold for the increase/decrease of RSRP for time alignment validation.

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the UE receives configuration for SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE:
\( 2> \) store the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference with the current RSRP value of the downlink pathloss reference as in TS 38.331 [5].

1> else if the UE is configured with SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE:
\( 2> \) if Timing Advance Command MAC CE is received as in clause 5.2, or;
\( 2> \) if Timing Advance Command or Absolute Timing Advance Command is received for Random Access procedure that is successfully completed:
