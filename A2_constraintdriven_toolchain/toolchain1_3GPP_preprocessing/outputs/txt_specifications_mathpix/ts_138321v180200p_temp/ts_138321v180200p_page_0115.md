\( 2> \) cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for the SCell.
\( 1> \) if PDCCH on the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or downlink assignment; or
1> if PDCCH on the Serving Cell scheduling the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or a downlink assignment for the activated SCell; or

1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers; or
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:
\( 2> \) restart the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the SCell.
\( 1> \) if the SCell is deactivated:
\( 2> \) not transmit SRS on the SCell;
\( 2> \) not report CSI for the SCell;
\( 2> \) not transmit on UL-SCH on the SCell;
\( 2> \) not transmit on RACH on the SCell;
\( 2> \) not monitor the PDCCH on the SCell;
\( 2> \) not monitor the PDCCH for the SCell;
\( 2> \) not transmit PUCCH on the SCell;
\( 2> \) if the SCell is configured as a scheduled cell in MC-DCI-SetOfCells and with the search space for DCI to schedule multiple cells (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) of the same searchSpaceld as the serving cell in which MC-DCI-SetOfCells containing the SCell is configured:

3> not monitor the PDCCH for scheduling multiple cells (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) for the set of cells in MC-DCI-SetOfCells including the SCell.

When the measurement reporting for fast unknown SCell activation is configured by RRC, the MAC entity shall:
1> if SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or an Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the SCell(s):
\( 2> \) if SCell(s) was deactivated prior to receiving this SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or this Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE:
\( 3> \) indicate to upper layers SCell(s) activation indication.
HARQ feedback for the MAC PDU containing SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE shall not be impacted by PCell, PSCell and PUCCH SCell interruptions due to SCell activation/deactivation in TS 38.133 [11].

When SCell is deactivated, the ongoing Random Access procedure on the SCell, if any, is aborted.
5.10 Activation/Deactivation of PDCP duplication

If one or more DRBs are configured with PDCP duplication, the network may activate and deactivate the PDCP duplication for all or a subset of associated RLC entities for the configured DRB(s).

The PDCP duplication for the configured \( \operatorname{DRB}(s) \) is activated and deactivated by:
- receiving the Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.11;
- receiving the Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.32;
- indication by RRC.
