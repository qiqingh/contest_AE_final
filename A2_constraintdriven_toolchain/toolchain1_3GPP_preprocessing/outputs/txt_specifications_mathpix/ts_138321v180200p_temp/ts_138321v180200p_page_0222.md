6.1.3.9 Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE

The Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2.
It has a variable size, and includes the bitmap, a Type 2 PH field and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{IC}} \) field (if reported) for SpCell of the other MAC entity, a Type 1 PH field and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field (if reported) for the PCell. It further includes, in ascending order based on the ServCellIndex, one or multiple of Type X PH fields and octets containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}} \) fields (if reported) for Serving Cells other than PCell indicated in the bitmap. X is either 1 or 3 according to TS 38.213 [6] and TS 36.213 [17].

The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is configured by phr-Type2OtherCell with value true.

A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH per Serving Cell when the highest ServCellIndex of Serving Cell with configured uplink is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.

The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a configured grant.

For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) for the PCell are up to UE implementation.

The PHR MAC CEs are defined as follows:
