clause 7.7.1 [6]. PH fields for a Serving Cell are included in ascending order based on k . The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 (the corresponding measured values in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value associated with \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{r}, \mathrm{k}, \mathrm{k}} \) to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by P-MPRc as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the \( P_{k} \) field to 1 if the corresponding \( P_{C M A X, J, c, k} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- \( V_{k} \) : This field indicates if the PH value for the corresponding TRP is based on a real transmission or a reference format for PH k. For Type 1 PH, the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates real transmission on PUSCH and the \( \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH reference format is used;
- P \( _{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) : This field indicates the configured transmitted power \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } \sqrt{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) used for calculation of the preceding PH k field. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- \( \mathrm{MPE}_{\mathrm{k}} \) : If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is set to 1 , this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field is set to \( 0, \mathrm{R} \) bits are present instead.

6.1.3.82 Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP STx2P MAC CE

The Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP STx2P MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.

It has a variable size, and includes the bitmaps, a Type 2 PH field and an octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}} \) field (if reported) for SpCell of the other MAC entity, one or multiple Type 1 PH fields and one or multiple octets containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{k}} \) fields (if reported) for the PCell. It further includes, in ascending order based on the ServCellIndex, one or multiple of Type 1 PH fields and one or multiple octets containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{k}} \) fields (if reported) or one Type 3 PH field with one octet containing the associated \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) field (if reported) for Serving Cells other than PCell indicated in the bitmap for indicating the presence of \( \mathrm{PH}(\mathrm{s}) \).

The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is configured by phr-Type2OtherCell with value true.

A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of \( \mathrm{PH}(\mathrm{s}) \) per Serving Cell when the highest ServCellIndex of Serving Cell with configured uplink is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.

The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE
