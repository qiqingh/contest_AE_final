5.13 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data

When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI or by the configured downlink assignment, containing a Reserved LCID or eLCID value, or an LCID or eLCID value the MAC Entity does not support, the MAC entity shall at least:
