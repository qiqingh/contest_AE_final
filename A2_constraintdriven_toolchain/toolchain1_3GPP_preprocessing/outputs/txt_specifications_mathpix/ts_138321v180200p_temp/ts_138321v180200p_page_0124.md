5.15.2 Sidelink

In addition to clause 16 of TS 38.213 [6], this clause specifies requirements on BWP operation for sidelink.
The MAC entity is configured with at most a single SL BWP per sidelink carrier where sidelink transmission and reception are performed.

For a BWP, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the BWP is activated:
\( 2> \) transmit SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) transmit S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) transmit PSCCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) transmit SL-PRS on the BWP;
\( 2> \) transmit SL-SCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) receive PSFCH on the BWP , if configured;
\( 2> \) receive S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) receive SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) receive PSCCH on the BWP ;
\( 2> \) receive SL-PRS on the BWP;
\( 2> \) receive SL-SCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) transmit PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) (re-)initialize any suspended configured sidelink grant of configured grant Type 1.
\( 2> \) if \( s l \)-lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig is configured:
\( 3> \) set \( S L_{-} L B T_{-} \)COUNTER to 0 for all RB sets in the SLBWP;
\( 3> \) monitors SL LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified in clause 5.31 .2 .
\( 1> \) if the BWP is deactivated:
\( 2> \) not transmit SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) not transmit S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) not transmit PSCCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit SL-PRS on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not transmit SL-SCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not receive PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) not receive SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) not receive S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;
\( 2> \) not receive PSCCH on the BWP;
\( 2> \) not receive SL-PRS on the BWP;
