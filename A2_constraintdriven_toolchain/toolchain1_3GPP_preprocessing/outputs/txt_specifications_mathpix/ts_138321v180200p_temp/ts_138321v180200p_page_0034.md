1> among the available sets of Random Access resources for this Random Access procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1c), identify those configured with a feature which has the highest priority assigned in featurePriorities among all the features applicable to this Random Access procedure as specified in TS 38.331 [5].
\( 1> \) if a single set of Random Access resources is identified:
\( 2> \) select this set of Random Access resources.
\( 1> \) else if more than one set of Random Access resources is identified:
\( 2> \) if all the identified sets of Random Access resources are configured with Msgl repetition indication and the same feature Combination:
\( 3> \) select the set of Random Access resources that associated with highest Msgl repetition number among the identified sets of Random Access resources.
\( 2> \) else:
3> repeat the procedure taking as an input the identified sets of Random Access resources and the feature applicable to the current Random Access procedure with the highest priority assigned in featurePriorities among all the features applicable to this Random Access procedure, except the features considered already.
\( 1> \) else (i.e no set of Random Access resources is identified):
\( 2> \) repeat the procedure taking as an input the previous identified available sets of Random Access resources and the feature applicable to the current Random Access procedure with the highest priority assigned in featurePriorities among all the features applicable to this Random Access procedure, except the features considered already.
5.1.1e Selection of Msg1 repetition for SI request

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum 8 is configured and the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than rsrp-ThresholdMsgl-RepetitionNum8:
\( 2> \) criteria to apply Msgl repetition for SI request is considered met and Msgl repetition number applicable is 8 .
\( 1> \) else if si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum 4 is configured and the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNum4:
\( 2> \) criteria to apply Msgl repetition for SI request is considered met and Msgl repetition number applicable is 4 .
\( 1> \) else si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum 2 is configured and the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNum2:
\( 2> \) criteria to apply Msgl repetition for SI request is considered met and Msgl repetition number applicable is 2.
5.1.2 Random Access Resource selection

If the selected \( R A \_ \)TYPE is set to 4 -stepRA, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery (as specified in clause 5.17 ); and
\( 1> \) if the beamFailureRecoveryTimer (in clause 5.17) is either running or not configured; and
\( 1> \) if the contention-free Random Access Resources for beam failure recovery request associated with any of the SSBs and/or CSI-RSs have been explicitly provided by RRC; and
\( 1> \) if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB amongst the SSBs in candidateBeamRSList or the CSI-RSs with CSI-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS amongst the CSI-RSs in candidateBeamRSList is available:
