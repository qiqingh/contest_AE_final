\( 1> \) if sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig, sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, sl-BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWPPoolConfigCommonA2X is configured according to TS 38.331 [5]; and
\( 1> \) if COT sharing information has not been received from lower layers as specified in TS 37.213[18]; and
\( 1> \) if the new transmission is not associated to a sidelink grant on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 2> \) if the new transmission is associated to a sidelink grant in sl-DiscTxPoolSelected or sl-DiscTxPoolScheduling configured in sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon:

3> select a Destination associated with NR sidelink discovery as specified in TS 23.304 [26], that is in the SL Active time for the SL transmission occasion if SL DRX is applied for the destination, and among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions for the SL grant associated to the SCI:

4> SL data for NR sidelink discovery is available for transmission; and
\( 4>S B j>0 \), in case there is any logical channel having \( S B j>0 \); and
4> sl-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

4> sl-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant.
\( 2> \) else if the new transmission is associated to a sidelink grant in \( s l \)-TxPoolSelectedNormal configured in \( s l \) -BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWP-PoolConfigCommonA2X:

3> select a Destination associated with BRID if sl-A2X-Service in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal indicates brid or bridAndDAA or select a Destination associated with DAA if sl-A2X-Service in sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal indicates daa or bridAndDAA as specified in TS 23.256 [31], and the logical channel with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
\( 4> \) SL data for A2X communication is available for transmission; and
4> \( S B j>0 \), in case there is any logical channel having \( S B j>0 \).
\( 2> \) else:
3> select a Destination associated to one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast (excluding the Destination(s) associated with NR sidelink discovery as specified in TS 23.304 [26] or A2X communication), that is in the SL Active time for the SL transmission occasion if SL DRX is applied for the destination, and having at least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel and pending SL-PRS transmission(s) with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions and MAC CE(s), if any, and SL-PRS(s), if any for the SL grant associated to the SCI:

4> SL data for NR sidelink communication is available for transmission; and
\( 4>S B j>0 \), in case there is any logical channel having \( S B j>0 \); and
4> sl-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

4> sl-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and
4> sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled, if PSFCH is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI.

NOTE 0: A LCH is allowed in a carrier based on whether this selected carrier is within a subset of frequencies associated with all the PC5 QoS flows allowed to be mapped to this LCH based on RRC configuration.

1> else:
\( 2> \) if COT sharing information has been received from lower layers as specified in TS 37.213[18]:
3> if resources used for initial transmission for the SL grant associated to the SCI are within the COT duration and MAC entity decides to use shared COT with type-2 LBT:
