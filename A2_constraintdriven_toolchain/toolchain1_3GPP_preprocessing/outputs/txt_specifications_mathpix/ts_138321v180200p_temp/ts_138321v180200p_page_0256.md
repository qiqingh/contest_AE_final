6.1.3.46 PUCCH Power Control Set Update for multiple TRP PUCCH repetition MAC CE

The PUCCH Power Control Set Update for multiple TRP PUCCH repetition MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a variable size with following fields:
- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;
- C: This field indicates whether single or two power control set(s) is activated for the indicated PUCCH Resource ID. If this field is set to 1 , the second power control set index (i.e. Power Control Set ID1) for the indicated PUCCH Resource is present. If this field is set to 0 , the second power control set index (i.e. Power Control Set ID1) for the indicated PUCCH Resource is not present;
- PUCCH Resource ID: This field contains an identifier of the PUCCH resource ID identified by PUCCHResourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5], which is to be activated with a power control set(s) indicated by Power Control Set IDi fields in the subsequent octet. The length of the field is 7 bits. If the indicated PUCCH Resource ID is included in a PUCCH Resource Group (configured via resourceGroupToAddModList as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) of the indicated UL BWP, no other PUCCH Resources within the same PUCCH Resource group are indicated in the MAC CE, and this MAC CE applies to all the PUCCH Resources in the PUCCH Resource group;
- Power Control Set [D1: This field contains PUCCH-PowerControlSetInfold where PUCCHPowerControlSetInfold is the identifier of the PUCCH Power Control Set in PUCCH-Config in which the PUCCH Resource ID is configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5], where \( i \) is the index of the power control set ID. The length of the field is 3 bits;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
