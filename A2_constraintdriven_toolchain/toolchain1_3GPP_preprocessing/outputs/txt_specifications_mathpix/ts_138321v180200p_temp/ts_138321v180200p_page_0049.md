\( 5> \) perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure for 2-step RA type Random Access (see clause 5.1.2a) after the backoff time.

Upon receiving a fallbackRAR, the MAC entity may stop msgB-ResponseWindow once the Random Access Response reception is considered as successful.
5.1.5 Contention Resolution

Once Msg3 is transmitted the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the Msg3 transmission (i.e initial transmission or HARQ retransmission) is scheduled with PUSCH repetition Type A:
\( 2> \) if Msg 3 is transmitted on a non-terrestrial network:
3> start or restart the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer in the first symbol after the end of all repetitions of the Msg3 transmission plus the UE-gNB RTT.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) start or restart the \( r a \)-ContentionResolutionTimer in the first symbol after the end of all repetitions of the Msg3 transmission.

1> else if Msg3 transmission (i.e initial transmission or HARQ retransmission) is transmitted on a non-terrestrial network:
\( 2> \) start or restart the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer in the first symbol after the end of the Msg3 transmission plus the UE-gNB RTT.

1> else:
\( 2> \) start or restart the ra -ContentionResolutionTimer in the first symbol after the end of the Msg3 transmission.
1> monitor the PDCCH while the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer is running regardless of the possible occurrence of a measurement gap;
\( 1> \) if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell is received from lower layers:
\( 2> \) if the C-RNTI MAC CE was included in Msg3:
3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery or for beam failure recovery of both BFD-RS sets of SpCell (as specified in clause 5-17) and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; or

3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated by a PDCCH order and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; or

3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SDT beam failure recovery (as specified in clause 5.27.1) and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; or

3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated by the MAC sublayer itself or by the RRC sublayer and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI and contains a UL grant for a new transmission:

4> consider this Contention Resolution successful;
4> stop ra-ContentionResolutionTimer;
\( 4> \) discard the TEMPORARY_C-RNTT;
4> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.
\( 2> \) else if the CCCH SDU was included in Msg3 and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to its TEMPORARY_C-RNTI:

3> if the MAC PDU is successfully decoded:
