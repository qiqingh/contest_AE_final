4> select a Destination associated to one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast that satisfy the following destination condition and CAPC condition, and having at least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions and the MAC CE(s) that satisfies CAPC and destination requirement, if any, for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
\( 5> \) if a Source Layer-1 [D and a Destination Layer-1 [D contained in the COT initiator's SCI or COT sharing information match to the 8 LSB of the corresponding Destination Layer-2 ID and the 16 LSB of a Source Layer-2 [Ds relating to the transmission from the responding UE and the cast type indicator in the SCI is set to unicast; or if a Destination Layer-1 ID contained in the COT initiator's SCI or COT sharing information matches to the 16 LSB of a Destination Layer-2 ID relating to the transmission from the responding UE and the cast type indicator in the SCI is set to groupcast or broadcast; and
\( 5> \) if a CAPC value of the SL data has an equal or smaller CAPC value than a CAPC value indicated in the COT sharing information; and

5> SL data is available for transmission; and
\( 5>S B j>0 \), in case there is any logical channel having \( S B j>0 \); and
\( 5>s \)-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

5> sl-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and
\( 5> \) sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled, if PSFCH is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI.

2 else if sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon is not configured according to TS 38.331 [5]; and
\( 2> \) if the new transmission is not associated to a sidelink grant on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
3> select a Destination associated to one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast, that is in the SL Active time for the SL transmission occasion if SL DRX is applied for the destination, and having at least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel and pending SL-PRS transmission(s) with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions and MAC CE(s), if any, and SL-PRS(s), if any, for the SL grant associated to the SCI:

4> SL data is available for transmission; and
\( 4>S B j>0 \), in case there is any logical channel having \( S B j>0 \); and
4> sl-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

4> sl-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and
4> sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled, if PSFCH is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI; and

4> allowed on the carrier where the SCI is transmitted, if the carrier is configured by upper layers according to TS 38.331 [5] and TS 23.287 [19], if multiple carrier frequencies are configured and if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2; and
\( 4> \) having a priority whose associated \( s \)-threshCBR-FreqReselection is no lower than the CBR of the carrier when the carrier is (re-)selected in accordance with clause 5.22.1.11, if multiple carrier frequencies are configured and if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.

NOTE 1: If multiple Destinations have the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same highest priority or if multiple Destinations have either the MAC CE and/or the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same priority as the MAC CE, which Destination is selected among them is up to UE implementation.
