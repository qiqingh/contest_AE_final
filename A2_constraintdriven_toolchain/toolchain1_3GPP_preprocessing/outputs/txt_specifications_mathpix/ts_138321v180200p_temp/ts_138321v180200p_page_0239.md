- Resource ID: This field contains an identifier of the resource used for spatial relationship derivation for SRS resource i. Resource [D0 refers to the first SRS resource within the resource set, Resource [D1 to the second one and so on. If \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , the first bit of this field is always set to 0 . If \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , and the second bit of this field is set to 1 , the remainder of this field contains SSB-Index as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. If \( F_{1} \) is set to 0 , and the second bit of this field is set to 0 , the remainder of this field contains SRS-Resourceld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 8 bits. This field is only present if MAC CE is used for activation of SP SRS resource set, i.e. the A/D field is set to 1 , or for AP SRS resource set;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

6.1.3.27 SRS Pathloss Reference RS Update MAC CE

The SRS Pathloss Reference RS Update MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a fixed size of 24 bits:
- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell, which contains activated SRS Resource Set. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9], which contains activated SRS Resource Set. The length of the field is 2 bits;
- SRS Resource Set ID: This field indicates the SRS Resource Set ID identified by SRS-ResourceSetld as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 4 bits;
- Pathloss Reference RS ID: This field indicates the Pathloss Reference RS ID identified by srs-PathlossReferenceRS-Id as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. It updates the pathloss reference RS for an SRS-resource set indicated by SRS Resource Set ID field. The length of the field is 6 bits;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
