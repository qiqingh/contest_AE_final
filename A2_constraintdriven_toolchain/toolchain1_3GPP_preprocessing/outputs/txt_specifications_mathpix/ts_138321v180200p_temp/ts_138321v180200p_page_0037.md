occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the consecutive PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 [6] corresponding to the selected SSB).
\( 1> \) else if an SSB is selected above:
\( 2> \) if the set of Random Access resources associated with Msgl repetition is selected for this Random Access procedure:
\( 3> \) determine the next available set of PRACH occasions (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) for the Msg1 repetition number applicable for this Random Access procedure corresponding to the selected SSB (the MAC entity shall select a set of PRACH occasions randomly with equal probability amongst sets of PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 [6] regardless the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected SSB and selected Msgl repetition number for this Random Access procedure; the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps when determining the next available set of PRACH occasions corresponding to the selected SSB).
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by the ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex if configured, or ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex if configured, or indicated by PDCCH, or indicated by the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the consecutive PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 [6] regardless the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the selected SSB).

1> else if a CSI-RS is selected above:
\( 2> \) if there is no contention-free Random Access Resource associated with the selected CSI-RS:
\( 3> \) determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions, permitted by the restrictions given by the ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex if configured, corresponding to the SSB in candidateBeamRSList which is quasi-colocated with the selected CSI-RS as specified in TS 38.214 [7] (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the consecutive PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 [6] regardless the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the SSB which is quasi-colocated with the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the SSB which is quasi-colocated with the selected CSI-RS).
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions in ra-OccasionList corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different subcarriers regardless the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the selected CSI-RS).
\( 1> \) perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3).
NOTE 1: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB or a CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS, the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP measurement.

NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: If an (e)RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE mode is configured with a BWP indicated by initial DownlinkB WP-RedCap which is not associated with any SSB, SS-RSRP measurement is performed based on the SSB associated with the BWP indicated by initia/DownlinkBWP. If an (e)RedCap UE in RRC_INACTIVE mode is configured with SDT and with a BWP indicated by initialDownlinkBWPRedCap which is associated with NCD-SSB, SS-RSRP measurement can also be performed based on this NCD-SSB during SDT.
