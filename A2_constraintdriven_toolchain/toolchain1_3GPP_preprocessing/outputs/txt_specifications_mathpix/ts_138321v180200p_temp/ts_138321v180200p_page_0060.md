5.3.2.2 HARQ process

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process shall:
\( 1> \) if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is the first received transmission for the TB according to the system information schedule indicated by RRC; or
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a MCCH-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received transmission for the TB according to the broadcast MCCH schedule indicated by RRC; or
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a Multicast MCCH-RNTI for MBS multicast in RRC_INACTIVE, and this is the first received transmission for the TB according to the multicast MCCH schedule indicated by RRC; or
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a G-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received transmission for the TB according to the MTCH schedule indicated by RRC or according to the scheduling indicated by DCI as specified in TS 38.214 [7]; or
\( 1> \) if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e there is no previous NDI for this TB):
\( 2> \) consider this transmission to be a new transmission.
1> else:
\( 2> \) consider this transmission to be a retransmission.
The MAC entity then shall:
\( 1> \) if this is a new transmission:
\( 2> \) attempt to decode the received data.
\( 1> \) else if this is a retransmission:
\( 2> \) if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
\( 3> \) instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined data.
\( 1> \) if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully decoded for this TB; or
\( 1> \) if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
\( 2> \) if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:
\( 3> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
\( 2> \) else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
\( 3> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
1> else:
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.
\( 1> \) if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful (see clause 5.1.5); or
