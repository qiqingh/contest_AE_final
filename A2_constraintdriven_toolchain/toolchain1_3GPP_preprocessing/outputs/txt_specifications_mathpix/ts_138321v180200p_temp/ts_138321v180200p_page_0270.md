Figure 6.1.3.53-2: Enhanced Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE
6.1.3.54 Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE

The Inter-UE Coordination request MAC CE or Enhanced Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with corresponding LCID as specified in Table 6.2.4-1. The priority of the Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE or Enhanced Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE is fixed to ' 1 ' for Logical Channel Prioritization (LCP) procedure. The Inter-UE Coordination MAC CE has a fixed size of 48 bits (as shown in Figure 6.1.3.54-1), and the Enhanced Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE has a fixed size of 56 bits (as shown in Figure 6.1.3.54-2). The fields are defined as follows:
- RT: If the value of sl-DetermineResourceType (as specified in TS 38.331 [5] clause 6.3.5) is set to ueb, this field indicates the resource set type, i.e., preferred resource set or non-preferred resource set, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Resource set type field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. This field is ignored if the value of slDetermineResourceType is set to uea;
- RP: This field indicates the resource reservation period, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Resource reservation period field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the field is 4 bits. If the length of Resource reservation period field in SCI format 2-C as specified in TS 38.212 [9] is shorter than 4 bit, this field contains Resource reservation period field using the LSB bits;
- Priority: This field indicates the priority, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Priority field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the field is 3 bits;
