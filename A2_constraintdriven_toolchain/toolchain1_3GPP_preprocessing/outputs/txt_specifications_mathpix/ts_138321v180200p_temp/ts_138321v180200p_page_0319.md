Figure 6.2.3a-1: fallbackRAR

The successRAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3a-2, and consists of the following fields:
- UE Contention Resolution Identity: This field contains the UL CCCH SDU. If the UL CCCH SDU is longer than 48 bits, this field contains the first 48 bits of the UL CCCH SDU.
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 ;
- ChannelAccess-CPext: The channel access type and CP extension for the PUCCH resource containing the HARQ feedback for MSGB in shared spectrum channel access as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The field is only present when the MSGB HARQ feedback is to be transmitted with shared spectrum channel access as specified in TS 37.213 [18]. Otherwise, the field is not present and R bits are present instead. The size of the ChannelAccess-CPext field is 2 bits;
- TPC: The TPC command for the PUCCH resource containing HARQ feedback for MSGB, as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the TPC field is 2 bits;
- HARQ Feedback Timing Indicator: The PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field for MSGB HARQ feedback as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the HARQ Feedback Timing Indicator field is 3 bits;
- PUCCH Resource Indicator: The PUCCH resource indicator for HARQ feedback for MSGB, as specified in TS 38.213[6]. The size of the PUCCH resource Indicator field is 4 bits;
- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates the index value \( T_{A} \) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 [6]. The size of the Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;
- C-RNTI: The C-RNTI field indicates the identity that is used by the MAC entity upon completion of Random Access. The size of the C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The successRAR is octet aligned.
