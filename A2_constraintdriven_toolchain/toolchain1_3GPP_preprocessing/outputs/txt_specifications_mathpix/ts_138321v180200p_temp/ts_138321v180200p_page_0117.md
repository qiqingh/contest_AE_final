\( 1> \) for each DL HARQ process used for MBS multicast, consider the next received transmission for a TB as the very first transmission.

Otherwise, if a reset of the MAC entity is requested by upper layers or the reset of the MAC entity is triggered due to SCG deactivation as defined in clause 5.29 , the MAC entity shall:

1> if the MAC reset is not due to SCG deactivation:
\( 2> \) initialize \( B j \) for each logical channel to zero;
\( 1> \) initialize \( S B j \) for each logical channel to zero if Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC;
\( 1> \) if upper layers indicate SCG deactivation and \( b f d \)-and-RLM with value true is configured for the deactivated SCG:
\( 2> \) stop (if running) all timers except beamFailureDetectionTimer associated with PSCell and timeAlignmentTimers.

1> else:
\( 2> \) stop (if running) all timers, except MBS broadcast DRX timers;
\( 2> \) consider all timeAlignmentTimers, inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer, and cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer, if configured, as expired and perform the corresponding actions in clause 5.2;
\( 1> \) set the NDIs for all uplink HARQ processes to the value 0 ;
\( 1> \) sets the NDIs for all HARQ process [Ds to the value 0 for monitoring PDCCH in Sidelink resource allocation mode 1;
\( 1> \) stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure;
\( 1> \) discard explicitly signalled contention-free Random Access Resources for 4 -step RA type and 2 -step RA type, if any;
\( 1> \) flush Msg3 buffer;
\( 1> \) flush MSGA buffer;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Scheduling Request procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Buffer Status Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Delay Status Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Power Headroom Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered BFR ;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink Buffer Status Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Pre-emptive Buffer Status Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Timing Advance Reporting procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Recommended bit rate query procedure;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Configured uplink grant confirmation;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered configured sidelink grant confirmation;
\( 1> \) clear, if any, configured sidelink grants;
\( 1> \) cancel, if any, triggered Desired Guard Symbol query;
