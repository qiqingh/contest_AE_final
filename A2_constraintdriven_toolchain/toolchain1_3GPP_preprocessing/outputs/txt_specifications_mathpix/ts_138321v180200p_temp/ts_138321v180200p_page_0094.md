- drx-LongCycleStartOffset: the Long DRX cycle and drx-StartOffset which defines the subframe where the Long and Short DRX cycle starts;
- drx-NonIntegerLongCycleStartOffset (optional): the Long DRX cycle and drx-StartOffset which defines the subframe where the Long and Short DRX cycle start, when the length of the Long DRX cycle and/or the short DRX cycle is not an integer;
- drx-ShortCycle (optional): the Short DRX cycle;
- \( d r x \)-NonIntegerShortCycle (optional): the Short DRX cycle whose length is not an integer;
- drx-ShortCycleTimer (optional): the duration the UE shall follow the Short DRX cycle;
- drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast process): the minimum duration before a DL assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity;
- drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer UL (per UL HARQ process): the minimum duration before a UL HARQ retransmission grant is expected by the MAC entity;
- drx-RetransmissionTimerSL (per sidelink process): the maximum duration until a grant for SL retransmission is received;
- drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerSL (per sidelink process): the minimum duration before an SL retransmission grant is expected by the MAC entity;
- drx-LastTransmissionUL (optional): the configuration to start drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL after the last transmission within a bundle;
- \( p s \)-Wakeup (optional): the configuration to start associated drx-onDurationTimer in case DCP is monitored but not detected;
- ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI (optional): the configuration to report periodic CSI that is not L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in case DCP is configured but associated drx-onDurationTimer is not started;
- ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP (optional): the configuration to transmit periodic CSI that is L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in case DCP is configured but associated drxonDurationTimer is not started;
- downlinkHARQ-FeedbackDisabled (optional): the configuration to disable HARQ feedback per DL HARQ process;
- uplinkHARQ-Mode (optional): the configuration to set HARQmodeA or HARQmodeB per UL HARQ process;
- disableCG-RetransmissionMonitoring (optional): the configuration to disable starting drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer UL for UL transmission over a configured uplink grant;
- drx-TimeReferenceSFN (optional): the configuration to indicate how UE initializes of \( D R X_{-} S F N \_ \)COUNTER

The following UE variable is used for the DRX operation if drx-NonIntegerLongCycleStartOffset is configured:
- DRX_SFN_COUNTER: the counter that increments when SFN changes to 0 . The maximum value of this counter is at least 65535 .

Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX groups with separate DRX parameters. When RRC does not configure a secondary DRX group, there is only one DRX group and all Serving Cells belong to that one DRX group. When two DRX groups are configured, each Serving Cell is uniquely assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX parameters that are separately configured for each DRX group are: drx-onDurationTimer, drxInactivityTimer. The DRX parameters that are common to the DRX groups are: drx-SlotOffset, drxRetransmissionTimerDL, drx-RetransmissionTimerUL, drx-LongCycleStartOffset, drxNonIntegerLongCycleStartOffset, drx-ShortCycle (optional), drx-NonIntegerShortCycle (optional), drxShortCycleTimer (optional), drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL, and drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL.

When DRX is configured, the Active Time for Serving Cells in a DRX group includes the time while:
- drx-onDurationTimer or drx-InactivityTimer configured for the DRX group is running; or
