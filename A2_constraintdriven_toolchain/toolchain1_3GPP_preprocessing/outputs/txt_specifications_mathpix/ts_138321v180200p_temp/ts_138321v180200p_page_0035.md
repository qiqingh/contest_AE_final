\( 2> \) select an SSB with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB amongst the SSBs in candidateBeamRSList or a CSIRS with CSI-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS amongst the CSI-RSs in candidateBeamRSList;
\( 2> \) if CSI-RS is selected, and there is no ra-PreambleIndex associated with the selected CSI-RS:
3> set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to a ra-PreambleIndex corresponding to the SSB in candidateBeamRSList which is quasi-colocated with the selected CSI-RS as specified in TS 38.214 [7].
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to a ra-Preamblelndex corresponding to the selected SSB or CSI-RS from the set of Random Access Preambles for beam failure recovery request.

1> else if the ra-PreambleIndex has been explicitly provided by PDCCH; and
1> if the ra-PreambleIndex is not 0 b 000000 :
\( 2> \) set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to the signalled ra-PreambleIndex;
\( 2> \) select the SSB signalled by PDCCH.
1> else if contention-free Random Access Resources have been explicitly provided by an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE and the SS-RSRP of the SSB signalled by the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE is above rsrp-ThresholdSSB:
\( 2> \) set the PREAMBLE INDEX to the Random Access Preamble index signalled by the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE;
\( 2> \) select the SSB signalled by the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE.
1> else if contention-free Random Access Resources have not been explicitly provided by an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE, the Random Access procedure was not initiated for recovery using an LTM candidate configuration as specified in TS 38.331 [5] clause 5.3.7.3, contention-free Random Access Resources associated with SSBs have been explicitly provided in rach-ConfigDedicated and at least one SSB with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB amongst the associated SSBs is available:
\( 2> \) select an SSB with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB amongst the associated SSBs;
\( 2> \) set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to a ra-Preamblelndex corresponding to the selected SSB.
1> else if contention-free Random Access Resources have not been explicitly provided by an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE, the Random Access procedure was not initiated for recovery using an LTM candidate configuration as specified in TS 38.331 [5] clause 5.3.7.3, contention-free Random Access Resources associated with CSI-RSs have been explicitly provided in rach-ConfigDedicated and at least one CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS amongst the associated CSI-RSs is available:
\( 2> \) select a CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS amongst the associated CSI-RSs;
\( 2> \) set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to a ra-PreambleIndex corresponding to the selected CSI-RS.
1> else if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]); and
\( 1> \) if the Random Access Resources for SI request have been explicitly provided by RRC:
2 if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB is available:
3> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above rsrp-ThresholdSSB.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) select any SSB.
2> select a Random Access Preamble corresponding to the selected SSB, from the Random Access Preamble(s) determined according to ra-PreambleStartIndex as specified in TS 38.331 [5];
\( 2> \) set the PREAMBLE_INDEX to selected Random Access Preamble.
