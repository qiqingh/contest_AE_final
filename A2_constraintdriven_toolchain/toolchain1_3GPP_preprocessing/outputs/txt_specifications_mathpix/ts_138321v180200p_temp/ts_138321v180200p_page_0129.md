3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE. \( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) trigger the SR for beam failure recovery of each BFD-RS set for which BFR has been triggered, not cancelled, and for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed;

3> trigger the SR for SCell beam failure recovery for each SCell for which BFR has been triggered, not cancelled, and for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed.

All BFRs triggered for an SCell shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a MAC CE for BFR which contains beam failure information of that SCell. All BFRs triggered for a BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes an Enhanced BFR MAC CE or Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure recovery information of that BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell.
