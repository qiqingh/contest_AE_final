- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL, drx-RetransmissionTimer UL or drx-RetransmissionTimerSL is running on any Serving Cell in the DRX group; or
- ra-ContentionResolutionTimer (as described in clause 5.1.5) or msgB-ResponseWindow (as described in clause 5.1.4a) is running; or
- a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending (as described in clause 5.4 .4 or 5.22 .1 .5 ). If this Serving Cell is part of a non-terrestrial network, the Active Time is started after the Scheduling Request transmission that is performed when the SR_COUNTER is 0 for all the SR configurations with pending SR(s) plus the UE-gNB RTT; or
- a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among the contention-based Random Access Preamble (as described in clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.4a); or
- there is an ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch; or
- there is an ongoing RACH-less handover in a terrestrial network.

The following MAC timers are used for DRX operation in a non-terrestrial network:
- HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN (per DL HARQ process configured with HARQ feedback enabled): the minimum duration before a DL assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity;
- HARQ-RTT-TimerUL-NTN (per UL HARQ process configured with HARQModeA): the minimum duration before a UL HARQ retransmission grant is expected by the MAC entity.

When DRX is not configured and multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment for unicast; or
1> if the PDCCH indicates a DL unicast transmission:
\( 2> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process.
When DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment for unicast:
\( 2> \) if this Serving Cell is configured with downlinkHARQ-FeedbackDisabled:
\( 3> \) if the corresponding HARQ process is configured with HARQ feedback enabled:
\( 4> \) set \( H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \) Timer \( D L \) plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 4> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) start the \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.

NOTE 1a: Void.
NOTE 1b:Void.
\( 2> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process;
\( 2> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process.
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
