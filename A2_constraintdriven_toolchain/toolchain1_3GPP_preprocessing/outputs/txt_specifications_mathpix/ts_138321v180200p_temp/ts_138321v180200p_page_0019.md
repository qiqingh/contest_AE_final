- signalling of HARQ feedback;
- signalling of Scheduling Request;
- measurements (e.g. Channel Quality Indication (CQI)).
4.4 Functions

The MAC sublayer supports the following functions:
- mapping between logical channels and transport channels;
- multiplexing of MAC SDUs from one or different logical channels onto transport blocks (TB) to be delivered to the physical layer on transport channels;
- demultiplexing of MAC SDUs to one or different logical channels from transport blocks (TB) delivered from the physical layer on transport channels;
- scheduling information reporting;
- error correction through HARQ;
- logical channel prioritization;
- priority handling between overlapping resources of one UE;
- radio resource selection.

The relevance of MAC functions for uplink, downlink, and sidelink is indicated in Table 4.4-1.

4.5 Channel structure
4.5.1 General

The MAC sublayer operates on the channels defined below; transport channels are SAPs between MAC and Layer 1, logical channels are SAPs between MAC and RLC.
4.5.2 Transport Channels

The MAC sublayer uses the transport channels listed in Table 4.5.2-1 below.
