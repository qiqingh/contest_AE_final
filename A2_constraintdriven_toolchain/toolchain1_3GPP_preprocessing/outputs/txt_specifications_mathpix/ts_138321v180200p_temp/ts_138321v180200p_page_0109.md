configured uplink grant in a multi-PUSCH configured grant, in the \( \mathrm{N}^{\text {th }}(\mathrm{N} \geq 0) \) periodicity occurs in the symbol for which:
```
            [(SFN × numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot)
\( +( \) slot number in the frame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot \( )+ \) symbol number in the slot \( ]= \)
    (timeReferenceSFN × numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot
        + timeDomainOffset × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot \( +\mathrm{S}+\mathrm{N} \times \) periodicity)
        modulo (1024 × numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot)
```


If cg-SDT-PeriodicityExt (as defined in TS 38.331 [5]) is configured, after an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the configured uplink grant, or the first configured uplink grant in a multi-PUSCH configured grant, in the \( \mathrm{N}^{\text {th }}(\mathrm{N} \geq 0) \) periodicity occurs in the symbol for which:
```
[( H -SFN × numberOfSFNperH-SFN +SFN\( ) \times \) numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot
    + (slot number in the frame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot \( )+ \) symbol number in the slot] \( = \)
            ((timeReferenceH-SFN × numberOfSFNperH-SFN + timeReferenceSFN)
                × numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot
            + timeDomainOffset × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot \( +\mathrm{S}+\mathrm{N} \times \) periodicity)
        modulo ( \( 1024 \times 1024 \times \) numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot)
```


For a multi-PUSCH configured grant Type 1 , the \( \mathrm{M}^{\text {th }}(1<\mathrm{M} \leq \) nrofSlotsInCG-Period) configured uplink grant within a periodicity occurs (M-1) × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot symbols after the symbol in which the first configured uplink grant in that periodicity occurs.

For an uplink grant configured for configured grant Type 1 for CG-SDT on the selected uplink carrier as in clause 5.27, when CG-SDT is triggered and not terminated, for each configured uplink grant valid according to TS 38.214 [7] for which the above formula is satisfied, the MAC entity shall:

1> if, after initial transmission for CG-SDT with CCCH message has been performed according to clause 5.4.1, PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity's C-RNTI has not been received:
\( 2> \) if the SSB corresponding to the configured UL grant has the same SSB index as the SSB selected for initial transmission for CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., retransmission of initial transmission of CG-SDT):

3> select this SSB;
3> indicate the SSB index corresponding to the configured uplink grant to the lower layer;
\( 3> \) consider this configured uplink grant as valid.
1> else if at least one SSB configured for CG-SDT with SS-RSRP above cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB is available:
\( 2> \) if at least one SSB corresponding to the configured uplink grant with SS-RSRP above the cg-SDT-RSRPThresholdSSB is available:

3> if this is the initial transmission of CG-SDT with CCCH message after the CG-SDT procedure is initiated as in clause 5.27 (i.e., initial transmission for CG-SDT):

4> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB amongst the SSB(s) associated with the configured uplink grant.

3> else if PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI has been received after the initial transmission of CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., subsequent new transmission for CG-SDT):
\( 4> \) if SS-RSRP of the SSB selected for the previous transmission for CG-SDT is above cg-SDT-RSRPThresholdSSB and this SSB is associated with this configured uplink grant:
\( 5> \) select this SSB.
4> else if SS-RSRP of the SSB selected for the previous transmission for CG-SDT is not above cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB:
\( 5> \) select an SSB with SS-RSRP above cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB amongst the SSB(s) associated with the configured uplink grant.
