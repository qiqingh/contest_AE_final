Figure 6.1.3.64-1: Desired IAB-MT PSD range MAC CE
6.1.3.65 Timing Case Indication MAC CE

The Timing Case Indication MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a variable size with following fields (Figure 6.1.3.65-1):
- Resource Configuration ID: This field indicates the RRC configuration which applies to this MAC CE and corresponds to iab-ResourceConfigID parameter in IAB-ResourceConfig as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The length of the field is 16 bits;
- Timing mode \( \mathrm{ID}_{1} \) : when this field is set to 00 , the timing mode applied to the \( \mathrm{i}^{\text {th }} \) slot in the list of slots slotList provided via RRC in IAB-ResourceConfig is Case-1; when this field is set to 01, the timing mode applied to the \( i^{\text {th }} \) slot in the list of slots slotList provided via RRC in IAB-ResourceConfig is Case-6; when this field is set to 10, the timing mode applied to the \( 1^{\text {th }} \) slot in the list of slots slotList provided via RRC in IAB-ResourceConfig is Case-7. The total number N of Timing mode \( \mathrm{ID}_{1} \) fields corresponds to the size of slotList provided via RRC in IAB-ResourceConfig. If number N is not divisible by \( 4,(4-\mathrm{N} \bmod 4) \) of the final Timing mode \( \mathrm{ID}_{1} \) fields are disregarded by the receiving \( [\mathrm{AB} \) node. The length of the field is 2 bits.
