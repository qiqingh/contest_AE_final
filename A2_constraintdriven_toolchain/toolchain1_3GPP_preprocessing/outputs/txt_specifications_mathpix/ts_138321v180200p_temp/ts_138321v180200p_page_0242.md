6.1.3.30 LBT failure MAC CEs

The LBT failure MAC CE of one octet is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2. It has a fixed size and consists of a single octet containing 8 C -fields as follows (Figure 6.1.3.30-1).

The LBT failure MAC CE of four octets is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2. It has a fixed size and consists of four octets containing 32 C -fields as follows (Figure 6.1.3.30-2).

A single octet format is used when the highest ServCellIndex of this MAC entity's Serving Cell for which consistent LBT failure is detected is less than 8 , otherwise four octets format is used.
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) : If there is a Serving Cell configured for the MAC entity with ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and if consistent LBT failure have been triggered and not cancelled in this Serving Cell, the field is set to 1 , otherwise the field is set to 0 .
