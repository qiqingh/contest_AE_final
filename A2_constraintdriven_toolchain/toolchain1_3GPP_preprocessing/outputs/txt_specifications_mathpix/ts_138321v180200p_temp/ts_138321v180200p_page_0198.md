\( 1> \) else if multiple s/-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle that include one or multiple sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle that are mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List and, if applicable, one sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle that is configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC and cannot be mapped with any SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List are associated to a Destination Layer-2 ID and the associated cast type groupcast or broadcast:

\( 1> \) if a single \( s \)-DRX-GC-BC-OnDuration Timer that is mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List or a single sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer that is configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC and cannot be mapped with any SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List is associated to a Destination and the associated cast type is groupcast or broadcast:
\( 2> \) select the sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer that is mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List or the sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC associated with the Destination.

\( 2> \) select the sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer whose length is the longest one among multiple sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer that are mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List and sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC associated with the Destination Layer-2 ID.
\( 1> \) if a single sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer that is mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List or a single sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer that is configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC and cannot be mapped with any SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List is associated to a Destination and the associated cast type is groupcast:

\( 1> \) else if multiple \( s / \)-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer that include one or multiple \( s / \)-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer that are mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List and, if applicable, one sl-DRX-GCInactivityTimer that is configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC and cannot be mapped with any SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List of a Destination Layer-2 [D and the associated cast type is groupcast:
\( 2> \) select s/-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer whose length is the longest one among multiple sl-DRX-GCInactivityTimer that are mapped with one or multiple SL-QoS-Profile in sl-DRX-GC-BC-PerQoS-List and sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer configured in sl-DefaultDRX-GC-BC associated with the Destination Layer-2 ID.
\( 1> \) if an \( s l \)-dr \( x \)-HARQ-RTT-Timer expires:
\( 2> \) if the data of the corresponding Sidelink process was not successfully decoded or if the HARQ feedback (i.e., negative acknowledgement) is not transmitted for unicast due to UL/SL prioritization:
\( 3> \) start the sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding Sidelink process in the first slot after the expiry of \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer.

When the cast type is groupcast or broadcast as indicated by upper layer, or the cast type is unicast for the reception of Direct Link Establishment Request message [28] or ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request message [29] as indicated by upper layer, or for the reception of discovery message [26], the \( s l \)-drx-StartOffset and \( s l \)-drx-SlotOffset are derived from the following equations:
sl-drx-StartOffset (ms) = Destination Layer-2 [D modulo sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle (ms).
