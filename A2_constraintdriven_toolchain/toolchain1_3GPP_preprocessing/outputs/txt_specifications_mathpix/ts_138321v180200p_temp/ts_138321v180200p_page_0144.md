ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] or if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation scheme 1 as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] and PDCCH is received for resource allocation on Shared SL-PRS resource pool, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each grant received for this PDCCH occasion:

1> if a sidelink grant has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's SL-RNTI:
\( 2> \) if the NDI received on the PDCCH has not been toggled compared to the value in the previously received HARQ information for the HARQ Process ID:

3> use the received sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s), if available, for one or more retransmissions of a single MAC PDU for the corresponding Sidelink process according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7] and SL-PRS according to clause 8.1 . 4 of TS 38.214 [7].
\( 2> \) else:
3> use the received sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s), if available, for initial transmission and, if available, retransmission(s) of a single MAC PDU and SL-PRS according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7].

NOTE 0: When SL-PRS is transmitted on Shared SL-PRS resource pool, the PSSCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s) are determined only after the LCP procedure in clause 5.22.1.4.1.
\( 1> \) else if a sidelink grant has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's SL-CS-RNTI:
\( 2> \) if PDCCH contents indicate retransmission(s) for the identified HARQ process ID that has been set for an activated configured sidelink grant identified by sl-ConfigIndexCG:
\( 3> \) use the received sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s), if available, for one or more retransmissions of a single MAC PDU and SL-PRS according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7].
\( 2> \) else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 deactivation for a configured sidelink grant:
3> trigger configured sidelink grant confirmation for the configured sidelink grant.
\( 2> \) else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 activation for a configured sidelink grant:
3> trigger configured sidelink grant confirmation for the configured sidelink grant;
3> store the configured sidelink grant;
3> initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine the set of PSCCH durations and the set of PSSCH durations for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7] and the set of SL-PRS transmission occasions for transmission of multiple SL-PRS according to clause of 8.2 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], if available.
\( 1> \) if a dynamic sidelink grant is available for retransmission(s) of a MAC PDU which has been positively acknowledged as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a:
\( 2> \) clear the PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) corresponding to retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU from the sidelink grant.

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation scheme 1 as in TS 38.331 [5] and PDCCH is received for resource allocation on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion:
\( 1> \) if a sidelink grant has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's SL-PRS-RNTI: (i.e., dynamic grant)
\( 2> \) use the received sidelink grant to determine the PSCCH duration(s) and the corresponding SL-PRS occasion(s) for the transmission of SL-PRS.

1> else if a sidelink grant has been received on the PDCCH for MAC entity's SL-PRS-CS-RNTI: (i.e., configured sidelink grant type 2)
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH content indicates the configured grant Type 2 activation for a configured sidelink grant:
