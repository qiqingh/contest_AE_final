\( 5> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.
\( 5> \) else if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by physical layer as clause 8.2 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission.

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE does not have its own sensing result as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE and if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources belonging to the received preferred resource set for SL-SCH data to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.

3> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and nonpreferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE has its own sensing result as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE and if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity within the intersection of the received preferred resource set and the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for an SL-SCH data to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SLPRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.

4> if there are no resources within the intersection that can be selected as the time and frequency resources for the one transmission opportunity according to the amount of selected frequency resources and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier.
\( 5> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier.

3> use the randomly selected resource to select a set of periodic resources spaced by the resource reservation interval for transmissions of PSCCH, PSSCH and SL-PRS corresponding to the number of transmission opportunities of MAC PDUs or SL-PRSs determined in TS 38.214 [7].

3> if one or more SL-PRS retransmissions are selected and the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources, according to the selected number of retransmissions and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9];

4> use the randomly selected resource to select a set of periodic resources spaced by the resource reservation interval for transmissions of PSCCH and SL-PRS corresponding to the number of retransmission opportunities of SL-PRS;
