NOTE 4a: MCS table selection is up to UE implementation if more than one MCS table is configured.
2 if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 or Sidelink resource allocation Scheme 1 for SL-PRS transmission on Shared SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 3> \) select a MCS which is, if configured, within the range that is configured by RRC between sl-MinMCSPSSCH and \( s l \)-MaxMCS-PSSCH associated with the selected MCS table included in \( s l \) ConfigDedicatedNR;

3> set the resource reservation interval to 0 ms .
\( 2> \) else if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 or Sidelink resource allocation Scheme 2 for SL-PRS transmission on Shared SL-PRS resource pool:

3> select a MCS which is, if configured, within the range, if configured by RRC, between s/-MinMCSPSSCH and \( s l \)-MaxMCS-PSSCH associated with the selected MCS table included in \( s l \)-PSSCHTxConfigList and, if configured by RRC, overlapped between sl-MinMCS-PSSCH and sl-MaxMCSPSSCH associated with the selected MCS table indicated in sl-CBR-PriorityTx ConfigList for the highest priority of the sidelink logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU or pending SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, and the CBR measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [24] if CBR measurement results are available or the corresponding sl-DefaultTxConfigIndex configured by RRC if CBR measurement results are not available or the corresponding \( s \)-DefaultCBR-PartialSensing configured by RRC if partial sensing is selected and CBR measurement results are not available, or the corresponding sl-DefaultCBR-RandomSelection configured by RRC if random selection is selected and CBR measurement results are not available in case the \( s l \)-TxPoolExceptional is not used;

3> if the MAC entity decides not to use the selected sidelink grant for the next PSSCH duration corresponding to an initial transmission opportunity:

4> set the resource reservation interval to 0 ms .
\( 3> \) else:
4> set the resource reservation interval to the selected value.
NOTE 5: MCS selection is up to UE implementation if the MCS or the corresponding range is not configured by RRC.
\( 2> \) if the configured sidelink grant has been activated and this PSSCH duration corresponds to the first PSSCH transmission opportunity within this sl-PeriodCG of the configured sidelink grant:

3> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PSSCH duration and, if available, all subsequent PSSCH duration(s) occuring in this sl-PeriodCG for the configured sidelink grant;
\( 3> \) determine that this PSSCH duration is used for initial transmission;
3> flush the HARQ buffer of Sidelink process associated with the HARQ Process ID.
\( 2> \) deliver the sidelink grant, the selected MCS, and the associated HARQ information to the Sidelink HARQ Entity for this PSSCH duration.

The MAC entity shall for each PSCCH duration on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
1> if the MAC entity is not configured with multiple SL-PRS transmissions with Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2; or
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is configured with Sidelink resource allocation scheme 1:
\( 2> \) set the resource reservation period to 0 .
\( 1> \) else if the MAC entity is configured with multiple SL-PRS transmission with Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2:
\( 2> \) set the resource reservation period to the selected value.
