NOTE 1: If the MAC entity is configured with multiple configured sidelink grants, collision among the configured sidelink grants may occur. How to handle the collision is left to UE implementation.

After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of the \( S^{\text {th }} \) sidelink grant occurs in the logical slot for which:
\[
\text { CURRENT_slot }=(s l \text {-ReferenceSlotCG-Typel }+s l \text {-TimeOffsetCG-Typel }+\mathrm{S} \times \text { PeriodicitySL }) \text { modulo } \mathrm{T}_{\max }^{\prime}
\]
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource pool, PeriodicitySL = \( \left\lceil\frac{T^{\prime} \max ^{2}}{10240 \mathrm{~ms}} \times s\right. \) l-PeriodCG \( \rceil \) and \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {max }}^{\prime} \) is the number of slots that belongs to the associated resource pool as defined in clause 8 of TS 38.214[7]. sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Typel refers to reference logical slot defined by sl-TimeReferenceSFNTypel.

After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of \( \mathrm{S}^{\text {th }} \) sidelink grant occurs in the logical slot for which:
\[
\text { CURRENT_slot }=(\text { sl-StartSlotCG-Type } 2+\mathrm{S} \times \text { PeriodicitySL }) \text { modulo } \mathrm{T}_{\max }^{\prime}
\]
where sl-StartSlotCG-Type2 refers to the logical slot of the first transmission opportunity of PSSCH or SL-PRS where the configured sidelink grant was (re)initialised.

When a configured sidelink grant is released by RRC, all the corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding sidelink grants shall be cleared.

The MAC entity shall:
1> if the configured sidelink grant confirmation has been triggered and not cancelled; and
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
\( 2> \) instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.34;
\( 2> \) cancel the triggered configured sidelink grant confirmation.
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the corresponding configured sidelink grant immediately after first transmission of Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE triggered by the configured sidelink grant deactivation.
5.9 Activation/Deactivation of SCells

If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, the network may activate and deactivate the configured SCells. Upon configuration of an SCell, the SCell is deactivated unless the parameter sCellState is set to activated for the SCell by upper layers.

The configured SCell(s) is activated and deactivated by:
- receiving the SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.10;
- receiving the Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.55;
- configuring sCellDeactivationTimer timer per configured SCell (except the SCell configured with PUCCH, if any): the associated SCell is deactivated upon its expiry;
- configuring sCellState per configured SCell: if configured, the associated SCell is activated upon SCell configuration;
- receiving scg-State: the SCells of SCG are deactivated.

The MAC entity shall for each configured SCell:
1> if an SCell is configured with sCellState set to activated upon SCell configuration, or an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or an Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the SCell:
