\( 1> \) discard the received subPDU and any remaining subPDUs in the MAC PDU.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or G-RNTI, or by the configured downlink assignment, containing an LCID or eLCID value which is not configured, or an LCID or eLCID value associated with a suspended RB as specified in TS 38.331 [5], the MAC entity shall at least:
\( 1> \) discard the received subPDU.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU on SL-SCH containing a Reserved LCID value for broadcast or groupcast, or an LCID value which is not configured, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) discard the received subPDU.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU on SL-SCH containing a Reserved LCID value for unicast, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) discard the received subPDU and any remaining subPDUs in the MAC PDU.
5.14 Handling of measurement gaps

During an activated measurement gap, the MAC entity shall, on the Serving Cell(s) in the corresponding frequency range of the measurement gap configured by measGapConfig as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
\( 1> \) not perform the transmission of HARQ feedback, SR, and CSI;
\( 1> \) not report SRS;
1> not transmit on UL-SCH except for Msg3 or the MSGA payload as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\( 1> \) if the ra-ResponseWindow or the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer or the msgB-ResponseWindow is running, or if there is an ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch, or if there is an ongoing RACH-less handover:
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.5, and 5.7.
1> else:
\( 2> \) not monitor the PDCCH ;
\( 2> \) not receive on DL-SCH.
5.15 Bandwidth Part (BWP) operation
5.15.1 Downlink and Uplink

In addition to clause 12 of TS 38.213 [6], this clause specifies requirements on BWP operation.
A Serving Cell may be configured with one or multiple BWPs, and the maximum number of BWP per Serving Cell is specified in TS 38.213 [6].

The BWP switching for a Serving Cell is used to activate an inactive BWP and deactivate an active BWP at a time. The BWP switching is controlled by the PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant, by the bwpInactivityTimer, by RRC signalling, or by the MAC entity itself upon initiation of Random Access procedure or upon detection of consistent LBT failure on SpCell. Upon RRC (re-)configuration of firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id and/or firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id for SpCell except for PSCell when SCG is deactivated (see clause 5.29) or activation of an SCell, the DL BWP and/or UL BWP indicated by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id and/or firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id respectively (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) is active without receiving PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant. Upon RRC (re-)configuration of firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id for PSCell when SCG is deactivated, the DL BWP is switched to the firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The active BWP for a Serving Cell is indicated by either RRC or PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). For unpaired spectrum, a DL BWP is paired with a UL BWP, and BWP switching is common for both UL and DL.

For each SCell a dormant BWP may be configured with dormantBWP-Id by RRC signalling as described in TS 38.331 [5]. Entering or leaving dormant BWP for SCells is done by BWP switching per SCell or per dormancy SCell group
