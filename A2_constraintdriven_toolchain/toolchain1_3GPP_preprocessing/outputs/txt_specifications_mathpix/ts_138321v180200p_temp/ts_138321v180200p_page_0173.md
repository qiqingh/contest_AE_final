\( 2> \) deliver the acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for the Sidelink process;
\( 1> \) else:
\( 2> \) deliver a negative acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for the Sidelink process;
1> if the PSSCH transmission occurs for a pair of Source Layer-2 [D and Destination Layer-2 [D corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers:
\( 2> \) perform the HARQ-Based Sidelink RLF Detection procedure as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.3.
If sl-PUCCH-Config is configured by RRC, the MAC entity shall for a PUCCH transmission occasion:
1> if the timeAlignmentTimer, associated with the TAG containing the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or expired, and the Serving Cell is not configured with two TAGs; or

1> if the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted is configured with two TAGs and if the timeAlignmentTimer of the TAG, associated with the TCI state(s) used for transmitting the HARQ feedback, is stopped or expired:
\( 2> \) not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.
\( 1> \) else if all PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for initial transmission of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent and the sidelink grant is ignored according to clause 5.22.1.3.1:
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].

1> else if a MAC PDU has been obtained for a sidelink grant associated to the PUCCH transmission occasion in clause 5.22.1.3.1, the MAC entity shall:
\( 2> \) if the most recent transmission of the MAC PDU was not prioritized as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].

2 else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU and next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU is not required:

3> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
\( 2> \) else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU, and no sidelink grant is available for next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU (including immediately after all PSSCH duration(s) in an sl-PeriodCG for the sidelink grant, the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has not reached \( s \) /-MaxTransNum corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU, if configured in \( s /-C G \) MaxTransNumList for the sidelink grant by RRC), if any; or
\( 2> \) else if PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for one or more retransmissions of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent:

3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
\( 2> \) else:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal an acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6]

1> else:
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
