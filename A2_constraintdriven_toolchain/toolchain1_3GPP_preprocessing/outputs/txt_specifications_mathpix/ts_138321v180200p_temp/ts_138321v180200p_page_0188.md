The MAC entity shall, if Sidelink resource allocation scheme 1 for SL-PRS transmission is configured:
1> if aperiodic SL-PRS is triggered:
\( 2> \) trigger the SL-PRS Resource Request.
\( 1> \) else if periodic SL-PRS is triggered:
\( 2> \) notify RRC to send SL-PRS Resource Request.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if SL-PRS Resource Request is triggered and not cancelled:
2 if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and these UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly entity to generate the SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE.
\( 2> \) else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request for the SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE as specified in clause 5.4.4.
The SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE may be cancelled when SL grant can accommodate all the pending SL-PRS transmissions. The SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a SL-PRS Resource Request MAC CE that indicates request for all the pending SL-PRS transmission(s) since the last event the MAC CE is triggered.
5.22.2 SL-SCH Data and SL-PRS reception
5.22.2.1 SCI reception

SCI indicates if there is a transmission on SL-SCH and provide the relevant HARQ information. SCI can also indicate if there is a SL-PRS transmission. An SCI for SL-SCH transmission with or without corresponding SL-PRS on Shared SL-PRS resource pool consists of two parts: the \( 1^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI on PSCCH and the \( 2{ }^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI on PSSCH as specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. An SCI for SL-PRS transmission on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool consists of a single part on PSCCH as specified in TS 38.212 [9].

The MAC entity shall:
1> for each PSCCH duration during which the MAC entity monitors PSCCH:
2 if a \( 1{ }^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI has been received on the PSCCH:
\( 3> \) determine the set of PSSCH durations in which reception of a \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI and the transport block occur using the received part of the SCI;
\( 3> \) if the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI for this PSSCH duration has been received on the PSSCH:
4> store the SCI as a valid SCI for the PSSCH durations corresponding to transmission(s) of the transport block and SL-PRS, if available and the associated HARQ information and QoS information;
\( 2> \) else if an SCI has been received on the PSCCH reception on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool for SL-PRS transmission:

3> determine the SL-PRS transmission occasion corresponding to the SCI;
3> store the SCI as a valid SCI for the SL-PRS transmission and the corresponding SL-PRS transmission information on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool.

1> for each PSSCH duration for which the MAC entity has a valid SCI:
\( 2> \) deliver the SCI and the associated Sidelink transmission information to the Sidelink HARQ Entity.
\( 1> \) for each SL-PRS transmission occasion for which MAC entity has a valid SCI:
