\( 4> \) stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
\( 1> \) else if this uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
\( 2> \) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of another configured uplink grant which was not already deprioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and
\( 2> \) if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI \( =1 \) or CRNTI which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than or equal to the priority of the uplink grant; and
\( 2> \) if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
\( 3> \) consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
\( 3> \) consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
\( 3> \) if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant configured with autonomous \( T x \) whose PUSCH has already started:

4> stop the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
\( 4> \) stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
\( 3> \) consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-prioritized SR transmission(s), except for the SR transmission(s) whose simultaneous transmission is allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousP UCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority-SecondaryPUCCHgroup-

NOTE 6: If the MAC entity is configured with ch-basedPrioritization and if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants whose priorities are equal, the prioritized uplink grant is determined by UE implementation.

NOTE 7: If the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization and if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants, it is up to UE implementation to choose one of the configured uplink grants.

NOTE 8: If the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, the MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant overlaps with the PUCCH resource for an SR transmission.
5.4.2 HARQ operation
5.4.2.1 HARQ Entity

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell with configured uplink (including the case when it is configured with supplementaryUplink), which maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes.

The number of parallel UL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS 38.214 [7].
Each HARQ process supports one or two TBs.
Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ process identifier. For UL transmission with UL grant in RA Response or for UL transmission for MSGA payload, HARQ process identifier 0 is used.
