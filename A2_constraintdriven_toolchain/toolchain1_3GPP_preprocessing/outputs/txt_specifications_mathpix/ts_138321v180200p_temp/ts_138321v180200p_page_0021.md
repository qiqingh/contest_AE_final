5 MAC procedures
5.1 Random Access procedure
5.1.1 Random Access procedure initialization

The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a PDCCH order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in accordance with TS 38.300 [2]. There is only one Random Access procedure ongoing at any point in time in a MAC entity. The Random Access procedure on an SCell or an LTM candidate cell shall only be initiated by a PDCCH order with ra-PreambleIndex different from 0 b 000000 .

NOTE 1: If a new Random Access procedure is triggered while another is already ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure (e.g. for SI request).

NOTE 2: If there was an ongoing Random Access procedure that is triggered by a PDCCH order while the UE receives another PDCCH order indicating the same Random Access Preamble, PRACH mask index and uplink carrier, the Random Access procedure is considered as the same Random Access procedure as the ongoing one and not initialized again.

When a Random Access procedure is initiated, UE selects a set of Random Access resources as specified in clause 5.1.1b and initialises the following parameters for the Random Access procedure according to the values configured by RRC for the selected set of Random Access resources:
- prach-ConfigurationIndex: the available set of PRACH occasions for the transmission of the Random Access Preamble for Msg1. These are also applicable to the MSGA PRACH if the PRACH occasions are shared between 2 -step and 4 -step RA types;
- prach-ConfigurationPeriodScaling-IAB: the scaling factor defined in TS 38.211 [8] and applicable to [AB-MTs, extending the periodicity of the PRACH occasions baseline configuration indicated by prachConfigurationIndex;
- prach-ConfigurationFrameOffset-IAB: the frame offset defined in TS 38.211 [8] and applicable to IAB-MTs, altering the ROs frame defined in the baseline configuration indicated by prach-ConfigurationIndex;
