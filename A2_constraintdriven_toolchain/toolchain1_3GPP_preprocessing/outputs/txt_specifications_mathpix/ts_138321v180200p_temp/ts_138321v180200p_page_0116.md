ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

The PDCP duplication for all or a subset of associated RLC entities for the configured DRB(s) is activated and deactivated by:
- receiving the Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.32;
- indication by RRC.

The PDCP duplication for all associated RLC entities for the configured DRB(s) is activated by:
- receiving an uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI=1 for a logical channel associated with the DRB configured with survivalTimeStateSupport, described in clause 5.4.1.

The MAC entity shall for each DRB configured with PDCP duplication:
\( 1> \) if a Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the PDCP duplication of the DRB: \( 2> \) indicate the activation of PDCP duplication of the DRB to upper layers.
\( 1> \) if a Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating the PDCP duplication of the DRB: \( 2> \) indicate the deactivation of PDCP duplication of the DRB to upper layers.

1> if a Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating PDCP duplication for associated RLC entities of a DRB configured with PDCP duplication:
\( 2> \) indicate the activation of PDCP duplication for the indicated secondary RLC entity(ies) of the DRB to upper layers.

1> if a Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating PDCP duplication for associated RLC entities of a DRB configured with PDCP duplication:
\( 2> \) indicate the deactivation of PDCP duplication for the indicated secondary RLC entity(ies) of the DRB to upper layers.
\( 1> \) if activation of a PDCP duplication for all configured RLC entities is triggered for the DRB as specified in clause 5.4.1:
\( 2> \) indicate the activation of PDCP duplication for all configured RLC entities of the DRB to upper layers.
NOTE: How to identify "associated RLC entity" or equivalent entity in N3C indirect path for a configured DRB is out of scope of 3GPP.
5.11 MAC reconfiguration

When a reconfiguration of the MAC entity is requested by upper layers, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) initialize the corresponding HARQ entity upon addition of an SCell;
\( 1> \) remove the corresponding HARQ entity upon removal of an SCell;
\( 1> \) apply the new value for timers when the timer is (re)started;
\( 1> \) apply the new maximum parameter value when counters are initialized;
1> apply immediately the configurations received from upper layers for other parameters.
5.12 MAC Reset

If a reset of the MAC entity is requested by upper layers upon receiving RRCResume or RRCSetup, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) stop the MBS multicast DRX timers;
\( 1> \) flush the soft buffers for all DL HARQ processes used for MBS multicast;
