NOTE 3B3: The UE is not required to use any resource from the preferred resource set in its resource (re-)selection if that resource is earlier than ( \( T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L}+T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L}+T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{S L} \) ) after the resource of Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, where \( T_{\text {proc, } 2}^{S L} \) is equal to ( \( T_{\text {proc, } 0}^{S L}+T_{\text {proc, } 1}^{S L} \) ) when only MAC CE is used for inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, or \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{S L} \) is equal to \( T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L} \) when MAC CE and SCI format 2-C are both used for Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission. The case when \( T_{\text {proc }, 2}^{S L} \) is equal to \( T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L} \) is assuming that SCI format 2-C is received. \( T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L} \) and \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \) are specified in clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7].

NOTE 3B4: For Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by an explicit Inter-UE Coordination Request in Scheme 1, whether or not to transmit the Inter-UE Coordination Information upon the Inter-UE Coordination Request reception is determined by UE implementation subject to Release-16 procedure of UL/SL prioritization, LTE SL/NR SL prioritization, and congestion control.

NOTE 3B5: If configured by RRC, si-IUC-Explicit set to enabled and an SL-IUC request is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair of a unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer the resource selection window, resource set type (i.e., preferred resource set), L1 priority, the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH transmission and the resource reservation period for preferred resource set. If configured by RRC, sl-IUC-Explicit set to enabled and an SL-IUC request is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair of a unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer resource set type (i.e., non-preferred resource set) and the resource selection window for non-preferred resource set.

NOTE 3B6: If either sl-IUC-Explicit or sl-IUC-Condition is configured as enabled, UE considers the reception of preferred and non-preferred resource is enabled.

NOTE 3B7: When sl-TriggerConditionCoordInfo is set to value 0 , for groupcast or broadcast of Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by a condition in Scheme 1, which Destination Layer-2 ID (and the corresponding cast-type) a UE selects among Destination Layer-2 IDs that are already used or interested in NR sidelink transmission is up to the UE implementation.

1> if a selected sidelink grant is available for retransmission(s) of a MAC PDU which has been positively acknowledged as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a, except a positive acknowledgement to Multi-consecutive slots transmission (i.e., multiple TBs case) of the MAC PDU and there is remaining slot(s) for this MAC PDU:
\( 2> \) clear the PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) corresponding to retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU from the selected sidelink grant.

NOTE 3C: How the MAC entity determines the remaining PDB of SL data is left to UE implementation.
For a selected sidelink grant, the minimum time gap between any two selected resources comprises:
- For SL operation without shared spectrum channel access, a time gap between the end of the last symbol of a PSSCH transmission of the first resource and the start of the first symbol of the corresponding PSFCH reception determined by sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH and sl-PSFCH-Period for the pool of resources; and
- For SL operation with shared spectrum channel access, the time gap between the end of the last symbol of a PSSCH transmission of the first resource and the start of the first symbol of the last corresponding PSFCH reception occasion determined by sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH, sl-NumPSFCH-Occasions and sl-PSFCH-Period for the pool of resources; and
- a time required for PSFCH reception and processing plus sidelink retransmission preparation including multiplexing of necessary physical channels and any TX-RX/RX-TX switching time.

NOTE 4: How to determine the time required for PSFCH reception and processing plus sidelink retransmission preparation is left to UE implementation.

NOTE 4A: For the minimum time gap requirement on shared SL-PRS resource pool, the last symbol of a PSSCH transmission might be mapped to SL-PRS.

The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH duration not on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 1> \) for each sidelink grant occurring in this PSSCH duration:
\( 2> \) select a MCS table allowed in the pool of resource which is associated with the sidelink grant;
