5.8.3 Sidelink

There are two types of transmission without dynamic sidelink grant:
- configured grant Type 1 where an sidelink grant is provided by RRC, and stored as configured sidelink grant;
- configured grant Type 2 where an sidelink grant is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared as configured sidelink grant based on L1 signalling indicating configured sidelink grant activation or deactivation.

Type 1 and/or Type 2 are configured with a single BWP. Multiple configurations of up to 8 configured grants (including both Type 1 and Type 2, if configured) can be active simultaneously on the BWP.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21]:
- sl-ConfigIndexCG: the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
- sl-CS-RNTI: SL-CS-RNTI for retransmission;
- sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
- sl-Period \( C G \) : periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;
- sl-TimeOffsetCG-Typel: Offset of a resource with respect to reference logical slot defined by sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Typel in time domain, referring to the number of logical slots in a resource pool;
- s/-TimeResourceCG-Typel: time resource location of the configured grant Type 1;
- sl-CG-MaxTransNumList: the maximum number of times that a TB can be transmitted using the configured grant;
- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset: offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type 1;
- sl-PRS-ResourceID: SL-PRS configuration index for configured grant Type 1;
- sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Typel: SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource in time domain. If it is present, the UE uses the first logical slot of associated resource pool after the starting time of the closest SFN with the indicated number preceding the reception of the sidelink configured grant configuration Type 1 as reference logical slot. If it is absent, the indicated reference SFN is zero.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
- sl-ConfigIndexCG: the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
- sl-CS-RNTI: SL-CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
- sl-PRS-CS-RNTI: SL-PRS-CS-RNTI for activation, and deactivation;
- sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
- sl-Period \( C G \) : periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
- sl-CG-MaxTransNumList: the maximum number of times that a TB can be transmitted using the configured grant;
- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset: offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type 2.

Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall for each configured sidelink grant:
\( 1> \) store the sidelink grant provided by RRC as a configured sidelink grant;
\( 1> \) initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s) according to sl-TimeOffsetCG-Typel and sl-TimeResourceCG-Typel, and to reoccur with sl-period \( C G \) for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs and SL-PRS(s) according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7].
