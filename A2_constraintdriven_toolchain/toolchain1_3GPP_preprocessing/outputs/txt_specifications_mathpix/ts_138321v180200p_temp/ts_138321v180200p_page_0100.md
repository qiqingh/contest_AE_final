\( 4> \) start the \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerSL for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding PUCCH resource for the SL HARQ feedback when the PUCCH is not transmitted;
\( 4> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerSL for the corresponding HARQ process.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) start the \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerSL for the corresponding HARQ process at the first symbol after end of PDCCH occasion;
\( 4> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerSL for the corresponding HARQ process.
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH indicates a new transmission (DL, UL or SL) on a Serving Cell in this DRX group:
\( 3> \) start or restart drx-InactivityTimer for this DRX group in the first symbol after the end of the PDCCH reception.

NOTE 3a: A PDCCH indicating activation of SPS, configured grant type 2, or configured sidelink grant of configured grant Type 2 is considered to indicate a new transmission.

NOTE 3b: If the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from corresponding search spaces, as described in clause 10.1 in 38.213, start or restart drx-InactivityTimer for this DRX group in the first symbol after the end of the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time.
\( 2> \) if a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information and acknowledgement is indicated:
\( 3> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimer \( U L \) for the corresponding HARQ process.
\( 1> \) if DCP monitoring is configured for the active DL BWP as specified in TS 38.213 [6], clause 10.3; and
\( 1> \) if the current symbol n occurs within drx-onDurationTimer duration; and
\( 1> \) if drx-onDurationTimer associated with the current DRX cycle is not started as specified in this clause:
\( 2> \) if the MAC entity would not be in Active Time considering grants/assignments/DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and Scheduling Request sent until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in this clause; and
\( 2> \) if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or if all multicast DRXes would not be in Active Time considering multicast assignments/DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol \( n \) when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions are configured with multicast DRX:
\( 3> \) not transmit periodic SRS and semi-persistent SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7];
\( 3> \) not report semi-persistent CSI configured on PUSCH;
\( 3> \) not report semi-persistent CSI on PUCCH;
\( 3> \) if \( p s \)-TransmitPeriodicLl-RSRP is not configured with value true:
4 not report periodic CSI that is L1-RSRP on PUCCH.
\( 3> \) if \( p s \)-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI is not configured with value true:
4 not report periodic CSI that is not L1-RSRP on PUCCH.
1> else:
\( 2> \) in current symbol \( n \), if a DRX group would not be in Active Time considering grants/assignments scheduled on Serving Cell(s) in this DRX group and DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and Scheduling Request sent until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in this clause; and
