- Power Headroom (PH): This field indicates the power headroom level. The length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 below (the corresponding measured values in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- P: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than PMPR_00 as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. [f mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by \( \mathrm{P}^{-} \mathrm{MPR}_{\mathrm{c}} \) as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}} \) field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to power management had been applied;
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{C}} \) : This field indicates the \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, } 5, \mathrm{C}} \) (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) used for calculation of the preceding PH field. The reported \( \mathrm{P}_{\text {CMAX, }, \mathrm{c}} \) and the corresponding nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the corresponding measured values in dBm are specified in TS 38.133 [11]);
- MPE: If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR2, and if the P field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is 2 bits. If mpe-Reporting-FR2 is not configured, or if the Serving Cell operates on FR1, or if the P field is set to 0, R bits or DPC is present instead;
- DPC: [f dpc-Reporting-FR] is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates the \( \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {PowerClass, }} \) as specified in TS 38.101-1[14] and TS 38.101-3 [16]. This field indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.84 and the corresponding measured values of DPC levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11], the DPC field is set to 0 if the criteria to report DPC is not met. The length of the field is 2 bits. If the Serving Cell operates on FR2, R bits or MPE is present instead.
