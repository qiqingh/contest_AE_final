5.18.2 Activation/Deactivation of Semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set

The network may activate and deactivate the configured Semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource sets of a Serving Cell by sending the SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.12. The configured Semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource sets are initially deactivated upon (re-)configuration by upper layers and after reconfiguration with sync.

The MAC entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity receives an SP CSI-RS/CSI-[M Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE on a Serving Cell:
\( 2> \) indicate to lower layers the information regarding the SP CSI-RS/CSI-[M Resource Set Activation/Deactivation MAC CE.
5.18.3 Aperiodic CSI Trigger State Subselection

The network may select among the configured aperiodic CSI trigger states of a Serving Cell by sending the Aperiodic CSI Trigger State Subselection MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.13.

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity receives an Aperiodic CSI trigger State Subselection MAC CE on a Serving Cell:
\( 2> \) indicate to lower layers the information regarding Aperiodic CSI trigger State Subselection MAC CE.
5.18.4 Activation/Deactivation of UE-specific PDSCH TCI state

The network may activate and deactivate the configured TCI states for PDSCH of a Serving Cell or a set of Serving Cells configured in simultaneousTCI-UpdateListl or simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 by sending the TCI States
