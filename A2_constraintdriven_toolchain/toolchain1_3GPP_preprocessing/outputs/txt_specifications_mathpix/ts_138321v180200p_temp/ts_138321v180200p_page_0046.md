3> else:
4> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause 5.1.2) after the backoff time.
The MAC entity may stop ra-ResponseWindow (and hence monitoring for Random Access Response(s)) after successful reception of a Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble identifiers that matches the transmitted PREAMBLE_INDEX.

HARQ operation is not applicable to the Random Access Response reception.
NOTE 2: For the case that RAR PDSCH bandwidth is larger than the band width the eRedCap UE can receive or process per slot, and the UL grant in RAR indicates that the time is not enough for Msg3 transmission, as specified in TS 38.213 [6], it is up to UE implementation, e.g. either to consider the Random Access Response reception not successful, or transmit Msg3.
5.1.4a MSGB reception and contention resolution for 2-step RA type

Once the MSGA preamble is transmitted, regardless of the possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1> start the msgB-ResponseWindow at the PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 [6], clause 8.2A;
\( 1> \) monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for a Random Access Response identified by MSGB-RNTI while the msgBResponseWindow is running;

1> if C-RNTI MAC CE was included in the MSGA:
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response identified by the C-RNTI while the msgBResponseWindow is running.
\( 1> \) if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell is received from lower layers:
\( 2> \) if the C-RNTI MAC CE was included in MSGA:
3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery or for beam failure recovery of both BFD-RS sets of SpCell (as specified in clause 5-17) and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; or

3> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SDT beam failure recovery (as specified in clause 5.27.1) and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI:

4> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;
4> stop the msgB-ResponseWindow;
4> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.
\( 3> \) else if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with at least one PTAG is running; or
\( 3> \) if CG-SDT procedure is ongoing and cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer is running:
4> if the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI and contains a UL grant for a new transmission:
\( 5> \) consider this Random Access Response reception successful;
5> stop the msgB-ResponseWindow;
\( 5> \) consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.
3> else:
\( 4> \) if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the C-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:
\( 5> \) if the MAC PDU contains the Absolute Timing Advance Command MAC CE:
