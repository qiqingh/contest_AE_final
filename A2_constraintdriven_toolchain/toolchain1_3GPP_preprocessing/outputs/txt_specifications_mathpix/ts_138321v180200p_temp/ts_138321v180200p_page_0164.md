1> if the configured sidelink grant has been activated and this PSSCH duration corresponds to the first PSSCH transmission opportunity within this sl-PeriodCG of the configured sidelink grant:
\( 2> \) set the SL-PRS Process ID to the SL-PRS Process ID associated with this PSSCH duration and, if available, all subsequent SL-PRS transmission occasion(s) occuring in this \( s l \)-PeriodCG for the configured sidelink grant;
\( 2> \) determine that this SL-PRS transmission occasion is used for initial transmission.
\( 1> \) process the sidelink grant according to clause 5.22.1.3.4 with the corresponding SL-PRS transmission information.

For configured sidelink grants not on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first slot of an SL transmission is derived from the following equation:
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\text { HARQ Process }[\mathrm{D}=[\text { floor }(\text { CURRENT slot } / \text { PeriodicityS } L)] \text { modulo } s l \text {-NrOfHARQ-Processes } \\
+s l \text {-HARQ-ProcID-offset }
\end{array}
\]

For configured sidelink grant on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, the SL-PRS Process ID associated with the first slot of an SL transmission is derived from the following equation:
\[
\text { SL-PRS Process }[D=[\text { floor(CURRENT_slot / PeriodicitySL) }] \text { modulo [nrOfSL-PRSProc] }
\]
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource pool, and PeriodicitySL is defined in clause 5.8.3.
5.22.1.2 TX resource (re-)selection check

If the TX resource (re-)selection check procedure is triggered on the selected pool of resources for a Sidelink process according to clause 5.22.1.1, the MAC entity shall for the Sidelink process:
\( 1> \) if PSCCH duration(s) and \( 2{ }^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI on PSSCH for all transmissions of a MAC PDU of any selected sidelink grant(s) are not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent; or

1> if SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER \( =0 \) and when SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER was equal to 1 the MAC entity randomly selected, with equal probability, a value in the interval \( [\overline{0}, 1] \) which is above the probability configured by RRC in sl-ProbResourceKeep; or
\( 1> \) if the pool of resources is configured or reconfigured by RRC; or
1> if there is no selected sidelink grant on the selected pool of resources; or
\( 1> \) if neither transmission nor retransmission has been performed by the MAC entity on any resource indicated in the selected sidelink grant during the last second; or
\( 1> \) if \( s \) /-ReselectAfter is configured and the number of consecutive unused transmission opportunities on resources indicated in the selected sidelink grant, which is incremented by 1 when none of the resources of the selected sidelink grant within a resource reservation interval is used, is equal to \( s / \)-ReselectAfter; or

1> if the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate a RLC SDU by using the maximum allowed MCS configured by RRC in sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH associated with the selected MCS table and the UE selects not to segment the RLC SDU; or

NOTE 1: If the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate the RLC SDU, it is left for UE implementation whether to perform segmentation or sidelink resource reselection.
\( 1> \) if transmission(s) with the selected sidelink grant cannot fulfil the remaining PDB of the data in a logical or the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission, if available channel, and the MAC entity selects not to perform transmission(s) corresponding to a single MAC PDU or SL-PRS transmission; or

1> if Sidelink consistent LBT failure is detected as specified in clause 5.31.2 in some RB set(s) of the selected resource pool that spans multiple RB sets for the logical channel, if single carrier frequency is configured; or
