4 randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources.
5.22.1.3 Sidelink HARQ operation and SL-PRS transmission
5.22.1.3.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity

The MAC entity is configured by upper layers to transmit using pool(s) of resources on one or more carriers as indicated in clause 5.8 .8 of TS 38.331 [5]. For each carrier, the MAC entity includes at most one Sidelink HARQ entity for transmission on SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.

The maximum number of transmitting Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is 16 . A sidelink process may be configured for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs. For transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 , the maximum number of transmitting Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is 4.

A delivered sidelink grant and its associated Sidelink transmission information are associated with a Sidelink process. Each Sidelink process supports one TB.

NOTE: For SL-PRS transmission on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, the maximum number of SL-PRS the UE should support is left to UE implementation.

For each sidelink grant, the Sidelink HARQ Entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity determines that the sidelink grant is used for initial transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.1; or
\( 1> \) if the sidelink grant is a configured sidelink grant and no MAC PDU has been obtained in an \( s / \)-PeriodCG of the configured sidelink grant; or
\( 1> \) if the sidelink grant is a dynamic sidelink grant or selected sidelink grant and no MAC PDU has been obtained in the previous sidelink grant when PSCCH duration(s) and \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI on PSSCH of the previous sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of any destination that has data to be sent:

NOTE 1: Void.
\( 2> \) (re-)associate a Sidelink process to this grant, and for the associated Sidelink process:
2 if all PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for initial transmission of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28 .3 of the destination that has data to be sent:
\( 3> \) ignore the sidelink grant.
NOTE 1A: The Sidelink HARQ Entity will associate the selected sidelink grant to the Sidelink process determined by the MAC entity.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) obtain the MAC PDU and SL-PRS, if any, to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity, if any;
3> if a MAC PDU to transmit has been obtained:
\( 4> \) if a HARQ Process ID has been set for the sidelink grant:
\( 5> \) (re-)associate the HARQ Process [D corresponding to the sidelink grant to the Sidelink process.
NOTE 1a: There is one-to-one mapping between a HARQ Process ID and a Sidelink process in the MAC entity configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1.
