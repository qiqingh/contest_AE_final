on the value of \( \mu \) specified in clause 5.3.2 in TS 38.211 [8] for \( \mu=\{0,1,2,3\} \), and for \( \mu=\{5,6\}, \mathrm{t} \) id is the index of the 120 kHz slot in a system frame that contains the PRACH occasion ( \( 0 \leq \mathrm{t} \_\mathrm{id}<80 \) ), f_id is the index of the PRACH occasion in the frequency domain ( \( 0 \leq \mathrm{f} \_\mathrm{id}<8 \) ), and ul_carrier_id is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble transmission (0 for NUL carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).
5.1.3a MSGA transmission

The MAC entity shall, for each MSGA:
1> if PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER is greater than one; and
\( 1> \) if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been received from lower layers; and
1> if LBT failure indication was not received from lower layers for the last MSGA Random Access Preamble transmission; and

1> if SSB selected is not changed from the selection in the last Random Access Preamble transmission:
\( 2> \) increment PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER by 1 .
\( 1> \) select the value of DELTA_PREAMBLE according to clause 7.3;
1> set PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER to msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower +
DELTA_PREAMBLE + (PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER - 1) × PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP;

1> if this is the first MSGA transmission within this Random Access procedure:
\( 2> \) if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:
3> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.
\( 2> \) if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery and spCell-BFR-CBRA with value true is configured:

3> if there is at least one Serving Cell of this MAC entity configured with two BFD-RS sets:
4> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include an Enhanced BFR MAC CE or a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

3> else:
4> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a BFR MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.
\( 2> \) else if the Random Access procedure was initiated for beam failure recovery of both BFD-RS sets of SpCell:
\( 3> \) indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include an Enhanced BFR MAC CE or a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.
\( 2> \) obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity according to the HARQ information determined for the MSGA payload (see clause 5.1.2a) and store it in the MSGA buffer.

1> compute the MSGB-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1> instruct the physical layer to transmit the MSGA using the selected PRACH occasion and the associated PUSCH resource of MSGA (if the selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion), using the corresponding RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI, PREAMBLE_INDEX,
PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER, msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower, and the amount of power ramping applied to the latest MSGA preamble transmission (i.e. (PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER \( -1) \times \) PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP);
\( 1> \) if LBT failure indication is received from lower layers for the transmission of this MSGA Random Access Preamble:
