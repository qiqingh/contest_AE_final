6.1.3.2 C-RNTI MAC CE

The C-RNTI MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2.
It has a fixed size and consists of a single field defined as follows (Figure 6.1 3.2-1):
- C-RNTI: This field contains the C-RNTI of the MAC entity. The length of the field is 16 bits.

6.1.3.3 UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC CE

The UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1.

It has a fixed 48-bit size and consists of a single field defined as follows (Figure 6.1 3.3-1):
- UE Contention Resolution Identity: This field contains the UL CCCH SDU. If the UL CCCH SDU is longer than 48 bits, this field contains the first 48 bits of the UL CCCH SDU.

6.1.3.4 Timing Advance Command MAC CE

The Timing Advance Command MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1.
It has a fixed size and consists of a single octet defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.4-1):
- TAG Identity (TAG ID): This field indicates the TAG Identity of the addressed TAG. The TAG with the Identity 0 contains the SpCell. The length of the field is 2 bits;
- Timing Advance Command: This field indicates the index value \( T_{A}(0,1,2 \ldots 63) \) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that MAC entity has to apply (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). The length of the field is 6 bits.
