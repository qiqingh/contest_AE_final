5.30 Handling of FR2 UL gap

During the FR2 UL gap configured by \( u \)-GapFR2-Config as specified in TS 38.331 [5], the MAC entity shall, on the Serving Cell(s) of FR2 single CC and intra-band CA, or on the Serving Cell(s) of FR2 inter-band CA where UE does not support tx-Support-UL-GapFR2:

1> only perform transmission of:
\( 2> \) PRACH preamble as specified in clause 5.1.2 and 5.1.2a;
2 UL-SCH for Msg3 or the MSGA payload as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\( 2> \) UL-SCH for configured grant;
\( 2> \) the valid CSI report during SCell activation procedure where the valid CSI report is valid CQI with non-zero CQI index defined in TS 38.214 [7], clause 5.2.2.1, when the time period between UL gap colliding with CSI report of non-zero CQI and the slot where the SCell activation MAC CE or CSI report activation command is received is no less than 10 ms ;
\( 2> \) the valid L1 RSRP report during SCell activation procedure, where the valid L1 RSRP report is non lowest L1 RSRP defined in TS 38.133 [11], clause 10.1.6, when the time period between UL gap colliding with L1
