- drx-onDurationTimerPTM or drx-InactivityTimerPTM or drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI is running.

When multicast DRX is not configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, and the cfr-ConfigMulticast is configured for at least one of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), and unicast DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall for this GRNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
\( 1> \) monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
\( 1> \) if the PDCCH indicates a DL multicast transmission; or
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink multicast assignment:
\( 2> \) stop the \( d r x \)-RetransmissionTimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process.
\( 1> \) if the PDCCH addressed to G-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission; or
\( 1> \) if the PDCCH addressed to G-CS-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission and CS-RNTI is configured; or
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink multicast assignment and CS-RNTI is configured:
\( 2> \) if the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode (i.e ack-nack) is used as specified in TS 38.213 [6]; and
2 if HARQ feedback for MBS multicast is enabled:
\( 3> \) if the MAC PDU is received on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
\( 4> \) set \( H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \) Timer \( D L \) plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 4> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) start the \( d r x \)-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.

When multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, and the cfr-ConfigMulticast is configured for at least one of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or when multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI for multicast in RRC_INACTVE, the MAC entity shall for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
\( 1> \) if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink multicast assignment:
\( 2> \) if HARQ feedback for MBS multicast is enabled:
\( 3> \) if the MAC PDU is received on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
\( 4> \) set \( H A R Q-R T T \)-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process equal to \( d r x-H A R Q-R T T \) Timer D L-PTM plus the latest available UE-gNB RTT value;
\( 4> \) start the HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM-NTN for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) start the drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback;
\( 3> \) if the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode (i.e. ack-nack) is used as specified in TS 38.213 [6]; and
\( 3> \) if CS-RNTI is configured:
4 if the MAC PDU is received on a non-terrestrial network and the UE supports harq-RTT-TimerDL-ForNTN-MulticastMBS-r17:
