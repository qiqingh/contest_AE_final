\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to transmit SCI according to the stored sidelink grant with the associated Sidelink transmission information;
\( 2> \) instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the stored sidelink grant;
\( 2> \) if HARQ feedback has been enabled for the MAC PDU according to clause 5.22.1.4.2:
\( 3> \) instruct the physical layer to monitor PSFCH for the transmission and perform PSFCH reception as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.
\( 2> \) if \( s \)-PUCCH-Config is configured by RRC for the stored sidelink grant:
\( 3> \) determine transmission of an acknowledgement on the PUCCH as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.
\( 1> \) if this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU and SL-PRS, if available:
\( 2> \) decrement SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER by 1, if available.
NOTE 1: If the number of \( H A R Q \) retransmissions selected by the MAC entity has been reached, or if a positive acknowledgement to a transmission of the MAC PDU has been received, or if a negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for the transmission of the MAC PDU, the MAC entity determines this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU for Sidelink resource allocation mode 2. How to determine the last transmission in other cases is up to UE implementation.
\( 1> \) if \( s \) /-MaxTransNum corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU has been configured in sl-CG-MaxTransNumList for the sidelink grant by RRC and the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has been reached to sl-MaxTransNum; or
\( 1> \) if a positive acknowledgement to this transmission of the MAC PDU was received according to clause 5.22.1.3.2, except a positive acknowledgement to Multi-consecutive slots transmission (i.e., multiple TBs case) of the MAC PDU and there is remaining slot(s) for this MAC PDU; or
\( 1> \) if negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for this transmission of the MAC PDU according to clause 5.22.1.3.2:
\( 2> \) flush the HARQ buffer of the associated Sidelink process.
The transmission of the MAC PDU or SL-PRS, if available, is prioritized over uplink transmission(s) of the MAC entity or the other MAC entity if the following conditions are met:
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission simultaneously with all uplink transmission(s) at the time of the transmission, and
\( 1> \) if none of the uplink transmission(s) is prioritized by upper layer according to TS 23.287 [19], and
\( 1> \) if none of the NR uplink MAC PDU(s) includes any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3, and
\( 1> \) if \( u \)-PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of the highest priority of logical channel(s) of all the NR uplink transmission(s) is not lower than \( u \)-PrioritizationThres, and
\( 1> \) if \( s \) /-PrioritizationThres is configured and if the value of the highest priority of logical channel(s) or MAC CE(s) in the MAC PDU is lower than sl-PrioritizationThres.

NOTE 2: If the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission simultaneously with all uplink transmissions as specified in clause 5.4.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and prioritization-related information is not available prior to the time of this sidelink transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this sidelink transmission is performed.
5.22.1.3.2 PSFCH reception

The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH transmission:
\( 1> \) if an acknowledgement corresponding to the PSSCH transmission in clause 5.22.1.3.1a is obtained from the physical layer:
