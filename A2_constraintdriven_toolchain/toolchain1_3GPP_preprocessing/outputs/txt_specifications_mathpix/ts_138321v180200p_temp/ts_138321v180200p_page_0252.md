octet containing the AC field, if any, is included for SCell(s) (in ascending order of the ServCellIndex), while not exceeding the available grant size. The number of the octets containing the AC field in the Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE can be zero.

The fields in the Enhanced BFR MAC CEs are defined as follows:
- SP (Enhanced BFR MAC CE): This field indicates beam failure detection (as specified in clause 5.17 ) for the SpCell of this MAC entity and the presence of octet(s) containing the AC field if the SpCell is configured with multiple BFD-RS sets. For the SpCell configured with two BFD-RS sets, this field set to 1 indicates that beam failure is detected for at least one BFD-RS set, the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed, and the octet(s) containing the AC field is present for the SpCell; otherwise, it is set to 0 . The octet(s) containing the AC field for SpCell are included before those of SCell(s). For the SpCell not configured with multiple BFD-RS sets, the SP field is set to 1 to indicate that beam failure is detected for SpCell when Enhanced BFR MAC CE is to be included into a MAC PDU as part of Random Access Procedure (as specified in 5.1.3a and 5.1.4); otherwise, it is set to 0;
- SP (Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE): This field indicates beam failure detection (as specified in clause 5.17) for the SpCell of this MAC entity. For the SpCell configured with two BFD-RS sets, this field set to 1 indicates that beam failure is detected for at least one BFD-RS set, the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed, and the octet(s) containing the AC field may be present for the SpCell; otherwise, it is set to 0 . For the SpCell not configured with multiple BFD-RS sets, the SP field is set to 1 to indicate that beam failure is detected for SpCell when Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE is to be included into a MAC PDU as part of Random Access Procedure (as specified in 5.1.3a and 5.1.4); otherwise, it is set to 0 ;
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) (Enhanced BFR MAC CE): This field indicates beam failure detection (as specified in clause 5.17) and the presence of octet(s) containing the AC field for the SCell with ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 1 indicates that beam failure is detected for the SCell or at least one BFD-RS set of the SCell, the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed, and the octet(s) containing the AC field is present for the SCell with ServCellIndex i. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 0 indicates either that the beam failure is not detected for the SCell or any BFD-RS set of the SCell, and the octet(s) containing the AC field is not present for the SCell with ServCellIndex \( i \); or that the beam failure is detected for the SCell or at least one BFD-RS set of the SCell but the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has not been completed, and the octets containing the AC field is not present for the SCell with ServCelllndex i . The octets containing the AC field are present in ascending order based on the ServCellIndex and are included after the octet(s) containing the AC field for SpCell, if any;
- \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) (Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE): This field indicates beam failure detection (as specified in clause 5.17) for the SCell with ServCellIndex i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 1 indicates that beam failure is detected for the SCell or at least one BFD-RS set of the SCell, the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed, and the octet(s) containing the AC field for the SCell with ServCelllndex i may be present. The \( \mathrm{C}_{1} \) field set to 0 indicates either that the beam failure is not detected for the SCell or any BFD-RS set of the SCell, and the octet(s) containing the AC field is not present for the SCell with ServCellIndex \( i \); or that the beam failure is detected for the SCell or at least one BFD-RS set of the SCell but the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has not been completed, and the octet(s) containing the AC field is not present for the SCell with ServCellIndex i;
- \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) (Enhanced BFR MAC CE): This field corresponds to the \( \mathrm{k}^{\text {th }} \) Serving Cell for which SP/C field is set to 1 and is configured with two BFD-RS sets. The Serving Cells for which SP/C1 field is set to 1 and are configured with two BFD-RS sets, are indexed sequentially starting with SpCell and followed by SCells in ascending order of ServCellIndex i. This field indicates whether beam failure is detected for one or both BFD-RS sets and presence of one or two octets containing the AC field of the Serving Cell. The \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 1 indicates that beam failure is detected for both the BFD-RS sets, the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed for both the BFD-RS sets, and the octets containing the AC field are present for both the BFD-RS sets, of the Serving Cell. The \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field set to 0 indicates that beam failure is either detected for one of the BFD-RS sets and the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been completed or beam failure is detected for both the BFD-RS sets but the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has not been completed for both the BFD-RS sets, and the octet containing the AC field is present for only one BFDRS set of the Serving Cell. The \( \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{k}} \) field not mapped to any Serving Cell is set to 0 ;
