\( 4> \) deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
\( 2> \) else if the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process is configured and not running, then for the corresponding HARQ process:
\( 3> \) if the configuredGrantTimer is not running, and the HARQ process is not pending (i.e. new transmission):

4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;
\( 4> \) deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
\( 3> \) else if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was a configured uplink grant (i.e. retransmission on configured grant):
\( 4> \) deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
\( 2> \) else if the cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer is configured and not running for the corresponding HARQ process; or
\( 2> \) if the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer is configured and not running for the corresponding HARQ process:
3> if the configured uplink grant is for the first PUSCH transmission at RACH-less LTM cell switch (i.e., initial new transmission); or
\( 3> \) if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission of RACH-less handover (i.e., initial new transmission); or

3> if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission for the CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., initial new transmission); or

3> if the configuredGrantTimer is not running or not configured, and PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity's C-RNTI has been received after the initial transmission of the CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., subsequent new transmission):

4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;
\( 4> \) deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
3> if PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity's C-RNTI has not been received and if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was a configured uplink grant for initial transmission of CG-SDT with CCCH message or for its retransmission (i.e., retransmission for initial CG-SDT transmission); or

3> if RACH-less handover is not successfully completed and if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was a configured uplink grant for initial transmission of RACH-less handover or for its retransmission (i.e., retransmission for initial RACH-less handover transmission); or

3> if RACH-less LTM cell switch is not successfully completed and if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was a configured uplink grant for first PUSCH transmission at RACH-less LTM cell switch or for its retransmission (i.e., retransmission for initial transmission at RACH-less LTM cell switch):

4> consider the NDI bit to have not been toggled;
\( 4> \) deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
For configured uplink grants that are not part of a multi-PUSCH configured grant and neither configured with harq-ProcID-Offset2 nor with cg-RetransmissionTimer, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID \( =[ \) floor(CURRENT_symbol/periodicity) \( ] \) modulo nrofHARQ-Processes
