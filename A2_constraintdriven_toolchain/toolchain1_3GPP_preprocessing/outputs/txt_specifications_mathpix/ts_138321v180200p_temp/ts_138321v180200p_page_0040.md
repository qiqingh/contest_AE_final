1> if SSB or CSI-RS selected is not changed from the selection in the last Random Access Preamble transmission; and
\( 1> \) if the Random Access procedure is not initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell:
2 increment PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER by 1 .
1> if the Random Access procedure is initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell as preamble retransmission; and

1> if the PDCCH order indicates the same LTM candidate cell and the same SSB as the last Random Access Preamble transmission:
\( 2> \) increment PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER by 1 .
1> select the value of DELTA_PREAMBLE according to clause 7.3;
1> set PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER to preambleReceivedTargetPower + DELTA_PREAMBLE + (PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER -1 ) × PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP + POWER_OFFSET_2STEP_RA;

1> except for contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure recovery request and contention-free Random Access Preamble triggered by a PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell, compute the RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;
\( 1> \) instruct the physical layer to transmit the Random Access Preamble using the selected PRACH occasion, corresponding RA-RNTI (if available), PREAMBLE_INDEX, and PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER.

1> if the Random Access Procedure is triggered by a PDCCH order for an LTM candidate cell:
\( 2> \) consider this Random Access procedure completed.
1> if LBT failure indication is received from lower layers for this Random Access Preamble transmission:
\( 2> \) if \( l b t \)-FailureRecoveryConfig is configured:
3> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause 5.1.2).
\( 2> \) else:
3> increment PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER by 1 ;
3> if PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER \( = \) preambleTransMax +1 :
4/ if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on the SpCell:
\( 5> \) indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers;
5> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:
\( 6> \) consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.
4> else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on an SCell:
\( 5> \) consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.
3> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:
\( 4> \) perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause 5.1.2).
The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted or the RARNTI associated with the last valid PRACH occasion in the set of PRACH occasions (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) for Msg1 repetition, is computed as:
\[
\text { RA-RNTI }=1+\text { s_id }+14 \times \text { t_id }+14 \times 80 \times \text { f_id }+14 \times 80 \times 8 \times \text { ul_carrier_id }
\]
where s_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the PRACH occasion ( \( 0 \leq s \_i d<14 \) ), t_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH occasion in a system frame ( \( 0 \leq \mathrm{t} \_\mathrm{id}<80 \) ), where the subcarrier spacing to determine \( \mathrm{t} \_ \)id is based
