A MAC CE is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length.
A MAC subheader is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. Each MAC subheader is placed immediately in front of the corresponding MAC SDU, MAC CE, or padding.

The MAC entity shall ignore the value of the Reserved bits in downlink MAC PDUs.
6.1.2 MAC PDU (DL-SCH and UL-SCH except transparent MAC and Random Access Response)

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Each MAC subPDU consists of one of the following:
- AMAC subheader only (including padding);
- A MAC subheader and a MAC SDU;
- AMAC subheader and a MAC CE;
- AMAC subheader and padding.

The MAC SDUs are of variable sizes.
Each MAC subheader corresponds to either a MAC SDU, a MAC CE, or padding.
A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L. A MAC subheader for fixed sized MAC CE and padding consists of the header fields R/LCID/(eLCID). A MAC subheader for a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields (LX)/R/LCID.
