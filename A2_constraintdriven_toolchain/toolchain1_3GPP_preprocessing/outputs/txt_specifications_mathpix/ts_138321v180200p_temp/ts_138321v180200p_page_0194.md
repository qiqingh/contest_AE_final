3> update the stored the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference with the current RSRP value of the downlink pathloss reference.
\( 2> \) if the UE is configured with SRS with validity area and the upper layer indicates the MAC to update the stored RSRP:

3> update the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference with the current RSRP value of the downlink pathloss reference of the camped cell as specified in TS 38.331 [5].

The MAC entity shall consider the TA to be valid when the following conditions are fulfilled:
\( 1> \) compared to the stored downlink pathloss reference RSRP value, the current RSRP value of the downlink pathloss reference of the camped cell as specified in TS 38.331 [5] has not increased/decreased by more than inactivePosSRS-RSRP-ChangeThreshold, if configured; and
\( 1> \) inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer is running or inactivePosSRS-ValidityAreaTAT is running when positioning validity area is configured.
5.27 Small Data Transmission
5.27.1 General

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with SDT and the SDT procedure may be initiated by RRC layer for MOSDT or MT-SDT. The SDT procedure initiated for MO-SDT can be performed either by Random Access procedure with 2-step RA type or 4-step RA type (i.e., RA-SDT) or by configured grant Type 1 (i.e., CG-SDT). The SDT procedure initiated for MT-SDT can be performed either by Random Access procedure with 2-step RA type or 4-step RA type (i.e., RA-SDT is not applicable as specified in clause 5.1 lb) or by configured grant Type 1 (i.e., CG-SDT).

RRC configures the following parameters for SDT procedure:
- sdt-DataVolumeThreshold: data volume threshold for the UE to determine whether to perform SDT procedure initiated for MO-SDT;
- sdt-RSRP-Threshold: RSRP threshold for UE to determine whether to perform SDT procedure initiated for MOSDT;
- mt-SDT-RSRP-Threshold: RSRP threshold for UE to determine whether to perform SDT procedure initiated for MT-SDT;
- cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB: an RSRP threshold configured for SSB selection for CG-SDT;
- cg-MT-SDT-MaxDurationToNextCG-Occasion: time threshold which is used by the UE to determine whether to perform CG-SDT for MT-SDT;
- cg-SDT-MaxDurationToNextCG-Occasion: time threshold configured per logical channel which is used by the UE to determine whether to perform CG-SDT for MO-SDT;
- sdt-BeamFailureRecoveryProhibitTimer: prohibit timer to avoid frequent triggering of Random Access procedure due to beam failure recovery during RA-SDT procedure or during MT-SDT procedure initiated by Random Access procedure.

The following UE variable is used for the SDT procedure:
- MAX_DURATION_TO_NEXT_CG_OCCASION;
- RSRP_THRESHOLD.

The MAC entity shall, if initiated by the upper layers for SDT procedure:
1> if SDT procedure is initiated for MO-SDT as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
2> set the MAX_DURATION_TO_NEXT_CG_OCCASION to the shortest value of cg-SDT-
MaxDurationToNextCG-Occasion, if configured, among all the logical channels configured with this parameter by upper layer and having data for transmission;
