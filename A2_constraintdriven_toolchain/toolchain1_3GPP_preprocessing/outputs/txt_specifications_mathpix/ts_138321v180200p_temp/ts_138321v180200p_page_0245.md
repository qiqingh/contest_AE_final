6.1.3.35 Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE

The Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as specified in Table 6.2.4-1. The priority of the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE is fixed to '1'. The Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE is defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.35-1):
- RI: This field indicates the derived value of the Rank Indicator for sidelink CSI reporting as specified in clause 8.5 of TS 38.214 [7]. The length of the field is 1 bit, the values of the rank indicator field are mapped to allowed rank indicator values with increasing order, where ' 0 ' is mapped to the smallest allowed rank indicator value;
- CQI: This field indicates the derived value of the Channel Quality Indicator for sidelink CSI reporting as specified in clause 8.5 of TS 38.214 [7]. The length of the field is 4 bit;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

6.1.3.36 SP Positioning SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE

The SP Positioning SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a variable size with following fields:
- A/D: This field indicates whether to activate or deactivate indicated SP Positioning SRS resource set. The field is set to 1 to indicate activation, otherwise it indicates deactivation;
- Positioning SRS Resource Set's Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell, which contains activated/deactivated SP Positioning SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the Serving Cell which contains all resources indicated by the Spatial Relation for Resource ID, fields, if present. The length of the field is 5 bits;
- Positioning SRS Resource Set's BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP as the codepoint of the DCI bandwidth part indicator field as specified in TS 38.212 [9], which contains activated/deactivated SP Positioning SRS Resource Set. If the C field is set to 0 , this field also indicates the identity of the BWP which contains all resources indicated by the Spatial Relation for Resource [D, fields, if present. The length of the field is 2 bits;
- C: This field indicates whether the octets containing Resource Serving Cell ID field(s) and Resource BWP ID field(s) within the field Spatial Relation for Resource ID, are present, except for Spatial Relation Resource ID, with DL-PRS or SSB. When A/D is set to 1 , if this field is set to 1 , the octets containing Resource Serving Cell ID field(s) and Resource BWP ID field(s) in the field Spatial Relation for Resource ID, are present, otherwise if this field is set to 0 , they are not present. When \( A / D \) is set to 0 , this field is always set to 0 that they are not present;
- SUL: This field indicates whether the MAC CE applies to the NUL carrier or SUL carrier configuration. This field is set to 1 to indicate that it applies to the SUL carrier configuration, and it is set to 0 to indicate that it applies to the NUL carrier configuration;
- Positoining SRS Resource Set ID: This field indicates the SP Positioning SRS Resource Set identified by SRSPosResourceSetld as specified in TS 38.331 [5], which is to be activated or deactivated. The length of the field is 4 bits;
