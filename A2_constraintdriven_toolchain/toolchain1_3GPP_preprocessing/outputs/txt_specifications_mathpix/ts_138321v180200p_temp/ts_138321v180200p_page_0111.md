1> else:
\( 2> \) consider this configured uplink grant as not valid;
\( 2> \) initiate Random Access procedure in clause 5.1.
NOTE 1A: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above cg-RRC-RSRP-ThresholdSSB or cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB, the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP measurement.

After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the configured uplink grant, or the first configured uplink grant in a multi-PUSCH configured grant, in the \( \mathrm{N}^{\text {th }}(\mathrm{N} \geq 0) \) periodicity occurs in the symbol for which:
```
                [(SFN × numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot)
\( +( \) slot number in the frame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot \( )+ \) symbol number in the slot \( ]= \)
            [(SFN \( \mathrm{N}_{\text {start ume }} \times \) numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot
        + slot \( _{\text {start ture }} \times \) numberOfSymbolsPerSlot + symbol \( \left._{\text {start ture }}\right)+\mathrm{N} \times \) periodicity]
            modulo ( \( 1024 \times \) numberOfSlotsPerFrame × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot)
```

where \( \mathrm{SFN}_{\text {start tume }} \), \( \operatorname{slot}_{\text {start tume }} \), and symbol \( { }_{\text {start tume }} \) are the SFN, slot, and symbol, respectively, of the first transmission opportunity of PUSCH where the configured uplink grant was (re-)initialised.

For a multi-PUSCH configured grant Type 2, the \( \mathrm{M}^{\text {th }}(1<\mathrm{M} \leq \) nrofSlotsInCG-Period) configured uplink grant within the same periodicity occurs (M-1) × numberOfSymbolsPerSlot symbols after the symbol in which the first configured uplink grant in that periodicity occurs.

If cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot or cg-nrofNlots is configured for a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider the uplink grants occur in those additional PUSCH allocations as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7].

NOTE 2: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured uplink grants.

When the configured uplink grant is released by upper layers, all the corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding uplink grants shall be cleared.

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if at least one configured uplink grant confirmation has been triggered and not cancelled; and
1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
\( 2> \) if, in this MAC entity, at least one configured uplink grant is configured by
configuredGrantConfigToAddModList:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.31.
\( 2> \) else:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.7.
\( 2> \) cancel all triggered configured uplink grant confirmation(s).
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the configured uplink grant(s) immediately after first transmission of Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE or Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE which confirms the configured uplink grant deactivation.

Retransmissions use:
- repetition of configured uplink grants; or
- received uplink grants addressed to CS-RNTI; or
- configured uplink grants with cg-RetransmissionTimer, cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer or cg-SDTRetransmissionTimer configured
