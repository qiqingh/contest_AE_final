\( 5> \) select any resource pool among the resource pool(s) allowing for SL-PRS transmission.
\( 4> \) else:
\( 5> \) select any pool of resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in \( s l-B W P \) -
DiscPoolConfig, sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, sl-BWP-PoolConfigA2X or sl-BWP-
PoolConfigCommonA2X, if configured or Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool, if configured.
\( 3> \) else (i.e. multiple carrier frequencies are configured):
\( 4> \) trigger the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure as specified in clause 5.22.1.11.
\( 2> \) if Sidelink consistent LBT failure is detected as specified in clause 5.31 .2 in all RB sets of the selected resource pool, if single carrier frequency is configured:
\( 3> \) if \( s \) /-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to enabled for the logical channel:
4 select any pool of resources configured with PSFCH resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, if configured and the pool(s) in which all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) select any pool of resources among the pools of resources except the pool(s) in sl-BWPDiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon, if configured and the pool(s) in which all RB sets had Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled.
\( 2> \) perform the TX resource (re-)selection check on the selected pool of resources as specified in clause 5.22.1.2;
NOTE 2D: It is up to UE implementation how to select a resource pool that has at least one RB set in which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was either not detected or detected but cancelled.

NOTE 3: The MAC entity continuously performs the TX resource (re-)selection check until the corresponding pool of resources is released by RRC or the MAC entity decides to cancel creating a selected sidelink grant corresponding to transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs.
\( 2> \) if the TX resource (re-)selection is triggered as the result of the TX resource (re-)selection check:
\( 3> \) if \( s l- \) bt-FailureRecoveryConfig is configured in the SL BWP:
\( 4> \) indicate to the physical layer RB set information for which Sidelink consistent LBT failure was detected and not cancelled as specified in clause 5.31.2.
\( 3> \) if the TX carrier (re-)selection procedure was triggered in above and one or more carriers have been (re-)selected in the TX carrier (re-)selection according to clause 5.22.1.11:
\( 4> \) determine the order of the (re-)selected carriers, according to the decreasing order based on the highest priority of logical channels which are allowed on each (re-)selected carrier, and perform the resource selection procedure as specified in this clause for each Sidelink process on each (re-)selected carrier according to the order.
\( 3> \) if one or multiple SL DRX(s) is configured in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data:
\( 4> \) indicate to the physical layer SL DRX Active time in the destination UE(s) receiving SL-SCH data, as specified in clause 5.28.2.

NOTE 3A: The MAC entity selects a value for the resource reservation interval which is larger than the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel or remaining SL-PRS delay budget. The value of the SL-PRS delay budget is provided by the UE's own upper layers by implementation.
\( 3> \) randomly select, with equal probability, an integer value in the interval [5,15] for the resource reservation interval higher than or equal to 100 ms or in the interval \( \left[5 \times\left\lceil\frac{100}{\max \left(20, P_{\text {rsvp_Tx }}\right)}\right\rceil, 15 \times\left\lceil\frac{100}{\max \left(20, P_{\text {rsvp_Tx }}\right)}\right\rceil\right] \) for the resource reservation interval lower than 100 ms and set SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER to the selected value;
\( 3> \) if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
