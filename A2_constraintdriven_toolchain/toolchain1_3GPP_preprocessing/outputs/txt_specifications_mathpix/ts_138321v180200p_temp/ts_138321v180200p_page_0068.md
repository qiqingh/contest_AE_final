ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

NOTE: When a single DCI is used to schedule multiple PUSCH , the UE is allowed to map generated TB(s) internally to different HARQ processes in case of LBT failure(s), i.e. UE may transmit a new TB on any HARQ process in the grants that have the same TBS, the same RV and the NDIs indicate new transmission.

The maximum number of transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic grant or configured grant or the uplink grant received in a MAC RAR is given by REPETITION_NUMBER as follows:
- For a dynamic grant, REPETITION_NUMBER is set to a value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7];
- For a configured grant, REPETITION_NUMBER is set to a value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7];
- For an uplink grant received in a MAC RAR, REPETITION_NUMBER is set to a value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7].

If REPETITION_NUMBER \( >1 \), after the first transmission within a bundle, at most REPETITION_NUMBER -1 HARQ retransmissions follow within the bundle. For both dynamic grant and configured uplink grant, and uplink grant received in a MAC RAR bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same bundle. Within a bundle, HARQ retransmissions are triggered without waiting for feedback from previous transmission according to REPETITION_NUMBER for a dynamic grant or configured uplink grant or uplink grant received in a MAC RAR unless they are terminated as specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. Each transmission within a bundle is a separate uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity.

For each transmission within a bundle of the dynamic grant or uplink grant received in a MAC RAR, the sequence of redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. For each transmission within a bundle of the configured uplink grant, the sequence of redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7].

For each uplink grant, the HARQ entity shall:
\( 1> \) identify the HARQ process associated with this grant, and for each identified HARQ process:
\( 2> \) if the received grant was not addressed to a Temporary C-RNTI on PDCCH, and the NDI provided in the associated HARQ information has been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission of this TB of this HARQ process; or

2 if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI and the HARQ buffer of the identified process is empty; or
\( 2> \) if the uplink grant was received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC RAR or a fallback RAR); or
\( 2> \) if the uplink grant was determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload; or
\( 2> \) if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in ra-ResponseWindow and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery; or
\( 2> \) if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and may be used for initial transmission according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7], and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle:

3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload was selected; or

3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant was received in a fallbackRAR and this fallbackRAR successfully completed the Random Access procedure:
\( 4> \) obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received in a fallbackRAR:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received in a MAC RAR; or
