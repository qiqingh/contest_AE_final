4> consider the first set of transmission opportunities as the initial transmission opportunities and the other set(s) of transmission opportunities as the retransmission opportunities;
\( 4> \) consider the sets of initial transmission opportunities and retransmission opportunities as the selected sidelink grant.

3> else if one or more HARQ retransmissions are selected and the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is not configured by RRC:
\( 5> \) if transmission based on full sensing or partial sensing is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resources indicated by the physical layer according to clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for more transmission opportunities; or
\( 5> \) if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers and there are available resources left in the resource pool for more transmission opportunities:

\( 8> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 7> \) when SCS of NR SL is (pre-)configured as \( \mu=1 \) :
\( 8> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources in the second of NR SL slots of NR SL slots overlapping with an LTE SL subframe to which the selected transmission resources belongs, or select the time and frequency resources in the first of NR SL slots overlapping with an LTE SL subframe for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

6> else:
\( 7> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources which occur within the SL DRX Active time, if configured, as specified in clause 5.28 .2 of the destination UE selected for indicating to the physical layer the SL DRX Active time above, and the pool(s) in which all RB sets with Sidelink consistent LBT failure detected and not cancelled and the resources of which the lowest sub-channel includes intra cell guard band PRBs if \( s \) transmissionStructureForPSCCHandPSSCH is set to 'contiguousRB' are excluded, if configured, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
