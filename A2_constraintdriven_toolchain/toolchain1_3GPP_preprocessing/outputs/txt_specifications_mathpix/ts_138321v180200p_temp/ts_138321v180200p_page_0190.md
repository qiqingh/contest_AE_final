5.22.2.2.2 Sidelink process

For each PSSCH duration where a transmission takes place for the Sidelink process, one TB and the associated HARQ information is received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity.

For each received TB and SL-PRS, if available and associated Sidelink transmission information, the Sidelink process shall:

1> if this is a new transmission:
\( 2> \) attempt to decode the received data.
\( 1> \) else if this is a retransmission:
\( 2> \) if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined data.
\( 1> \) if the sidelink transmission information in the SCI indicates SL-PRS transmission:
\( 2> \) if the SL-PRS transmission is associated to unicast:
3> if the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI; and

3> if the SRC field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 16 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 8 LSB are equal to the Source ID in the corresponding SCI:
\( 4> \) instruct the physical layer to perform SL-PRS reception.
\( 2> \) else if the SL-PRS tnramission is associated with groupcast or broadcast:
3> if the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI:
\( 4> \) instruct the physical layer to perform SL-PRS reception.
\( 1> \) if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully decoded for this TB; or
\( 1> \) if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
\( 2> \) if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
3> if this TB is associated to unicast and the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI:

4> if the SRC field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 16 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 8 LSB are equal to the Source ID in the corresponding SCI; or

4> if this TB is corresponding to the logical channel with LCID equal to 0 or 1 and determined to be the first TB:
\( 5> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
3> if this TB is associated to groupcast or broadcast:
4> if the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI; or

4> if this TB is corresponding to the logical channel with LCID equal to 58 , and the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI:
