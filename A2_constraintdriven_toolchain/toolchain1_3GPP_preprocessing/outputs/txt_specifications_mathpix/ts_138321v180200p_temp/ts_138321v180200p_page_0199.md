sl-drx-SlotOffset (ms) \( =( \) Destination Layer-2 [D modulo the number of slots in one subframe)
/the number of slots in one subframe) (ms).
\( 1> \) if the SL DRX cycle is used, and [(DFN \( \times 10 \) ) + subframe number] modulo (sl-drx-Cycle or sl-DRX-GC-BCCycle \( )=s \)-drx-StartOffset:
\( 2> \) start \( s l \)-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer after sl-drx-SlotOffset from the beginning of the subframe.
\( 1> \) if an SL DRX is in Active Time:
\( 2> \) monitor the SCI (i.e., \( 1^{\text {st }} \) stage SCI and \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI).
\( 2> \) if the SCI indicates a new SL transmission:
\( 3> \) if Source Layer-1 ID of the SCI is equal to the 8 LSB of the intended Destination Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-1 ID of the SCI is equal to the 16 LSB of the intended Source Layer-2 ID and the cast type indicator in the SCI is set to unicast:

4> start or restart \( s \)-drx-InactivityTimer for the corresponding Source Layer-2 [D and Destination Layer2 [D pair in the first slot after SCI reception.
\( 3> \) if Destination Layer-1 ID of the SCI (i.e., \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) stage SCI) is equal to the 16 LSB of the intended Destination Layer-2 ID and the cast type indicator in the SCI is set to groupcast:
\( 4> \) start or restart \( s \)-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer for the corresponding Destination Layer-2 ID in the first slot after SCI reception.
\( 2> \) if the SCI indicates an SL transmission:
\( 3> \) if a next retransmission opportunity is indicated in the SCI:
\( 4> \) derive the \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer from the retransmission resource timing of the next retransmission resource in the SCI.
\( 3> \) else if PSFCH resource is configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
\( 4> \) set the \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer based on \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer \( l \) configured by upper layer if the cast type associated with the SCI is unicast or sl-DRX-GC-HARQ-RTT-Timer \( I \) configured by upper layer if the cast type associated with the SCI is groupcast when HARQ feedback is enabled, or based on \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer 2 configured by upper layer if the cast type associated with the SCI is unicast or sl-DRX-GC-HARQ-RTT-Timer 2 configured by upper layer if the cast type associated with the SCI is groupcast when HARQ feedback is disabled, for resource pool configured with PSFCH.
\( 3> \) else (i.e., if PSFCH resource is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI):
\( 4> \) set the sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer as 0 slots.
\( 3> \) if PSFCH resource is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
\( 4> \) start the \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer for the corresponding Sidelink process in the slot following the end of PSSCH transmission (i.e., currently received PSSCH).
\( 3> \) if PSFCH resource is configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
4 - if HARQ feedback is enabled by the SCI and the cast type associated with the SCI is unicast:
\( 5> \) if \( s \)-NumPSFCH-Occasions is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
\( 6> \) start the \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer for the corresponding Sidelink process in the first slot after the end of corresponding PSFCH transmission carrying the SL HARQ Feedback when the SL HARQ feedback is successfully transmitted in one of PSFCH occasions from s/-NumPSFCHOccasions; or
\( 6> \) start the \( s l \)-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer for the corresponding Sidelink process in the first slot after the end of the last PSFCH occasion for the SL HARQ Feedback when the SL HARQ feedback is not transmitted in all PSFCH occasions from sl-NumPSFCH-Occasions.
