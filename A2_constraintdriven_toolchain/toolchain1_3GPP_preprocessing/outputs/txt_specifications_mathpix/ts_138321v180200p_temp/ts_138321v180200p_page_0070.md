6> start or restart the configuredGrantTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.
\( 5> \) if cg-RetransmissionTimer is configured for the identified HARQ process; and
\( 5> \) if the transmission is performed and LBT failure indication is received from lower layers:
\( 6> \) consider the identified HARQ process as pending.
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4> \) flush the HARQ buffer of the identified HARQ process.
\( 2> \) else (i.e retransmission):
\( 3> \) if the uplink grant received on PDCCH was addressed to CS-RNTI and if the HARQ buffer of the identified process is empty; or
\( 3> \) if the uplink grant is part of a bundle and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle; or
\( 3> \) if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR) or an uplink grant determined as specified in clause 5.1 .2 a for MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or
\( 3> \) if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization and the BWP is not configured with \( s T x \) 2Panel, and if this uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with a PUSCH duration of another uplink grant received on the PDCCH; or
\( 3> \) if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization and the BWP is configured with sTx2Panel, and if this uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant associated with an srsResourceSetld corresponding to a coresetPoollndex, and the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with a PUSCH duration of another uplink grant received on the PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex; or
\( 3> \) if the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization and this uplink grant is not a prioritized uplink grant:
\( 4> \) ignore the uplink grant.
\( 3> \) else:
4 deliver the uplink grant and the HARQ information (redundancy version) of the TB to the identified HARQ process;
\( 4> \) instruct the identified HARQ process to trigger a retransmission;
4 if the uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTL; or
\( 4> \) if the uplink grant is addressed to C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant:
\( 5> \) start or restart the configuredGrantTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.

4> if the uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
\( 5> \) if the identified HARQ process is pending:
\( 6> \) start or restart the configuredGrantTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers;
\( 5> \) start or restart the cg-RetransmissionTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.
\( 5> \) if the configured uplink grant is for the retransmission of the initial transmission of the CG-SDT with CCCH message:
