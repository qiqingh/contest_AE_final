\( 5> \) if there are available resources left in the intersection of the received preferred resource set and the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] for more transmission opportunities:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources within the intersection for a MAC PDU to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].
\( 5> \) if the number of time and frequency resources that has been maximally selected for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources within the intersection is smaller than the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and there are available resources left in the resources indicated by the physical layer for more transmission opportunities:
\( 6> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for the remaining transmission opportunities except for the selected resources within the intersection from the available resources outside the intersection but left in the resources indicated by the physical layer according to clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE does not have own sensing result as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7] and if a preferred resource set is received from a UE; and
\( 4> \) if there are available resources left in the received preferred resource set for more transmission opportunities:
\( 5> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources belonging to the received preferred resource set for a MAC PDU to be transmitted to the UE providing the preferred resource set, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

4> if sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC and when the UE determines the resources for Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission upon explicit request from a UE:
\( 5> \) randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1 .4 of TS 38.214 [7], according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) allowed on the carrier, and/or the latency requirement of the triggered SL-CSI reporting and the latency requirement of the Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available.

4> consider a transmission opportunity which comes first in time as the initial transmission opportunity and other transmission opportunities as the retransmission opportunities;
\( 4> \) consider all the transmission opportunities as the selected sidelink grant.
