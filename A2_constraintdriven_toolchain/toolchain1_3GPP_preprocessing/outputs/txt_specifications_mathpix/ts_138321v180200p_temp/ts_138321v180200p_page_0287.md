Figure 6.1.3.65-1: Timing Case Indication MAC CE
6.1.3.66 NCR Downlink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE

The NCR Downlink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a fixed size and consists of a single octet defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.66-1):
- Downlink TCI state ID: This field is used to indicate the downlink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. It contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits), as specified in TS 38.331 [5], of a TCI State in the active DL BWP. The length of the field is 7 bits;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .

6.1.3.67 NCR Uplink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE

The NCR Uplink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a fixed size and consists of a single octet defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.67-1):
- Uplink TCI state ID or SRS Resource ID: This field is used to indicate the uplink beam to be used for backhaul link transmission. If the dl-OrJointTCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and unifiedTCIStateType is configured with a value joint, this field contains TCI-Stateld (comprising all 7 bits) of a Joint TCI State configured in the active DL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission. If the ul-TCI-StateList is configured as specified in TS 38.331 [5], this field contains TCI-UL-State-Id (contained in the 6 rightmost bits) of an UL TCI State configured in the active UL BWP, which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero. Otherwise, 6 rightmost bits of this field contain SRS-ResourceID configured in the active UL BWP which is used as the uplink beam indication for backhaul link transmission, with the 1 remaining bit set to zero;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
