NOTE 6: For the selected sidelink grant corresponds to transmissions of multiple MAC PDU, it is up to UE implementation whether to apply re-evaluation check to the resources in non-initial reservation period that have been signalled neither in the immediate last nor in the current period.
5.22.1.2b Re-selection for using a received resource conflict indication

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 or Sidelink resource allocation scheme 2 to transmit using pool(s) of resources in a carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] based on full sensing, or partial sensing or random selection or any combination(s), the MAC entity shall for each Sidelink process:
\( 1> \) if \( s \)-interUECoordinationScheme 2 enabling reception/transmission of a resource conflict indication is configured by RRC; and

1> if the next resource of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a prior SCI is overlapped with conflict resource(s) indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 16.3.1 of TS 38.213 [6]:
\( 2> \) remove the resource from the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process;
\( 2> \) randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] excluding the conflict resource(s) for the removed resource, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget for SL-PRS transmission, if available, by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources, and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9];

NOTE 1: If retransmission resource cannot be selected by ensuring that the resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI, how to select the time and frequency resource for more transmission opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources.
\( 2> \) replace the removed resource by the selected resource for the selected sidelink grant.
NOTE 2: It is left for UE implementation to reselect any pre-selected but not reserved resource(s) other than the resource overlapping with the conflict resource(s) indicated by the physical layer during reselection triggered by the conflict resource(s) indicated by the physical layer.

NOTE 3: It is up to UE implementation whether and how to set the resource reservation interval in the re-selected resource to replace the resource overlapping with the conflict resource(s) indicated by the physical layer.
5.22.1.2c Resource re-selection from SL LBT Failure indication

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 to transmit using pool(s) of resources in a carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [5] based on sensing or random selection the MAC entity shall for each Sidelink process:

1> if SL LBT failure indication is received from lower layers:
\( 2> \) for the resource(s) where SL LBT failure is detected from the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process:

3> if transmission based on random selection is configured by upper layers:
4> randomly select the time and frequency resources for one transmission opportunity from the resource pool excluding all RB sets for which Sidelink consistent LBT failures were detected and not cancelled, if configured according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of SL data available in the logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources.
