\( 1> \) else: (i.e., the sidelink grant is associated with Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool)
\( 2> \) select a Destination corresponding to the cast type of the SL grant and having pending SL-PRS transmission(s) with the highest priority for the SL grant associated to the SCI.
\( 1> \) select the logical channels satisfying all the following conditions among the logical channels belonging to the selected Destination when the new transmission is not associated to a sidelink grant on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool:
\( 2> \) SL data is available for transmission; and
\( 2>s \)-configuredGrantTypelAllowed, if configured, is set to true in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and.
\( 2>s \)-AllowedCG-List, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and
\( 2> \) allowed on the carrier where the SCI is transmitted, if the carrier is configured by upper layers according to TS 38.331 [5] and TS 23.287 [19], if multiple carrier frequencies are configured and if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2; and
\( 2> \) having a priority whose associated \( s l \)-threshCBR-FreqReselection is no lower than the CBR of the carrier when the carrier is (re-)selected in accordance with clause 5.22.1.11, if multiple carrier frequencies are configured if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2; and
\( 2> \) CAPC value of the SL data has an equal or smaller CAPC value than a CAPC value indicated in the COT sharing information if MAC decides to use the shared COT; and
\( 2>s \) l-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to the value that satisfies the following conditions:
3> if PSFCH is configured for the sidelink grant associated to the SCI and the UE is capable of PSFCH reception:
\( 4>s l \)-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to enabled, if sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to enabled for the highest priority logical channel satisfying the above conditions; or

4> sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled, if sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled for the highest priority logical channel satisfying the above conditions.

3> else:
4> sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled.
NOTE 2: HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator is set to disabled for the transmission of a MAC PDU only carrying CSI reporting MAC CE or Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE or Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE or Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE.
5.22.1.4.1.3 Allocation of sidelink resources

The MAC entity shall for each sidelink grant associated with Shared SL-PRS resource pool:
1> if there is SL-PRS pending for transmission for the selected destination:
\( 2> \) derive Transport Block Size for a new transmission for SL-SCH assuming SL-PRS can be transmitted in the sidelink grant according to clause 8.1.3.2 in TS 38.214 [7];

2 if all the SL-SCH data within logical channel with higher priority than that of the SL-PRS can be allocated with resources:
\( 3> \) determine that the pending SL-PRS can be transmitted in the sidelink grant.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) determine that the pending SL-PRRS cannot be transmitted in the sidelink grant;
3> derive the Transport Block Size for a new transmission for SL-SCH with no SL-PRS according to clause 8.1.3.2 in TS 38.214 [7].
