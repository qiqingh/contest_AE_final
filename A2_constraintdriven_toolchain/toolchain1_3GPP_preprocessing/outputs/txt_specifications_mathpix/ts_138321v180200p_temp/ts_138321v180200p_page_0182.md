PRS transmission(s) up to (and including) the last event that triggered a SL-PRS Resource Request (see clause 5.22.1.12) prior to the MAC PDU assembly.

All pending SR(s) triggered according to the SL-PRS Resource Request procedure (clause 5.22.1.12) shall be cancelled and each respective sr-ProhibitTimer shall be stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate the all the pending SLPRS transmission(s).
5.22.1.6 Buffer Status Reporting

The Sidelink Buffer Status reporting (SL-BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with information about SL data volume in the MAC entity.

RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-BSR:
- sl-periodicBSR-Timer, configured by periodicBSR-Timer in sl-BSR-Config;
- \( s l \)-retxBSR-Timer, configured by retxBSR-Timer in sl-BSR-Config;
- sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied;
- sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer, configured by logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer in sl-BSR-Config;
- sl-logicalChannelGroup.

Each logical channel which belongs to a Destination is allocated to an LCG as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The maximum number of LCGs is eight.

The MAC entity determines the amount of SL data available for a logical channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3] and 38.323 [4].

An SL-BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1:
\( 2> \) SL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG of a Destination, becomes available to the MAC entity; and either
\( 3> \) this SL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the priorities of the logical channels containing available SL data which belong to any LCG belonging to the same Destination; or

3> none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG belonging to the same Destination contains any available SL data.
in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Regular SL-BSR';
\( 2> \) UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits remaining after a Padding BSR has been triggered is equal to or larger than the size of the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Padding SL-BSR';
\( 2>s \) /-retxBSR-Timer expires, and at least one of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains SL data, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Regular SL-BSR';
\( 2>s \)-periodicBSR-Timer expires, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Periodic SL-BSR'.
\( 1> \) else:
\( 2> \) Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC and SL data is available for transmission in the RLC entity or in the PDCP entity, in which case the Sidelink BSR is referred below to as 'Regular SL-BSR'.

For Regular SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the SL-BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which \( s \)-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied with value true is configured by RRC:
\( 2> \) start or restart the sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer.
1> else:
