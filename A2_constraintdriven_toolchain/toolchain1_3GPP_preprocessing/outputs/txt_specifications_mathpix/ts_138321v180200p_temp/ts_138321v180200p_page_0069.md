3> if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in ra-ResponseWindow and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery:

4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
4 - if the uplink grant size does not match with size of the obtained MAC PDU; and
4> if the Random Access procedure was successfully completed upon receiving the uplink grant:
5> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include MAC subPDU(s) carrying MAC SDU from the obtained MAC PDU in the subsequent uplink transmission;
\( 5> \) obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity.
\( 3> \) else if this uplink grant is a configured grant configured with autonomous \( T x \); and
\( 3> \) if the previous configured uplink grant, in the BWP, for this HARQ process was not prioritized; and
\( 3> \) if a MAC PDU had already been obtained for this HARQ process; and
\( 3> \) if the uplink grant size matches with size of the obtained MAC PDU; and
\( 3> \) if none of PUSCH transmission(s) of the obtained MAC PDU has been completely performed:
4> consider the MAC PDU has been obtained.
3> else if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization; or
3> if this uplink grant is a prioritized uplink grant:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity, if any;
3> if a MAC PDU to transmit has been obtained:
\( 4> \) if the uplink grant is not a configured grant configured with autonomous \( T x \); or
4> if the uplink grant is a prioritized uplink grant:
\( 5> \) deliver the MAC PDU and the uplink grant and the HARQ information of the TB to the identified HARQ process;
\( 5> \) instruct the identified HARQ process to trigger a new transmission;
\( 5> \) if the uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
6> start or restart the configuredGrantTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers;
\( 6> \) start or restart the cg-RetransmissionTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.
\( 6> \) if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission for CG-SDT with CCCH message:
7> start or restart the cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed.
\( 6> \) if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission at RACH-less LTM cell switch; or
6> if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission of RACH-less handover:
7> start or restart the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer, if configured, for the corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed.
\( 5> \) if the uplink grant is addressed to C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant:
