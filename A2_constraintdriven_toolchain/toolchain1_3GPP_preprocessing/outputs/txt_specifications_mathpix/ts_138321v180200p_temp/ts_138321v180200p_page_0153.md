data available in the logical channel(s), and the remaining SL-PRS delay budget of the SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, allowed on the carrier by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources and that a retransmission resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [9].

4> use the randomly selected resource to select a set of periodic resources spaced by the resource reservation interval for transmissions of PSCCH, PSSCH, if available and SL-PRS, if available corresponding to the number of retransmission opportunities of the MAC PDUs determined in TS 38.214 [7] or SL-PRS(s);

4> consider the first set of transmission opportunities as the initial transmission opportunities and the other set(s) of transmission opportunities as the retransmission opportunities;
\( 4> \) consider the sets of initial transmission opportunities and retransmission opportunities as the selected sidelink grant.

3> else:
4> consider the set as the selected sidelink grant.
3> use the selected sidelink grant to determine the set of PSCCH durations and the set of PSSCH durations and the set of SL-PRS transmission occasion(s), if available, according to TS 38.214 [7] if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool or to determine the set of PSCCH durations and SLPRS transmission occasion(s) if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool according to TS 38.214 [7].

2> else if SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER \( =0 \) and when
SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER was equal to 1 the MAC entity randomly selected, with equal probability, a value in the interval \( [0,1] \) which is less than or equal to the probability configured by RRC in sl-ProbResourceKeep:
\( 3> \) clear the selected sidelink grant, if available;
3> randomly select, with equal probability, an integer value in the interval [5,15] for the resource reservation interval higher than or equal to 100 ms or in the interval \( \left[5 \times\left\lceil\frac{100}{\max \left(20, P_{\text {rsvp_tx }}\right)}\right\rceil, 15 \times\left\lceil\frac{100}{\max \left(20, P_{\text {rsvp_Tx }}\right)}\right\rceil\right] \) for the resource reservation interval lower than 100 ms and set
SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER to the selected value;
3> reuse the previously selected sidelink grant for the number of transmissions of the MAC PDUs or SLPRS(s) determined in TS 38.214 [7] with the resource reservation interval to determine the set of PSCCH durations, the set of PSSCH durations, and the pending SL-PRS transmission(s), if available, according to TS 38.214 [7].

1> if the MAC entity has selected to create a selected sidelink grant corresponding to transmission(s) of a single MAC PDU, and if SL data is available in a logical channel, or an SL-CSI reporting is triggered, or a Sidelink DRX Command indication is triggered or a Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information reporting is triggered, or a Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request is triggered; or

1> if the MAC entity has selected to create a selected sidelink grant corresponding to transmission of a single SLPRS, which has been triggered by the upper layer or by the reception of a SCI from a peer UE:
\( 2> \) if single carrier frequency is configured:
3> if SL data is available in the logical channel for NR sidelink discovery:
4> if sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon is configured according to TS 38.331 [5]:
\( 5> \) select the \( s l \)-DiscTxPoolSelected configured in sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig or sl-BWPDiscPoolConfigCommon for the transmission of NR sidelink discovery message.
