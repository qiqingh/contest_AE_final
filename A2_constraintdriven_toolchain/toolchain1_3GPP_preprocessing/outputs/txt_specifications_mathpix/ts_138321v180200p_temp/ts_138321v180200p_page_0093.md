3GPP TS 38.321 version 18.2.0 Release 18
92
ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)

A MAC PDU shall contain at most one DSR MAC CE. A MAC PDU shall not contain a DSR MAC CE if it includes all PDCP SDUs associated with all the pending DSRs.

After a DSR is triggered, it is considered as pending until it is cancelled. The MAC entity shall cancel a pending DSR, when all the PDCP SDUs associated with the DSR have been discarded, or when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this MAC PDU includes a DSR MAC CE that contains the delay information of all the PDCP SDUs associated with the DSR (as described in the clause 6.1_3.72), or when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this MAC PDU includes all the PDCP SDUs associated with the DSR.

NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation whether the MAC entity includes a DSR MAC CE in a MAC PDU if the MAC PDU can accommodate all PDCP SDUs associated with all the pending DSRs but is not sufficient to additionally accommodate the DSR MAC CE plus its subheader.
5.5 PCH reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive PCH , the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if a PCH assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the P -RNTI:
\( 2> \) attempt to decode the TB on the PCH as indicated by the PDCCH information;
\( 2> \) if the TB on the PCH has been successfully decoded:
\( 3> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
5.6 BCH reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive BCH, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) receive and attempt to decode the BCH ;
\( 1> \) if a TB on the BCH has been successfully decoded:
\( 2> \) deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
5.7 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality that controls the UE's PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, CI-RNTI, CS-RNTI, INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-SRS-RNTI, AI-RNTI, SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI and cellDTRX-RNTL. When using DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also monitor PDCCH according to requirements found in other clauses of this specification. When in RRC_CONNECTED, if DRX is configured, for all the activated Serving Cells, the MAC entity may monitor the PDCCH discontinuously using the DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity shall monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6].

NOTE 1: Void
RRC controls DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
- drx-onDurationTimer: the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
- drx-SlotOffset: the delay before starting the drx-onDurationTimer;
- drx-InactivityTimer: the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new UL, DL or SL transmission for the MAC entity;
- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast process): the maximum duration until a DL retransmission is received;
- drx-RetransmissionTimerUL (per UL HARQ process): the maximum duration until a grant for UL retransmission is received;
