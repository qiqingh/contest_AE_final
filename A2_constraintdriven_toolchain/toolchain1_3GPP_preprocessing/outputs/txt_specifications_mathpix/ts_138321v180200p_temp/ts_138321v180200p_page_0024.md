ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)
- messagePowerOffsetGroupB: the power offset for preamble selection included in groupBconfigured;
- numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA: defines the number of Random Access Preambles in Random Access Preamble group A for each SSB included in groupBconfigured.
- if Random Access Preambles group B is configured for 2-step RA type:
- msgA-DeltaPreamble: \( \Delta_{M s g} A_{-} P U S C H \) in TS 38.213 [6];
- messagePowerOffsetGroupB: the power offset for preamble selection included in GroupBConfiguredTwoStepRA;
- numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA: defines the number of Random Access Preambles in Random Access Preamble group A for each SSB included in GroupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA;
- ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA: the threshold to determine the groups of Random Access Preambles for 2-step RA type.
- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for SI request, if any;
- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for beam failure recovery request, if any;
- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for reconfiguration with sync, if any;
- ra-ResponseWindow: the time window to monitor RA response(s) (SpCell only);
- ra-ContentionResolutionTimer: the Contention Resolution Timer (SpCell only);
- msgB-ResponseWindow: the time window to monitor RA response(s) for 2-step RA type (SpCell only).

In addition, the following information for related Serving Cell is assumed to be available for UEs:
- if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:
- if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is configured with supplementary uplink as specified in TS 38.331 [5], and SUL carrier is selected for performing Random Access Procedure:
- \( \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CMAX}, \mathrm{J}, \mathrm{C}} \) of the SUL carrier as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16].
- else:
- P \( _{\text {CMAX, }, \mathrm{C}} \) of the NUL carrier as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16].

The following UE variables are used for the Random Access procedure:
- PREAMBLE_INDEX;
- PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER;
- PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_COUNTER;
- PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP;
- PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER;
- PREAMBLE_BACKOFF;
- PCMAX;
- SCALING_FACTOR_BI;
- TEMPORARY_C-RNTI;
- RA_TYPE;
- POWER_OFFSET_2STEP_RA;
- MSGA_PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP.
