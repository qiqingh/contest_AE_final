- RSWL: This field indicates resource selection window location, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Resource selection window location field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the field is 34 bits. If the length of Resource selection window location field in SCI format 2-C as specified in TS 38.212 [9] is shorter than 34 bit, this field contains Resource selection window location field using the LSB bits;
- Number of Subchannel: This field indicates the number of subchannels, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Number of subchannels field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. For Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE, the length of the field is 5 bits. If the length of Number of subchannels field in SCI format 2-C as specified in TS 38.212 [9] is shorter than 5 bit, this field contains Number of subchannels field using the LSB bits; for Enhanced Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE, the length of the field is 4 bits. If the length of Number of subchannel field in SCI format 2-C as specified in TS 38.212 [9] is shorter than 4 bits, this field contains Number of subchannel field using the LSB bits;
- Number of RB Set: This field is only included in the enhanced format. It indicates the number of RB sets, as the codepoint value of the SCI format 2-C Number of RB set field as specified in TS 38.212 [9]. The length of the field is 3 bits. If the length of Number of RB set field in SCI format 2-C as specified in TS 38.212 [9] is shorter than 3 bits, this field contains Number of RB set field using the LSB bits;
- R: Reserved bit, set to 0 .
