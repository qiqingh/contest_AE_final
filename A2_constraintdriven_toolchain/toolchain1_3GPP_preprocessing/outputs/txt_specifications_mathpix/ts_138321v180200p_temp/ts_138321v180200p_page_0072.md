1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the MSGA buffer; or
1> if there is no measurement gap at the time of the transmission and, in case of retransmission, the retransmission does not collide with a transmission for a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer or the MSGA buffer:
\( 2> \) if there are neither NR sidelink transmission nor transmission of V2X sidelink communication at the time of the transmission; or
\( 2> \) if the transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or can be simultaneously performed with sidelink transmission:

3> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the stored uplink grant.
If a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information, the HARQ process shall:
\( 1> \) stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer, if running;
1> if acknowledgement is indicated:
\( 2> \) stop the configuredGrantTimer, if running.
If the configuredGrantTimer expires for a HARQ process, the HARQ process shall:
\( 1> \) stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer, if running;
1> stop the cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer, if running.
\( 1> \) stop the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer, if running;
1> if a PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity's C-RNTI has not been received after initial transmission for the CGSDT with CCCH message to which the configuredGrantTimer corresponds:
\( 2> \) indicate failure to perform SDT procedure to the upper layer.
The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or can be performed simultaneously with sidelink transmission if one of the following conditions is met:
- if there are both a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmissionand configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and neither the NR sidelink transmission is prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1 a nor the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]; or
- if there are both a sidelink grant NR sidelink transmission and configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the NR sidelink transmission and/or the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication; or
- if there is only configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and either none of the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] or the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication; or
- if there is only a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission, and if the NR sidelink transmission is not prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a, or there is a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the NR sidelink transmission; or
- if there are both a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmission and configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and either only the of NR sidelink transmission is prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or only the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1-2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the prioritized NR sidelink transmission or the transmission of V2X sidelink communication:
