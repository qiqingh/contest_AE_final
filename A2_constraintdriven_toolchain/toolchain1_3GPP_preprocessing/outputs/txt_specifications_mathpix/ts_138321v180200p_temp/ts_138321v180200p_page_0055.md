1> when an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE is received and the Timing Advance Command is not set as FFF:
\( 2> \) apply the Timing Advance Command for the PTAG indicated by the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE;
\( 2> \) start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the PTAG indicated by LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE
\( 1> \) when an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE is received, and the Timing Advance Command is set as FFF, and the UE has successfully measured the Timing Advance as in clause 5.18.35:
\( 2> \) apply the measured Timing Advance for the PTAG;
\( 2> \) start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the PTAG.
\( 1> \) when a timeAlignmentTimer expires:
\( 2> \) if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a PTAG and the SpCell is not configured with two PTAGs; or
\( 2> \) if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a PTAG, the SpCell is configured with two PTAGs, and the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other PTAG is not running:

3> flush all HARQ buffers for all Serving Cells;
\( 3> \) notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells, if configured;
3> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells, if configured;
3> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants;
\( 3> \) clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
\( 3> \) consider all running timeAlignmentTimers as expired;
\( 3> \) maintain \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{TA}} \) (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of all TAGs.
\( 2> \) else:
3> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for an SCell configured with only this TAG; or
3> if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for an SCell, and if the SCell is configured with two TAGs and the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other TAG is not running:

4> flush all HARQ buffers for all such SCells;
\( 4> \) notify RRC to release PUCCH, if configured for all such SCells;
\( 4> \) notify RRC to release SRS, if configured for all such SCells;
\( 4> \) clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants for all such SCells;
\( 4> \) clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting for all such SCells;
\( 4> \) maintain \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{TA}} \) (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of this TAG.
3> else if the timeAlignmentTimer is associated with a TAG for a Serving Cell configured with two TAGs, and if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the other TAG is running, for all such Serving Cells:
\( 4> \) clear any configured downlink assignment, if the activated TCI state(s) for all PUCCH resources configured for the configured downlink assignment is associated with the TAG of the expired timeAlignmentTimer;
\( 4> \) clear any configured uplink grant, if the activated TCI state(s) for the configured uplink grant is associated with the TAG of the expired timeAlignmentTimer;

4> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting, if the activated TCI state(s) for the PUSCH resource is associated with the TAG of the expired timeAlignmentTimer;
