\( 2> \) if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or, in current symbol \( n \), if all multicast DRXes corresponding to the DRX group would not be in Active Time considering multicast assignments/DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions corresponding to the DRX group are configured with multicast DRX:

3> not transmit periodic SRS and semi-persistent SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7] in this DRX group;
3> not report CSI on PUCCH and semi-persistent CSI configured on PUSCH in this DRX group.
\( 2> \) if CSI masking ( \( c s i-M a s k \) ) is setup by upper layers:
\( 3> \) in current symbol n , if drx-onDurationTimer of a DRX group would not be running considering grants/assignments scheduled on Serving Cell(s) in this DRX group and DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in this clause; and

3> if allowCSI-SRS-Tx-MulticastDRX-Active is not configured, or if cfr-ConfigMulticast is not configured for any of the active BWP(s) of the Serving Cell(s), or, in current symbol n, if drxonDurationTimerPTM(s) of all multicast DRXes corresponding to the DRX group would not be running considering DRX Command MAC CE for MBS multicast received until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified in Clause 5.7b and all multicast sessions corresponding to the DRX group are configured with multicast DRX:
\( 4> \) not report CSI on PUCCH in this DRX group.
NOTE 4: If a UE multiplexes a CSI configured on PUCCH with other overlapping UCI(s) according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] clause 9.2.5 and this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s) would be reported on a PUCCH resource either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured or outside the on-duration period of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other \( \mathrm{UCl}(\mathrm{s}) \).

The MAC entity shall ensure no rounding error is generated when performing the modulus operation with \( d r x \) NonIntegerShortCycle or drx-NonIntegerLongCycle as the divisor.

Regardless of whether the MAC entity is monitoring PDCCH or not on the Serving Cells in a DRX group, the MAC entity transmits HARQ feedback, aperiodic CSI on PUSCH, and aperiodic SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7] on the Serving Cells in the DRX group when such is expected.

The MAC entity needs not to monitor the PDCCH if it is not a complete PDCCH occasion (e.g. the Active Time starts or ends in the middle of a PDCCH occasion).

When drx-LastTransmissionUL is configured, drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL or HARQ-RTT-TimerUL-NTN is started after the last PUSCH transmission occasion of a bundle regardless of whether that last PUSCH transmission occasion is used for a PUSCH transmission for that bundle or not.
5.7a Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for MBS Broadcast

For MBS broadcast, the MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality per G-RNTI that controls the UE's PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity's G-RNTI(s) as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. When in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED, if broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI discontinuously using the broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity monitors each PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause is performed independently for each G-RNTI and independently from the DRX operation specified in clauses 5.7 and 5.7b.

RRC controls broadcast DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
- drx-onDurationTimerPTM: the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
- drx-SlotOffsetPTM : the delay before starting the drx-onDurationTimerPTM;
