NOTE: If enableRA-PrioritizationForShicing is not configured in BWP-UplinkCommon and if both the provided NSAG-ID and the provided Access Identity whose corresponding bit in the ra-PrioritizationForAI is set to one are configured with ra-Prioritization either in RACH-ConfigCommon or RACHConfigCommonTwoStepRA, it is up to UE implementation how to determine the values of PREAMBLE_POWER_RAMPING_STEP and SCALING_FACTOR_BI.
5.1.1b Selection of the set of Random Access resources for the Random Access procedure

The MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is configured with both set(s) of Random Access resources with msg3-Repetitions set to true and set(s) of Random Access resources without msg3-Repetitions set to true and the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than rsrp-ThresholdMsg3; or
\( 1> \) if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is only configured with the set(s) of Random Access resources with msg3-Repetitions set to true:
\( 2> \) assume Msg 3 repetition is applicable for the current Random Access procedure.
\( 1> \) else:
\( 2> \) assume Msg3 repetition is not applicable for the current Random Access procedure.
\( 1> \) if contention-free Random Access Resources have been provided for this Random Access procedure in the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE and a non-zero Msgl repetition number is indicated in the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE:
\( 2> \) assume that Msgl repetition is applicable and that the Msgl repetition number applicable for the current Random Access procedure is the Msgl repetition number indicated in the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE.
