\( 2> \) when the MAC entity has an SR transmission occasion on the valid PUCCH resource for SR configured; and
\( 2> \) if sr-ProhibitTimer is not running at the time of the SR transmission occasion; and
\( 2> \) if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with a measurement gap:
3> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion overlaps with neither a UL-SCH resource whose simultaneous transmission with the SR is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCHGroups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePrioritySecondaryPUCCHgroup nor an SL-SCH resource; or

3> if the MAC entity is able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SLSCH resource; or

3> if the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary CRNTI or with the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4 .5 overlaps with any other UL-SCH resource(s), and the physical layer can signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant(s) for any UL-SCH resource(s) where the uplink grant was not already de-prioritized and its simultaneous transmission with the SR is not allowed by configuration of simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup or simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCHgroups or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePriority or simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SamePrioritySecondaryPUCCHgroup, and the priority of the uplink grant is determined as specified in clause 5.4.1; or

3> if both sl-PrioritizationThres and ul-PrioritizationThres are configured and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 overlaps with any UL-SCH resource(s) carrying a MAC PDU, and the value of the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is lower than sl-PrioritizationThres and the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU is higher than or equal to ul-PrioritizationThres and any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3 is not included in the MAC PDU and the MAC PDU is not prioritized by upper layer according to TS 23.287 [19]; or

3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and either transmission on the SL-SCH resource is not prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or the priority value of the logical channel that triggered SR is lower than \( u l \)-PrioritizationThres, if configured; or

3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is higher than the priority of the MAC PDU determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a for the SL-SCH resource; or

3> if an SL-PRS resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-PRS resource, and either transmission on the SL-PRS resource is not prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or the priority value of the logical channel that triggered SR is lower than \( u \)-PrioritizationThres, if configured; or

3> if an SL-PRS resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-PRS resource, and the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is higher than the priority of the MAC PDU and SL-PRS, if available, determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a for the SL-PRS resource:
\( 4> \) consider the SR transmission as a prioritized SR transmission.
\( 4> \) consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s), except for the overlapping uplink grant(s) whose simultaneous transmission is allowed by configuration of
