ETSI TS 138321 V18.2.0 (2024-08)
- ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex: defines PRACH occasions, on which preambles are allocated for a feature or a combination of features, associated with an SSB in which the MAC entity may transmit a Random Access Preamble (see clause 7.4);
- ra-OccasionList: defines PRACH occasion(s) associated with a CSI-RS in which the MAC entity may transmit a Random Access Preamble;
- ra-PreambleStartIndex: the starting index of Random Access Preamble(s) for on-demand SI request;
- startPreambleForThisPartition: the first preamble associated with the set of Random Access Resources applicable to the Random Access procedure;
- preambleTransMax: the maximum number of Random Access Preamble transmission;
- preambleTransMax-Msgl-Repettion: the maximum number of Random Access Preamble transmissions with a given Msgl repetition number before switching to Msgl repetition with the next available higher Msg1 repetition number;
- ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB: defines the number of SSBs mapped to each PRACH occasion for 4-step RA type and the number of contention-based Random Access Preambles mapped to each SSB;
- msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO: defines the number of contention-based Random Access Preambles for 2-step RA type mapped to each SSB when the PRACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step RA types;
- msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB: defines the number of SSBs mapped to each PRACH occasion for 2-step RA type and the number of contention-based Random Access Preambles mapped to each SSB;
- numberOfPreamblesPerSSB-ForThisPartition: defines the number of consecutive preambles for a feature or a combination of features mapped to each SSB;
- msgA-PUSCH-ResourceGroupA: defines MSGA PUSCH resources that the UE shall use when performing MSGA transmission using Random Access Preambles group A;
- msgA-PUSCH-ResourceGroupB: defines MSGA PUSCH resources that the UE shall use when performing MSGA transmission using Random Access Preambles group B;
- msgA-PUSCH-Resource-Index: identifies the index of the PUSCH resource used for MSGA in case of contention-free Random Access with 2 -step RA type;
- if groupBconfigured is configured, then Random Access Preambles group B is configured for 4-step RA type.
- Amongst the contention-based Random Access Preambles associated with an SSB (as defined in TS 38.213 [6]), the first numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA included in groupBconfigured Random Access Preambles belong to Random Access Preambles group A. The remaining Random Access Preambles associated with the SSB belong to Random Access Preambles group B (if configured).
- if groupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA is configured, then Random Access Preambles group B is configured for 2step RA type.
- Amongst the contention-based Random Access Preambles for 2-step RA type associated with an SSB (as defined in TS 38.213 [6]), the first numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA included in GroupBConfiguredTwoStepRA Random Access Preambles belong to Random Access Preambles group A. The remaining Random Access Preambles associated with the SSB belong to Random Access Preambles group B (if configured).

NOTE 3: If Random Access Preambles group B is supported by the cell Random Access Preambles group B is included for each SSB.
- if Random Access Preambles group B is configured for 4-step RA type:
- ra-Msg3SizeGroupA: the threshold to determine the groups of Random Access Preambles for 4-step RA type;
- msg3-DeltaPreamble: \( \Delta_{\text {preamble_Mgg }} \) in TS 38.213 [6];
