\( 2> \) if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure recovery request was transmitted on a nonterrestrial network:

3> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig at the PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 [6].
\( 2> \) else:
3> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig at the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 [6] from the end of the Random Access Preamble transmission.
\( 2> \) monitor for a PDCCH transmission on the search space indicated by recoverySearchSpaceld of the SpCell identified by the C-RNTI while ra-ResponseWindow is running.

1> else:
\( 2> \) if the Random Access Preamble was transmitted on a non-terrestrial network:
3> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted with repetitions:
4> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in RACH-ConfigCommon at the PDCCH occasion from the end of all repetitions of the Random Access Preamble transmission as specified in TS 38.213 [6].

3> else:
4> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in RACH-ConfigCommon at the PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 [6].
\( 2> \) else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted with repetitions:
3> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in RACH-ConfigCommon at the first PDCCH occasion from the end of all repetitions of the Random Access Preamble transmission as specified in TS 38.213 [6].
\( 2> \) else:
3> start the ra-ResponseWindow configured in RACH-ConfigCommon at the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 [6] from the end of the Random Access Preamble transmission.
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s) identified by the RA-RNTI while the raResponseWindow is running.
\( 1> \) if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission on the search space indicated by recoverySearchSpaceld is received from lower layers on the Serving Cell where the preamble was transmitted; and
\( 1> \) if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and
1> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:
\( 2> \) consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.
1> else if a valid (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]) downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the RARNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:
\( 2> \) if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff Indicator:
\( 3> \) set the PREAMBLE_BACKOFF to value of the BI field of the MAC subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with SCALING_FACTOR_BI.
\( 2> \) else:
3> set the PREAMBLE_BACKOFF to 0 ms .
\( 2> \) if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Random Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted PREAMBLE_INDEX (see clause 5.1.3):

3> consider this Random Access Response reception successful.
