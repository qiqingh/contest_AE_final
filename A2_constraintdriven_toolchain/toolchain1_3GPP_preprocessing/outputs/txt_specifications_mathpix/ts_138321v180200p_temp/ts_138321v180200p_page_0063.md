3> start or restart the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if configured;
3> stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;
3> stop the cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;
\( 3> \) stop the cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;
\( 3> \) deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity;
\( 3> \) if a logical channel associated with a DRB configured with survivalTimeStateSupport is multiplexed in the MAC PDU stored in the HARQ buffer for the corresponding HARQ process:
\( 4> \) trigger activation of PDCP duplication for all configured RLC entities of the DRB.
\( 2> \) else if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0 :
\( 3> \) if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 deactivation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation.
3> else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 activation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation;
4> store the uplink grant for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ information as configured uplink grant;

4 - initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant for this Serving Cell to start in the associated PUSCH duration and to recur according to rules in clause 5.8.2;

4> stop the configuredGrantTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;
4> stop the cg-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process, if running.
For each Serving Cell and each configured uplink grant, if configured and activated and available for use as specified in clause 5.8.2, the MAC entity shall:
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is configured with lch-basedPrioritization, and the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or
\( 1> \) if the MAC entity is not configured with lch-basedPrioritization, and the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or in a Random Access Response or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell:
\( 2> \) set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PUSCH duration;
\( 2> \) if, for the corresponding HARQ process, the configuredGrantTimer is not running and cgRetransmissionTimer is not configured and cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer is not configured, and cg-RRCRetransmissionTimer is not configured (i.e. new transmission):

3> if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission for the CG-SDT with CCCH message; or
3> if there is an ongoing CG-SDT procedure and PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity's C-RNTI has been received; or

3> if the configured uplink grant is for the first PUSCH transmission during an on-going LTM cell switch; or
3> if the configured uplink grant is for the first PUSCH transmission during an ongoing RACH-less handover procedure; or

3> if there is no ongoing CG-SDT nor ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch nor ongoing RACH-less handover procedure:
\( 4> \) consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been toggled;
