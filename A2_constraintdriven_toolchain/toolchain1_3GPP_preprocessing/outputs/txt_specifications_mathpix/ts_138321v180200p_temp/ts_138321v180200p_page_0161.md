3> else:
4> consider the set as the selected sidelink grant.
3> use the selected sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) and the SL-PRS transmission occasion(s), if available, according to TS 38.214 [7] if the selected resource pool is not Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool or to determine the PSCCH duration(s) and SL-PRS transmission occasion(s) if the selected resource pool is Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool according to TS 38.214 [7].

NOTE 3Ae: MAC entity, based on UE implementation, decides whether to indicate the number of consecutive slots for Multi-consecutive slots transmission as specified in clause 8.14 of TS 38.214 [7] larger than 1.

NOTE 3Af: MAC entity, based on UE implementation, decides the value of the number of consecutive slots for Multi-consecutive slots transmission if it decides the number of consecutive slots for Multi-consecutive slots transmission larger than 1 , as long as it meets the CAPC maximum COT duration requirement as specified in TS 37.213 [18].

NOTE 3 Ag : When the MAC entity selects the time and frequency resources from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7], it is up to the UE implementation whether to randomly select resources for transmission opportunities from the resources indicated by the physical layer or to select resources in consecutive slots by UE implementation from the resources indicated by the physical layer.

NOTE 3Ah: For a resource pool configured with PSFCH resource, UE cannot select consecutive slots for SL transmissions of a single TB for Multi-consecutive slots transmission.

NOTE 3Ai: UE may avoid selection of N consecutive resource(s) before a reserved resource of its own, where the selection of N is up to UE implementation from \( \{0,1,2\} \). UE may avoid selection of M consecutive resource(s) after a reserved resource of its own, where the selection of M is up to UE implementation (at least including 0 ).

NOTE 3Aj: If configured, UE may avoid selection of N consecutive resource(s) before a reserved resource of other UE when the L1 SL priority value for the transmission is higher than the L1 SL priority value of the reserved resource, where the selection of \( N \) is up to UE implementation from \( \{0,1,2\} \). UE may avoid selection of \( M \) consecutive resource(s) after a reserved resource of other UE when the transmitting symbols of the reserved resource overlap with LBT of its own selected resource, where the selection of M is up to UE implementation from \( \{0,1,2\} \). It is up to UE implementation how the physical layer reports detected reserved resources to MAC layer.

NOTE 3Ak: If configured, if transmission in slot(s) at least \( T_{p r o c, 0}^{S L} \) before a reserved resource of other UE is able to share its initiated COT to the reservation, UE may prioritize/select resource(s) in the slot(s) for transmission. It is up to UE implementation how the physical layer reports detected reserved resources to MAC layer.

NOTE 3AI: MAC entity, based on UE implementation, decides how to determine COT sharing cast type, COT sharing additional ID and remaining COT duration specified in TS 37.213 [18].

NOTE 3A1: If sl-InterUE-CoordinationSchemel enabling reception/transmission of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC and if multiple preferred resource sets are received from the same UE, it is up to UE implementation to use one or multiple of them in its resource (re)selection.

NOTE 3B1: If retransmission resource(s) cannot be selected by ensuring that the resource(s) can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI, how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources.

NOTE 3B2: When the UE receives both a single preferred resource set and a single non-preferred resource set from the same peer UE or different peer UEs, when the UE has own sensing results, it is up to the UE implementation to use the preferred resource set in its resource (re)selection for transmissions to the peer UE providing the preferred resource set.
