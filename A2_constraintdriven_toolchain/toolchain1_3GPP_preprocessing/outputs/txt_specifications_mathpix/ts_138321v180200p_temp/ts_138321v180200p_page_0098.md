\( 2> \) if DRX is (re-)configured by RRC:
\( 3> \) if dr \( x \)-TimeReferenceSFN is included in the RRC (re-)configuration which is received during the first half of a hyper frame (i.e., SFN is between 0 and 511):
\( 4> \) set DRX_SFN_COUNTER to 1 .
\( 3> \) else:
\( 4>\operatorname{set} D R X_{-} S F N_{-} \)COUNTER to 0 .
\( 1> \) if the Short DRX cycle is used for a DRX group and the drx-NonIntegerShortCycle is not configured, and [(SFN \( \times 10)+ \) subframe number] modulo \( ( \) drx-ShortCycle \( )=( \) drx-StartOffset \( ) \) modulo \( ( \) drx-ShortCycle \( ) \); or
\( 1> \) if the Short DRX cycle is used for a DRX group and the drx-NonIntegerShortCycle is configured, and floor \( [[( \) DRX_SFN_COUNTER \( \times 10240)+( \) SFN \( \times 10)+ \) subframe number - drx-StartOffset \( ] \) modulo \( ( \) drx NonIntegerShort(Cycle)) \( =0 \) :
\( 2> \) start drx-onDurationTimer for this DRX group after drx-SlotOffset from the beginning of the subframe.
\( 1> \) if the Long DRX cycle is used for a DRX group and the drx-NonIntegerLongCycleStartOffset is not configured, and \( [(\mathrm{SFN} \times 10)+ \) subframe number \( ] \) modulo \( ( \) drx-LongCycle \( )= \) drx-StartOffset; or
\( 1> \) if the Long DRX cycle is used for a DRX group and the dr \( x \)-NonIntegerLongCycleStartOffset is configured, and floor \( ([ \) DRX_SFN_COUNTER \( \times 10240)+( \) SFN \( \times 10)+ \) subframe number \( ] \) modulo (drx-NonIntegerLongCycle)) \( = \) drx-StartOffset:
\( 2> \) if DCP monitoring is configured for the active DL BWP as specified in TS 38.213 [6], clause 10.3:
\( 3> \) if DCP indication associated with the current DRX cycle received from lower layer indicated to start \( d r x \) onDurationTimer, as specified in TS 38.213 [6]; or
\( 3> \) if all DCP occasion(s) in time domain, as specified in TS 38.213 [6], associated with the current DRX cycle occurred in Active Time considering grants/assignments/DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and Scheduling Request sent until 4 ms prior to start of the last DCP occasion, or during a measurement gap, or when the MAC entity monitors for a PDCCH transmission on the search space indicated by recoverySearchSpaceld of the SpCell identified by the C-RNTI while the ra-ResponseWindow is running (as specified in clause 5.1.4); or
\( 3> \) if \( p s \)-Wakeup is configured with value true and DCP indication associated with the current DRX cycle has not been received from lower layers:
\( 4> \) start drx-onDurationTimer after drx-SlotOffset from the beginning of the subframe.
\( 2> \) else:
\( 3> \) start drx-onDurationTimer for this DRX group after drx-SlotOffset from the beginning of the subframe.
NOTE 2: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the SpCell is used to calculate the DRX duration.
\( 1> \) if a DRX group is in Active Time:
\( 2> \) monitor the PDCCH on the Serving Cells in this DRX group as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH indicates a DL transmission; or
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH indicates a one-shot HARQ feedback as specified in clause 9.1.4 of TS 38.213[6]; or
\( 2> \) if the PDCCH indicates a retransmission of HARQ feedback as specified in clause 9.1.5 of TS 38.213 [6]:
