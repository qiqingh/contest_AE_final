- When subbandAmplitude is set to 'false',
- \( \quad k_{l, i}^{(2)}=1 \) for \( l=1, \ldots, v \), and \( i=0,1, \ldots, 2 L-1 . i_{2,2, l} \) is not reported for \( l=1, \ldots, v \).
- For \( l=1, \ldots, v \), the elements of \( i_{2,1, l} \) corresponding to the coefficients that satisfy \( k_{l, i}^{(1)}>0, i \neq i_{1,3, l} \), as determined by the reported elements of \( i_{1,4, l} \), are reported, where \( c_{l, i} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, N_{\text {PSK }}-1\right\} \) and the remaining \( 2 L-M_{1} \) elements of \( i_{2,1, i} \) are not reported and are set to \( c_{l, i}=0 \).
- When subbandAmplitude is set to 'true',
- For \( l=1, \ldots, v \), the elements of \( i_{2,2, l} \) and \( i_{2,1, l} \) corresponding to the \( \min \left(M_{l}, K^{(2)}\right)-1 \) strongest coefficients (excluding the strongest coefficient indicated by \( i_{1,3,1} \) ), as determined by the corresponding reported elements of \( i_{1,4, l} \), are reported, where \( k_{l, i}^{(2)} \in\{0,1\} \) and \( c_{l, i} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, N_{\text {PSK }}-1\right\} \). The values of \( K^{(2)} \) are given in Table 5.2.2.2.3-4. The remaining \( 2 L-\min \left(M_{l}, K^{(2)}\right) \) elements of \( i_{2,2, l} \) are not reported and are set to \( k_{l, i}^{(2)}=1 \). The elements of \( i_{2,1,1} \) corresponding to the \( M_{i}-\min \left(M_{i}, K^{(2)}\right) \) weakest non-zero coefficients are reported, where \( c_{, i} \in\{0,1,2,3\} \). The remaining \( 2 L-M_{i} \) elements of \( i_{2,1, r} \) are not reported and are set to \( c_{r, i}=0 \).
- When two elements, \( k_{, x}^{(1)} \) and \( k_{, y}^{(1)} \), of the reported elements of \( i_{1,4,} \) are identical \( \left(k_{l, x}^{(1)}=k_{l, y}^{(1)}\right) \), then element \( \min (x, y) \) is prioritized to be included in the set of the \( \min \left(M_{l}, K^{(2)}\right)-1 \) strongest coefficients for \( i_{2,1, l} \) and \( i_{2,2, l}(l=1, \ldots, v) \) reporting.
