AggregationFactor (if numberOfRepetitions is not present in the time domain resource allocation table), and transmission of CSI report(s) is determined as follows
- if higher layer paremeter AP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is enabled and UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is transmitted separately on the first transmission occasion and the second transmission occasion
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is transmitted only on the first transmission occasion.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint "10" or "11" for the SRS resource set indicator and schedules aperiodic CSI report(s) or activates semi-persistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH with no transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the number of nominal repetitions is always assumed to be 2 regardless of the value of numberOfRepetitions, and the first and second nominal repetitions are expected to be the same as the first and second actual repetitions, and transmission of CSI report(s) is determined as follows:
- if higher layer paremeter AP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is enabled for aperiodic CSI report(s) or higher layer paremeter SP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCHTriggerStateList is enabled for semi-persistent CSI report(s) and UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is transmitted separately on the first actual repetition and the second actual repetition
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is transmitted only on the first actual repetition.

For PUSCH repetition Type A, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint "10" or "11" for the SRS resource set indicator and activates semi-persistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH with no transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the number of repetitions is always assumed to be 2 regardless of the value of numberOfRepetitions or pusch-AggregationFactor (if numberOfRepetitions is not present in the time domain resource allocation table), and transmission of CSI report(s) is determined as follows
- if higher layer paremeter SP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-SemiPersistenetOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList is enabled and UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is transmitted separately on the first transmission occasion and the second transmission occasion
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is transmitted only on the first transmission occasion.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 10 " or " 11 " for the SRS resource set indicator and the PUSCH repetition Type B carrying semi-persistent CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH after being activated on PUSCH by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the number of nominal repetitions is always assumed to be 2 regardless of the value of numberOfRepetitions, and transmission of CSI report(s) is determined as follows
- if higher layer paremeter SP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-SemiPersistenetOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList is enabled and one of the first or second nominal repetition is the same as corresponding first or second actual repetition, the nominal repetition that is not having same actual repetition is omitted and the CSI report(s) is transmitted on the actual repetition that is not omitted.
- if higher layer paremeter SP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-SemiPersistenetOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList is enabled and the first and second nominal repetitions are the same as the first and second actual repetitions and the UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is transmitted separately on the first actual repetition and the second actual repetition
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is transmitted only on the first actual repetition.
6.1.2.1.1 Determination of the resource allocation table to be used for PUSCH

Table 6.1.2.1.1-1, Table 6.1.2.1.1-1A and Table 6.1.2.1.1-1B define which PUSCH time domain resource allocation configuration to apply.

Table 6.1 2.1.1-4 defines the subcarrier spacing specific values \( j . j \) is used in determination of \( K_{2} \) in conjunction to table 6.1.2.1.1-2, for normal CP or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 for extended CP, where \( \mu_{P U S C H} \) is the subcarrier spacing configurations for PUSCH.
