ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

UE shall not expect to receive DM-RS in resource elements that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE can expect that the same or different subcarrier spacing is configured for the DM-RS and SS/PBCH block in a CC except for the case of 240 kHz where only different subcarrier spacing is supported.

If at least one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states and the UE receives the DM-RS for PDSCH and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable.

If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in different ControlResourceSets, and the UE receives the DM-RS for \( \mathrm{PDSCH}(\mathrm{s}) \) and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH(s) and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'QCL-TypeD', if 'QCL-TypeD' is applicable.

If a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may be scheduled with fully or partially overlapping PDSCHs in the time and frequency domain by multiple PDCCHs with the following restrictions,
- the UE is not expected to assume different DM-RS configuration with respect to the actual number of frontloaded DM-RS symbol(s), the actual number of additional DM-RS symbol(s), the actual DM-RS symbol location, and DM-RS configuration type.
- the UE is not expected to assume DM-RS ports in a CDM group indicated by two TCI states.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation, the UE is not configured with sfnSchemePdsch and it is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DMRS port(s) within two CDM groups in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)',
- the first TCI state corresponds to the CDM group of the first antenna port indicated by the antenna port indication table, and the second TCI state corresponds to the other CDM group.

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter [dmrs-FD-OCC-disableForRanklPDSCH] and the UE is scheduled with PDSCH with single DM-RS port, the UE may assume that set of orthogonal DM-RS antenna ports from the same CDM group using different set of \( w\left(k^{\prime}\right) \) codes are not associated with the transmission of PDSCH to another UE.
5.1.6.3 PT-RS reception procedure

The procedures on PT-RS reception described in this clause apply to a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _ 2 configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-12 or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-1-2 and to a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1.0 or DCI format 1_1 configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCHMappingTypeA or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB. The procedures on PT-RS reception described in this clause apply to a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) or \( 4 \_2 \) configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB in PDSCH-Config-Multicast.

A UE shall report the preferred MCS and bandwidth thresholds based on the UE capability at a given carrier frequency, for each subcarrier spacing applicable to data channel at this carrier frequency, assuming the MCS table with the maximum Modulation Order as it reported to support.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in DMRS-DownlinkConfig,
- the higher layer parameters timeDensity and frequencyDensity in PTRS-DownlinkConfig indicate the threshold values ptrs-MCSi, \( i=1,2,3 \) and \( N_{R B, i}, i=0,1 \), as shown in Table 5-1.6-3-1 and Table 5-1.6-3-2, respectively.
- if either or both of the additional higher layer parameters timeDensity and frequencyDensity are configured, and the RNTI equals MCS-C-RNTI, C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, the UE shall assume the PT-RS antenna port' presence and pattern is a function of the corresponding scheduled MCS of the corresponding codeword and scheduled band width in corresponding bandwidth part as shown in Table 5.1.6.3-1 and Table 5.1.6.3-2,
- if the higher layer parameter timeDensity given by PTRS-DownlinkConfig is not configured, the UE shall assume \( L_{P T-R S}=1 \).
- if the higher layer parameter frequencyDensity given by PTRS-DownlinkConfig is not configured, the UE shall assume \( K_{P T-R S}=2 \).
