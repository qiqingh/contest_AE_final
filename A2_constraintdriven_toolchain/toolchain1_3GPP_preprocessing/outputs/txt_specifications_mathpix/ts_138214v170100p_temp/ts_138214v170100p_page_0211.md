- the UE is a destination UE of a TB associated with the received [SCI format 1-A] and the RSRP measurement performed, according to clause 8.4.2.1 for the received [ SCI format 1-A], is lower than \( T h^{\prime}\left(\right. \) pri \( \left.o_{R X}\right) \) where pri \( o_{R X} \) is the value of the priority field in the received [ SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) ]. The internal parameter \( T h^{\prime}\left(p_{i}\right) \) is set to the corresponding value of RSRP threshold indicated by the \( k \)-th field in thresholdRSRPCondition IB IOption 2Schemel, where \( k=p_{i} \).
- resources(s) in slot(s) in which the UE does not expect to perform SL reception due to half duplex operation, if the UE is a destination UE of a TB for whose transmission the non-preferred resource set is being determined.
8.1.4B UE procedure for determining a resource conflict

A UE configured with the higher layer parameter interUECoordinationScheme 2 enabling transmission of a resource conflict indication considers that a resource conflict occurs on a first reserved resource \( r_{1} \) indicated by a first received SCI format if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
- the first reserved resource \( r_{1} \) overlaps with a second reserved resource \( r_{2} \) indicated by a second received SCI format, and
- if [the higher layer parameter for enabling Options \( 1 / 4 \) in Condition 2-A-1] indicates [Option 1 enabled],
- if the UE is a destination UE of a TB to be transmitted in \( r_{1} \), the RSRP measurement performed for the second received SCI format \( R S R P_{2} \) is higher than \( T h\left(\right. \) prio \( o_{2} \), prio \( \left.o_{1}\right) \) where prio \( o_{1} \) and prio \( o_{2} \) are the priorities indicated in the first and second received SCI format, respectively.
- if the UE is a destination UE of a TB to be transmitted in \( r_{2} \), the RSRP measurement performed for the first received \( S C I \) format \( R S R P_{1} \) is higher than \( T h\left(\right. \) prio \( o_{1} \), prio \( o_{2} \) ) where prio \( o_{1} \) and prio \( o_{2} \) are the priorities indicated in the first and second received SCI format, respectively.
- if [the higher layer parameter for enabling Options \( 1 / 4 \) in Condition 2-A-1] indicates [Option 4 enabled] and the UE supports [Option 4],
- if the UE is a destination UE of a TB to be transmitted in \( r_{1}, R S R P_{2}-R S R P_{1} \) is higher than a (pre)configured RSRP threshold.
- if the UE is a destination UE of a TB to be transmitted in \( r_{2}, R S R P_{1}-R S R P_{2} \) is higher than a (pre)configured RSRP threshold.
- where the \( R S R P_{1}, R S R P_{2} \) measurements are performed according to clause 8.4.2.1 and the parameter \( T h\left(p_{i}, p_{j}\right) \) is determined [as described in step 3 of clause 8.1.4].
- the first reserved resource \( r_{1} \) occurs in a slot in which the UE does not expect to perform SL reception due to half-duplex operation and the UE is a destination UE of a TB to be transmitted in resource \( r_{1} \).
8.1.4C UE procedure for using a received non-preferred resource set

A UE configured with the higher layer parameter interUECoordinationSchemel uses a received non-preferred resource set as follows when performing resource (re-)selection:
- the UE excludes in Step 6b) of clause 8.1.4 resource(s) overlapping with the non-preferred resource set.

Note: If it is not possible to meet the requirement that the number of candidate single-slot resources remaining in the set \( S_{A} \) be at least \( X \cdot M_{\text {total }} \) after excluding resource(s) overlapping with the received non-preferred resource set, it is up to UE implementation whether or not to take into account the received non-preferred resource set to meet such requirement.
8.1.5 UE procedure for determining slots and resource blocks for PSSCH transmission associated with an SCI format 1-A

The set of slots and resource blocks for PSSCH transmission is determined by the resource used for the PSCCH transmission containing the associated SCI format 1-A, and fields 'Frequency resource assignment', 'Time resource assignment' of the associated SCI format 1-A as described below.
