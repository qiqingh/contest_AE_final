A downlink type 1 resource block assignment field in the DCI format \( 4 \_0 \) or DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) consists of a RIV corresponding to a starting resource block in reference to the lowest RB of the CFR \( R B_{\text {start }}=0, K, 2 \cdot K, \ldots,\left(N_{B W P}^{\text {initial }}-1\right) \cdot K \) and a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource blocks \( \mathrm{L}_{R B s} \), where \( N_{B W P}^{\text {initial }} \) is given by
- the size of CORESET 0 if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell;
- the size of initial DL band width part if CORESET 0 is not configured for the cell.

The resource indication value is defined by:
if \( \left(L_{\text {RBS }}^{\prime}-1\right) \leq\left\lfloor N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {inididal }} / 2\right\rfloor \) then
\[
R I V=N_{B W P}^{\text {intial }}\left(L_{\text {isss }}^{\prime}-1\right)+R B_{\text {start }}^{\prime}
\]
else
\[
R I V=N_{s W P}^{\text {initial }}\left(N_{s W P}^{\text {initial }}-L_{\text {ness }}^{\prime}+1\right)+\left(N_{s W P}^{\text {initial }}-1-R B_{\text {start }}^{\prime}\right)
\]
where \( L_{R B s}^{\prime}=L_{R B s} / K, R B_{\text {siars }}^{\prime}=R B_{\text {siars }} / K \) and where \( L_{R B s}^{\prime} \) shall not exceed \( N_{s W P}^{\text {initial }}-R B_{\text {start }}^{\prime} \) -
If \( N_{C F R}>N_{B W P}^{\text {initial }}, K \) is the maximum value from set \( \{1,2,4,6,8,10,12\} \) which satisfies \( \mathrm{K} \leq\left\lfloor N_{C F R} / N_{B W P}^{\text {initial }}\right\rfloor \); otherwise \( K=1 \).

In downlink resource allocation of type 1 scheduled using DCI format 42 with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CSRNTI, the description in clause 5.1.2.2.2 with the following changes: \( R \bar{B}_{\text {sart }} \) corresponds to a starting resource block in reference to the lowest RB of the CFR and \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}}^{\text {size }} \) is the size of the CFR.
5.1.2.3 Physical resource block (PRB) bundling

The PRB bundling procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of prb-BundlingTypeDCI-1-2 instead of prb-BundingType as well as vrb-ToPRB-InterleaverDCI-1-2 instead of vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver. The PRB bundling procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4_2, by applying the parameters of prb-BundlingType given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast as well as vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast.

A UE may assume that precoding granularity is \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) consecutive resource blocks in the frequency domain. \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) can be equal to one of the values among \( \{2,4 \), wideband \( \} \).

If \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) is determined as "wideband", the UE is not expected to be scheduled with non-contiguous PRBs and the UE may assume that the same precoding is applied to the allocated resource associated with a same TCI state or a same QCL assumption.

If \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) is determined as one of the values among \( \{2,4\} \), Precoding Resource Block Group (PRGs) partitions the band width part \( i \) with \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) consecutive PRBs. Actual number of consecutive PRBs in each PRG could be one or more.

The first PRG size is given by \( P_{S W P, 1}^{\prime}-N_{B W P, 1}^{s \operatorname{sars}} \bmod P_{S W P, 1}^{\prime} \) and the last PRG size given by \( \left(N_{B W P, i}^{s t a r t}+N_{B W P, i}^{s i z e}\right) \bmod P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) if \( \left(N_{B W P, i}^{s t a r t}+N_{B W P, i}^{s i z e}\right) \bmod P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \neq 0 \), and the last PRG size is \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) if \( \left(N_{B W P, i}^{s t a r t}+N_{B W P, i}^{s i z e}\right) \bmod P_{B W P, i}^{\prime}=0 \). For PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI scrambled using G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, \( N_{B W P, i}^{s t a r t} \) is the starting PRB of the CFR and \( N_{B W P, i}^{\text {size }} \) is the CFR.

The UE may assume the same precoding is applied for any downlink contiguous allocation of PRBs in a PRG.
For PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise, a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0 .
