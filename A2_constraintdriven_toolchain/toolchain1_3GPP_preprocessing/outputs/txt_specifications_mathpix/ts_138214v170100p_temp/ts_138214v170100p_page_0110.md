\begin{array}{c}
k_{l, f}^{(3)}=\left[k_{l, 0, f}^{(3)} \ldots k_{l, 2 L-1, f}^{(3)}\right] \\

for \( l=1, \ldots, v \), such that \( K_{l}^{N Z}=\sum_{i=0}^{2 L-1} \sum_{f=0}^{M_{v}-1} k_{l, i, f}^{(3)} \leq K_{0} \) is the number of nonzero coefficients for layer \( l=1, \ldots, v \) and \( K^{N Z}=\sum_{l=1}^{v} K_{l}^{N Z} \leq 2 K_{0} \) is the total number of nonzero coefficients.

The indices of \( i_{2,4, l}, i_{2,5, l} \) and \( i_{1,7, l} \) are associated to the \( M_{v} \) codebook indices in \( n_{3, l} \) -
The mapping from \( k_{l, p}^{(1)} \) to the amplitude coefficient \( p_{l, p}^{(1)} \) is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-2 and the mapping from \( k_{l, i, f}^{(2)} \) to the amplitude coefficient \( p_{l, i, f}^{(2)} \) is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-3. The amplitude coefficients are represented by
\[
\begin{aligned}
p_{l}^{(1)} & =\left[\begin{array}{ll}
p_{l, 0}^{(1)} & p_{l, 1}^{(1)}
\end{array}\right] \\
p_{l}^{(2)} & =\left[p_{l, 0}^{(2)} \ldots p_{l, M_{v}-1}^{(2)}\right] \\
p_{l, f}^{(2)} & =\left[p_{l, 0, f}^{(2)} \ldots p_{l, 2 L-1, f}^{(2)}\right]
\end{aligned}
\]
for \( l=1, \ldots, v \).
Let \( f_{l}^{*} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, M_{v}-1\right\} \) be the index of \( i_{2,4, l} \) and \( i_{l}^{*} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 2 L-1\} \) be the index of \( k_{l, f_{l}^{*}}^{(2)} \) which identify the strongest coefficient of layer \( l \), i.e., the element \( k_{l, l_{l}^{*}, f_{l}^{*}}^{(2)} \) of \( i_{2,4, l} \), for \( l=1, \ldots, v \). The codebook indices of \( n_{3, l} \) are remapped with respect to \( n_{3, l}^{\left(f_{l}^{*}\right)} \) as \( n_{3, l}^{(f)}=\left(n_{3, l}^{(f)}-n_{3, l}^{\left(f_{l}^{*}\right)}\right) \bmod N_{3} \), such that \( n_{3, l}^{\left(f_{l}^{*}\right)}=0 \), after remapping. The index \( f \) is remapped with respect to \( f_{l}^{*} \) as \( f=\left(f-f_{l}^{*}\right) \bmod M_{v} \), such that the index of the strongest coefficient is \( f_{l}^{*}=0 \) ( \( l= 1, \ldots, v \) ), after remapping. The indices of \( i_{2,4, l}, i_{2,5, l} \) and \( i_{1,7, l} \) indicate amplitude coefficients, phase coefficients and bitmap after remapping.

The strongest coefficient of layer \( l \) is identified by \( i_{1,8, l} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 2 L-1\} \), which is obtained as follows
\[
i_{1,8, l}=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\sum_{i=0}^{i_{1}^{*}} k_{1, i_{0}}^{(3)}-1 & v=1 \\
i_{l}^{*} & 1<v \leq 4
\end{array}\right.
\]
for \( l=1, \ldots, v \).

The amplitude and phase coefficient indicators are reported as follows:
