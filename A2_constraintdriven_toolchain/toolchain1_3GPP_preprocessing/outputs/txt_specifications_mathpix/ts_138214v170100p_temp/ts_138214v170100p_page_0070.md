- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource setting is given by resourcesForChannelMeasurement for L1-RSRP measurement. In such a case, the number of configured CSI Resource Sets in the Resource Setting is \( \mathrm{S}=2 \)

For aperiodic CSI, and for aperiodic CSI resource settings, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with resourcesForChannel and resourcesForChannel2, which correspond to first and second resource sets, respectively, for L1-RSRP measurement.

For semi-persistent or periodic CSI, each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s):
- When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, the Resource Setting is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation.
- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M. For L1-SINR computation, the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter csi-IMResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference) is used for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.

A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource in resource set for channel measurement for a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'. A UE is not expected to be configured with more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in resource setting for channel measurement for a CSIReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[M resources.

An NZP CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement with \( 2 \leq K_{s} \leq 8 \) resources can be configured with two Resource Groups, with \( K_{1} \geq 1 \) resources in Group 1 and \( K_{2} \geq 1 \) resources in Group 2, such that \( K_{1}+K_{2}=K_{s} \), and with \( N \in\{1,2\} \) Resource Pairs. Each Resource Pair consists of one resource from Group 1 and one resource from Group 2. The same resource can be associated with two Resource Pairs in frequency range 1 but not in frequency range 2.

Except for L1-SINR, if interference measurement is performed on NZP CSI-RS, a UE does not expect to be configured with more than one NZP CSI-RS resource in the associated resource set within the resource setting for channel measurement. Except for L1-SINR, the UE configured with the higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RSResourcesForInterference may expect no more than 18 NZP CSI-RS ports configured in a NZP CSI-RS resource set.

For CSI measurement(s) other than L1-SINR, a UE assumes:
- each NZP CSI-RS port configured for interference measurement corresponds to an interference transmission layer.
- all interference transmission layers on NZP CSI-RS ports for interference measurement take into account the associated EPRE ratios configured in 5.2.2.3.1;
- other interference signal on REs of NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement, or CSI-IM resource for interference measurement.

For L1-SINR measurement with dedicated interference measurement resources, a UE assumes:
- the total received power on dedicated NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement or dedicated CSI-IM resource for interference measurement corresponds to interference and noise.
5.2.1.4.2 Report Quantity Configurations

A UE may be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to either 'none', 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI ', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-SINR',
