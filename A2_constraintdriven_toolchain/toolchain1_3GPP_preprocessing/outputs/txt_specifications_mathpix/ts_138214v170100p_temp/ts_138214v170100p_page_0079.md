the QCL assumptions in the indicated TCI states for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in the CSI triggering state indicated by the CSI trigger field in DCI.
- The UE is not expected to receive aperiodic CSI-RS and PDSCH/aperiodic CSI-RS associated with different values of coresetPoollndex in overlapped symbol(s). The UE is not expected to receive aperiodic CSI-RS and semi-persistent/periodic CSI-RS with different 'QCL-type D' in overlapped symbol(s).
- If configured, the UE may assume that a CSI-RS resource in an aperiodic CSI-RS resource set configured without trs-Info is quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the indicated TCI state.
- A non-zero codepoint of the CSI request field in the DCI is mapped to a CSI triggering state according to the order of the associated positions of the up to \( 2^{N} T S-1 \) trigger states in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList with codepoint ' 1 ' mapped to the triggering state in the first position.

For a UE configured with the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList, if a Resource Setting linked to a CSI-ReportConfig has multiple aperiodic resource sets, only one of the aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets from the Resource Setting is associated with the trigger state, and the UE is higher layer configured per trigger state per Resource Setting to select the one CSI-[M/NZP CSI-RS resource set from the Resource Setting.

When aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic reporting, the CSI-RS offset is configured per resource set by the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset or aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16. The CSI-RS triggering offset has the values of \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6, \ldots, 15,16,24\} \) slots. If the UE is not configured with minimumScheduling OffsetKO for any DL BWP and minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 for any UL BWP and if all the associated trigger states do not have the higher layer parameter qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in the corresponding TCI states, the CSI-RS triggering offset is fixed to zero. The aperiodic triggering offset of the CSI-[M follows offset of the associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement. The aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted in a slot \( K_{s}, K_{s}=n+X+\left(\frac{N_{\text {slot, offset, } \text { PDCCH }}^{\text {CA }}}{2^{\mu_{\text {Offset, } \text { PDCCH }}}}-\frac{N_{\text {slot, } \text { offset, } \text { CSIRS }}^{\text {CA }}}{2^{\mu_{\text {Offset, } \text { CSIRS }}}}\right) \). \( 2^{\mu \operatorname{CSIRS}} \), if UE is configured with ca-SlotOffset for at least one of the triggered and triggering cell, and in slot \( K_{s}=n+X \), otherwise, and where
- \( n \) is the slot containing the triggering DCI, \( X \) is the CSI-RS triggering offset according to the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset or aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16,
- \( \quad N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offsel }} \) which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \( N_{\text {slot, offset, CSIRS }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, CSIRS }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offsel }} \) which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the CSI-RS respectively, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5.

The UE does not expect that aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted before the OFDM symbol(s) carrying its triggering DCI. When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied, UE is not expected to be triggered by CSI triggering state indicated by the CSI request field in DCI in which CSI-RS triggering offset is smaller than the currently applicable minimum scheduling offset restriction \( K_{0 \text { mn- }} \)

If interference measurement is performed on aperiodic NZP CSI-RS, a UE is not expected to be configured with a different aperiodic triggering offset of the NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement from the associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement.

If the UE is configured with a single carrier for uplink, the UE is not expected to transmit more than one aperiodic CSI report triggered by different DCIs on overlapping OFDM symbols.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used, and the UE does not expect that the aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted before the first symbol of the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time.
5.2.1.5.1a Aperiodic CSI Reporting/Aperiodic CSI-RS when the triggering PDCCH and the CSI-RS have different numerologies

When the triggering PDCCH and the triggered aperiodic CSI-RS are of different numerologies, the behavior defined in 5.2.1.5.1 for the case where the numerologies are the same applies with the following exceptions:
