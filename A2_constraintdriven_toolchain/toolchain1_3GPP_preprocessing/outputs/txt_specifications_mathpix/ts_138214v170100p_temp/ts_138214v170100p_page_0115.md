- The value of \( R \) is configured as in Clause 5.2.2.2.5.

The UE is also configured with the higher layer bitmap parameter typell-PortSelectionRI-Restriction-r16, which forms the bit sequence \( r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{0} \), where \( r_{0} \) is the LSB and \( r_{3} \) is the MSB. When \( r_{i} \) is zero, \( i \in\{0,1, \ldots, 3\}, \mathrm{PMI} \) and RI reporting are not allowed to correspond to any precoder associated with \( v=i+1 \) layers.

The PMI value corresponds to the codebook indices \( i_{1} \) and \( i_{2} \) where

The \( 2 L \) antenna ports are selected by the index \( i_{1,1} \) as in clause 5.2.2.2.4.
Parameters \( N_{3}, M_{v}, M_{\text {initial }} \) (for \( N_{3}>19 \) ) and \( K_{0} \) are defined as in clause 5.2.2.2.5.
For layer \( l, l=1, \ldots, v \), the strongest coefficient \( i_{1,8, l} \), the amplitude coefficient indicators \( i_{2,3, l} \) and \( i_{2,4, l} \), the phase coefficient indicator \( i_{2,5 l} \) and the bitmap indicator \( i_{1,7 l} \) are defined and indicated as in clause 5.2.2.2.5, where the mapping from \( k_{l, p}^{(1)} \) to the amplitude coefficient \( p_{l, p}^{(1)} \) is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-2 and the mapping from \( k_{l, i, f}^{(2)} \) to the amplitude coefficient \( p_{l, i, f}^{(2)} \) is given inTable 5.2.2.2.5-3.

The number of nonzero coefficients for layer \( l, K_{l}{ }^{N Z} \), and the total number of nonzero coefficients \( K^{N Z} \) are defined as in Clause 5.2.2.2.5.

The amplitude coefficients \( p_{l}^{(1)} \) and \( p_{l}^{(2)}(l=1, \ldots, v) \) are represented as in clause 5.2.2.2.5.
The amplitude and phase coefficient indicators are reported as in clause 5.2.2.2.5.
Codebook indicators \( i_{1,5} \) and \( i_{1,6, l}(l=1, \ldots, v) \) are found as in clause 5.2.2.2.5.
The codebooks for 1-4 layers are given in Table 5.2.2.2.6-2, where \( v_{m} \) is a \( P_{C S I-R S} / 2 \)-element column vector containing a value of 1 in element ( \( m \bmod P_{C S I-R S} / 2 \) ) and zeros elsewhere (where the first element is element 0 ), and the quantities \( \varphi_{l, i, f} \) and \( y_{t, l} \) are defined as in clause 5.2.2.2.5.
