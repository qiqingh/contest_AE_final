ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

requested CSI reports with lowest priority (according to Clause 5.2 .5 ), where \( 0 \leq M \leq N \) is the largest value such that \( \sum_{n=0}^{M-1} O_{C P U}^{(n)} \leq N_{C P U}-L \) holds.

A UE is not expected to be configured with an aperiodic CSI trigger state containing more than \( N_{C P U} \) Reporting Settings. Processing of a CSI report occupies a number of CPUs for a number of symbols as follows:
- \( O_{C P U}=0 \) for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none' and CSI-RS-ResourceSet with higher layer parameter trs-Info configured
- \( O_{C P U}=1 \) for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set][ndex', 'ssb-Index-RSRPCapability[Set]Index', 'cri-S[NR-Capability[Set]Index', 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index 'or 'none' (and CSI-RS-ResourceSet with higher layer parameter trs-Info not configured)
- for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI',
- if \( \max \left\{\mu_{P O C C H}, \mu_{C S I-R S}, \mu_{U L}\right\} \leqslant 3 \), and if a CSI report is aperiodically triggered without transmitting a PUSCH with either transport block or HARQ-ACK or both when \( L=0 \) CPUs are occupied, where the CSI corresponds to a single CSI with wideband frequency-granularity and to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and where codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel' or where reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', \( O_{C P U}=N_{C P U} \),
- [If a CSI-ReportConfig is configured with codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement is configured with two Resource Groups and \( N \) Resource Pairs, \( O_{C P U}=2 N+M \), where \( M \) is defined in clause 5.2.1.4.2.]
- otherwise, \( O_{C P U}=K_{S} \), where \( K_{s} \) is the number of CSI-RS resources in the CSI-RS resource set for channel measurement.

For a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity not set to 'none', the CPU(s) are occupied for a number of OFDM symbols as follows:
- A periodic or semi-persistent CSI report (excluding an initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH triggering the report) occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol of the earliest one of each CSI-RS/CSI[M/SSB resource for channel or interference measurement, respective latest CSI-RS/CSI-[M/SSB occasion no later than the corresponding CSI reference resource, until the last symbol of the configured PUSCH/PUCCH carrying the report.
- An aperiodic CSI report occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.
- An initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH trigger occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH until the last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the CPU occupation duration, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.

For a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none' and CSI-RSResourceSet with higher layer parameter trs-Info not configured, the CPU(s) are occupied for a number of OFDM symbols as follows:
- A semi-persistent CSI report (excluding an initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH triggering the report) occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol of the earliest one of each transmission occasion of periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel measurement for L1-RSRP computation, until \( Z_{3}^{\prime} \) symbols after the last symbol of the latest one of the CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel measurement for L1RSRP computation in each transmission occasion.
- An aperiodic CSI report occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol between \( Z_{3} \) symbols after the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the CSI report and \( Z_{3}^{\prime} \) symbols after the last symbol of the latest one of each CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel measurement for L1RSRP computation.
