- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna port mapping with indices of \( \{2,9,10,11 \) or 12\} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-1A and \( \{2,9,10,11,30 \) or 31\( \} \) in Table 7.3.1.2.2-2A of Clause 7.3.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], or
- if a UE is scheduled with two codewords,
the UE may assume that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE.

For DM-RS configuration type 2,
- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna port mapping with indices of \{2,10 or 23) in Table 7.3.1.2.2-3 and Table 7.3.1.2.2-4 of Clause 7.3.1.2 of [5, TS38.212], or
- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna port mapping with indices of \( \{2,10,23 \) or 24\} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-3A and \( \{2,10,23 \) or 58, in Table 7.3.1.2.2-4A of Clause 7.3.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], or
- if a UE is scheduled with two codewords,
the UE may assume that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE.

If a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _2 is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-J-2 or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-J-2 or a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) or DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA or dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCHMappingTypeB, the UE may assume that the following configurations are not occurring simultaneously for the received PDSCH:
- any DM-RS ports among 1004-1007 or 1006-1011 for DM-RS configurations type 1 and type 2, respectively are scheduled for the UE and the other UE(s) sharing the DM-RS REs on the same CDM group(s), and
- PT-RS is transmitted to the UE.

The UE is not expected to simultaneously be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter maxLength being set equal to 'len2' and more than one additional DM-RS symbol as given by the higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition.

The UE is not expected to assume co-scheduled UE(s) with different DM-RS configuration with respect to the actual number of front-loaded DM-RS symbol(s), the actual number of additional DM-RS, the DM-RS symbol location, and DM-RS configuration type as described in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211].

The UE does not expect the precoding of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be different in the PRG-level grid configured to this UE with PRG \( =2 \) or 4 .

The UE does not expect the resource allocation of the potential co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be misaligned in the PRG-level grid to this UE with PRG=2 or 4 .

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _1, the UE shall assume that the CDM groups indicated in the configured index from Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-2A, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] contain potential co-scheduled downlink DM-RS and are not used for data transmission, where " 1 ", " 2 " and " 3 " for the number of DM-RS CDM group(s) in Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-3, 7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of [5, TS. 38.212] correspond to CDM group \( 0,\{0,1\},\{0,1,2\} \), respectively.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0,4 \_0 \), or \( 4 \_1 \), the UE shall assume the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 1 which corresponds to CDM group 0 for the case of PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols, and the UE shall assume that the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 2 which corresponds to CDM group \( \{0,1\} \) for all other cases.

The UE is not expected to receive PDSCH scheduling DCI which indicates CDM group(s) with potential DM-RS ports which overlap with any configured CSI-RS resource(s) for that UE.

If the UE receives the DM-RS for PDSCH and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that the DM-RS and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with 'typeD', if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the
