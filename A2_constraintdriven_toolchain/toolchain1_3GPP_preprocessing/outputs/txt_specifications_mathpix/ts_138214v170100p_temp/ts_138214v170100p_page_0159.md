For PUSCH transmissions with a Type 1 configured grant, when two SRS resource sets are configured in srsResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2, if configuredGrantConfig contains only one pathlossReferenceIndex, p0-PUSCH-Alpha, powerControlLoopToUse, srs-ResourceIndicator and precodingAndNumberOfLayers (applicable when higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook'), PUSCH repetitions are associated only with the first SRS resource set.

If the UE is provided two SRS resource sets in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', and the UE is not provided p0-PUSCH-Alpha2 and powerControlLoopToUse2, for a retransmission of a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH, or for activation or retransmission of a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH, scheduled by a DCI format that includes an SRS resource set indicator field, the UE expects the value of the SRS resource set indicator field to be set to ' 00 ', and PUSCH repetitions are associated only with the first SRS resource set.

The UE shall not transmit anything on the resources configured by configuredGrantConfig if the higher layers did not deliver a transport block to transmit on the resources allocated for uplink transmission without grant.

A set of allowed periodicities \( P \) are defined in [12, TS 38.331]. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofSlots, provides the number of consecutive slots allocated within a configured grant period. The higher layer parameter cg-nrofPUSCHInSlot provides the number of consecutive PUSCH allocations within a slot, where the first PUSCH allocation follows the higher layer parameter timeDomainAllocation for Type 1 PUSCH transmission or the higher layer configuration according to [10, TS 38.321], and UL grant received on the DCI for Type 2 PUSCH transmissions, and the remaining PUSCH allocations have the same length and PUSCH mapping type, and are appended following the previous allocations without any gaps. The same combination of start symbol and length and PUSCH mapping type repeats over the consecutively allocated slots.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, and when the higher layer parameter ueSemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is not configured, where a UE is performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM symbols on all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension \( T_{\text {ext }} \) to be applied for transmission according to [4, TS 38.211] where the index for \( \Delta_{i} \) [4, TS 38.211] is chosen randomly from a set of values configured by higher layers according to the following rule:
- If the first such UL transmission is within a channel occupancy initiated by the gNB (defined in Clause 4 of [16, TS 37.213]), the set of values is determined by cg-StartingFullBW-InsideCOT;
- otherwise, the set of values is determined by cg-StartingFullBW-OutsideCOT.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, and when the higher layer parameter ueSemiStaticChannelAccessConfig is not configured, where a UE is performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM symbols on fewer than all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension \( T_{\text {ext }} \) to be applied for transmission according to [4, TS 38.211] according to the following rule:
- If the first such UL transmission is within a channel occupancy initiated by the gNB (defined in Clause 4 of [16, TS 37.213]), the index for \( \Delta_{i} \) [4, TS 38.211] is equal to cg-StartingPartialBW-InsideCOT;
- otherwise, the index for \( \Delta_{i} \) [4, TS 38.211] is equal to cg-StartingPartialBW-OutsideCOT.
6.1.2.3.1 Transport Block repetition for uplink transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant

The procedures described in this clause apply to PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant.

The higher layer parameter rep \( K-R V \) defines the redundancy version pattern to be applied to the repetitions. If cgRetransmissionTimer is provided, the redundancy version for uplink transmission with a configured grant is determined by the UE. If the parameter repK-RV is not provided in the configuredGrantConfig and cg-RetransmissionTimer is not provided, the redundancy version for uplink transmissions with a configured grant shall be set to 0 . If the parameter repK-RV is provided in the configuredGrantConfig and cg-RetransmissionTimer is not provided, for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among \( K \) repetitions, \( n=1,2, \ldots, K \), it is associated with \( (\bmod ((n-\bmod (n, N)) / N, 4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the configured RV sequence, where \( N=1 \). If a configured grant configuration is configured with startingFromRVO set to
