symbol \( S \) is relative to the starting symbol \( S_{0} \) of the PDCCH monitoring occasion where DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) is detected; when the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time is used for the purpose of determining the starting symbol \( S_{0} \);
- otherwise, the starting symbol \( S \) is relative to the start of the slot using \( S_{0}=0 \).
- The number of consecutive symbols \( L \) counting from the starting symbol \( S \) allocated for the PDSCH are determined from the start and length indicator SLIV:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text { if } \begin{aligned}
(L-1) & \leq 7 \text { then } \\
S L I V & =14 \cdot(L-1)+S
\end{aligned}
\end{array}
\]
else
\[
S L I V=14 \cdot(14-L+1)+(14-1-S)
\]
where \( 0<L \leq 14-S \), and
- the PDSCH mapping type is set to Type A or Type B as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS 38.211].

The UE shall consider the \( S \) and \( L \) combinations defined in table 5.1.2.1-1 satisfying \( S_{0}+S+L \leq 14 \) for normal cyclic prefix and \( S_{0}+S+L \leq 12 \) for extended cyclic prefix as valid PDSCH allocations:

When configured with SCS \( \mu=5 \) or \( \mu=6 \), the UE does not expect to be scheduled with more than one unicast PDSCH in a slot, by a single DCI scheduling multiple PDSCHs or by multiple DCIs.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-CRNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is configured with pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \), the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor, in sps-Config if configured, or across the pdschAggregationFactor in pdsch-config otherwise, consecutive slots. The UE may expect that the TB is repeated within each symbol allocation among each of the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots and the PDSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CSRNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format 1_1 or 1_2, the UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the reception of pdschAggregationFactor repetitions, in sps-Config if configured, or across the pdsch-AggregationFactor in pdsch-config otherwise, larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity P obtained from the corresponding sps-Config. The redundancy version to be applied on the \( n^{\text {th }} \) transmission occasion of the TB, where \( n=0,1, \ldots p d s c h \) -AggregationFactor-1, is determined according to table 5.1.2.1-2 and " \( r v_{1 d} \) indicated by the DCl scheduling the PDSCH" in table 5.1.2.1-2 is assumed to be 0 for PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using sps-Config and activated by DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_2 \).

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_0,4 \_1 \), or \( 4 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is configured with pdsch-AggregationFactor in the pdsch-Config-Multicast associated with the corresponding G-RNTI, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_0,4 \_1 \), or \( 4 \_2 \) for multicast reception in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI with NDI \( =0 \), or PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH transmission using associated [SPS-Config-Multicast] and activated by the DCI format \( 4 \_0,4 \_1 \), or \( 4 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdsch-AggregationFactor, in associated
