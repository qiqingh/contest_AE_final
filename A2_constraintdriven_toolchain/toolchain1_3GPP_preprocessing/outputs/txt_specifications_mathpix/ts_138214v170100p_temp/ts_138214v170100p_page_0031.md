- DataRateCC [Mbps] is computed as the maximum data rate for a carrier in the frequency band of the serving cell for any signaled band combination and feature set consistent with the serving cell, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2 in [13, TS 38.306], including the scaling factor \( f(i) \).
5.1.3.1 Modulation order and target code rate determination

For the PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), format \( 1 \_1 \), format \( 1 \_2 \), format \( 4 \_0 \), format \( 4 \_1 \) or format \( 4 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, TC-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or P-RNTI, or for the PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmissions using the higher-layer-provided PDSCH configuration SPS-Config or SPS-Config-Multicast,
if the higher layer parameter mcs-Table-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-4 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif mcs-TableDCI-1-2-r17 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam1024', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-4 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the higher layer parameter mcs-TableDCI-1-2 given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam256', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the UE is not configured with MCS-C-RNTI, the higher layer parameter mcs-TableDCI-1-2 given by PDSCHConfig is set to 'qam64LowSE', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) scrambled by C-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-3 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the higher layer parameter mcs-Table given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam256', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format 1_1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the higher layer parameter mcs-Table given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast is set to 'qam256', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) or \( 4 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the higher layer parameter mcs-Table given by PDSCH-Config-MCCH and PDSCH-Config-MTCH is set to 'qam256', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 4 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by MCCH-RNTI or GRNTI for MTCH
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the higher layer parameter mcs-Table given by PDSCH-Config-Multicast is set to 'qam64LowSE', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) or \( 4 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-3 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical downlink shared channel.
elseif the UE is not configured with MCS-C-RNTI, the higher layer parameter mcs-Table given by PDSCH-Config is set to 'qam64LowSE', and the PDSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with a DCI format other than DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) in a UE-specific search space with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI
