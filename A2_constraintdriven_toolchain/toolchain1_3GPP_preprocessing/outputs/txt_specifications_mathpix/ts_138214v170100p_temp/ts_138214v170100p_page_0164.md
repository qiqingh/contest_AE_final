- DataRate [Mbps] is computed as the maximum data rate summed over all the carriers in the frequency range for any signaled band combination and feature set consistent with the configured servings cells, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1 .2 in [13, TS 38.306], including the scaling factor \( f(i) \).

For a \( j \)-th serving cell, if higher layer parameter processingType2 Enabled of PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is configured for the serving cell and set to 'enable', or if at least one \( I_{M C S}>W \) for a PUSCH, where \( W=28 \) for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-1 and 5.1.3.1-3, and \( W=27 \) for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-2, 6.1.4.1-1, and 6.1.4.1-2, or if it is an actual repetition for PUSCH repetition Type B, the UE is not required to handle PUSCH transmissions, if the following condition is not satisfied:
\[
\frac{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} V_{j, m}}{L \times T_{s}^{\mu}} \leq \text { DataRateCC }
\]
where
- \( L \) is the number of symbols assigned to the PUSCH
- \( M \) is the number of TB in the PUSCH
- \( T_{s}^{\mu}=\frac{10^{-3}}{2^{\mu \cdot} N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }}} \) where \( \mu \) is the numerology of the PUSCH
- for the \( m \)-th TB, \( V_{j, m}=C^{\prime} \cdot\left\lfloor\frac{A}{c}\right\rfloor \)
- \( A \) is the number of bits in the transport block as defined in Clause 6.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
- \( C \) is the total number of code blocks for the transport block defined in Clause 5.2.2 [5, TS 38.212]
- \( C^{\prime} \) is the number of scheduled code blocks for the transport block as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
- DataRateCC [Mbps] is computed as the maximum data rate for a carrier in the frequency band of the serving cell for any signaled band combination and feature set consistent with the serving cell, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2 in [13, TS 38.306], including the scaling factor \( f(i) \)
- each actual repetition for PUSCH repetition type B is treated as one PUSCH.
6.1.4.1 Modulation order and target code rate determination

For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant or for a PUSCH scheduled by a fallbackRAR UL grant or for a MsgA PUSCH transmission, or for a PUSCH scheduled by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, TC-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or for a PUSCH scheduled by a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CSRNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, or
for a PUSCH with configured grant using CS-RNTI, and
if transform precoding is disabled for this PUSCH transmission according to Clause 6.1.3
- if mcs-TableDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'qam256', and PUSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI,
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-2 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical uplink shared channel;
- elseif the UE is not configured with MCS-C-RNTI, mcs-TableDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config is set to 'qam64LowSE', and the PUSCH is scheduled by a PDCCH by a PDCCH with DCI format 02 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI,
- the UE shall use \( I_{M C S} \) and Table 5.1.3.1-3 to determine the modulation order ( \( Q_{m} \) ) and Target code rate ( \( R \) ) used in the physical uplink shared channel.
