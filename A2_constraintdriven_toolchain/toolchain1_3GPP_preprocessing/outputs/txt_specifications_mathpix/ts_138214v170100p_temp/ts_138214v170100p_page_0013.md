HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook of the same priority. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol \( j \) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \) on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \( i \) of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \) is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than \( N \) symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of \( N \) depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) with \( N=13 \) for \( \mu=0, N=13 \) for \( \mu=1, N=20 \) for \( \mu=2, N=24 \) for \( \mu=3, N=96 \) for \( \mu=5 \), and \( N=192 \) for \( \mu=6 \).

When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, G-RNTI for broadcast or MCCH-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI, or MSGB-RNTI, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE used for RACH association as applicable, and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI in response to a random access procedure triggered by a PDCCH order which triggers contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell [10, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of the received PDCCH order and the DM-RS ports of the corresponding PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI are quasi co-located with the same SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.

When receiving PDSCH in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH retransmission, or when receiving PDSCH in response to a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure, or a PUSCH scheduled by a fallbackRAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH retransmission, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE selected for RACH association and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.

If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission for at least one serving cell configured with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on serving cell \( c_{1} \) and serving cell \( c_{2} \), the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH on serving cell \( c_{1} \) if the PDSCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [10]) on serving cell \( c_{2} \) not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission.

The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH in a serving cell scheduled by a PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and one or multiple PDSCH(s) required to be received according to this Clause in the same serving cell without a corresponding PDCCH transmission if the PDSCHs partially or fully overlap in time except if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH ends at least \( 14 \cdot 2^{\max (0, \mu-3)} \) symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, where \( \mu \) and the symbol duration are based on the smallest numerology between the scheduling PDCCH and the PDSCH, in which case the UE shall decode the PDSCH scheduled by the PDCCH. When the PDCCH reception incudes two PDCCH candidates from two respectvie search space sets, as described in clause 10 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling the PDSCH ends at least \( 14 \cdot 2^{\max (0, \mu-3)} \) symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s) without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.

The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI if another PDSCH in the same cell scheduled with RA-RNTI or MSGB-RNTI partially or fully overlap in time.

The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes shall be able to decode two PDSCHs each scheduled with SIRNTI, P-RNTI, RA-RNTI or TC-RNTI, with the two PDSCHs partially or fully overlapping in time in non-overlapping PRBs.

The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes:
- is expected to decode PDSCH scheduled with MCCH-RNTI and PBCH in Pcell that partially or fully overlaps in time in non-overlapping PRBs
