When a UE is configured by higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to one of 'fdmSchemeA', 'fdmSchemeB', 'tdmSchemeA', if the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)'.
- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'fdmSchemeA', the UE shall receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion of the TB with each TCI state associated to a non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation as described in Clause 5.1.2.3.
- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'fdmSchemeB', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission occasion which has non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation with respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion as described in Clause 5.1.2.3.
- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to 'tdmSchemeA', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission occasion which has non-overlapping time domain resource allocation with respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion and both PDSCH transmission occasions shall be received within a given slot as described in Clause 5.1.2.1.

When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation, the UE may expect to be indicated with one or two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication' together with the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)'.
- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI with 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field, the UE may expect to receive multiple slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with two TCI states used across multiple PDSCH transmission occasions in the repetitionNumber consecutive slots as defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.
- When one TCI state is indicated in a DCI with 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field, the UE may expect to receive multiple slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with one TCI state used across multiple PDSCH transmission occasions in the repetitionNumber consecutive slots as defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation, and it is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within two CDM groups in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)' and it is not configured with higher layer parameter sfnSchemePdsch, the UE may expect to receive a single PDSCH where the association between the DM-RS ports and the TCI states are as defined in Clause 5.1.6.2.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation, and it is indicated with one TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication', the UE procedure for receiving the PDSCH upon detection of a PDCCH follows Clause 5.1.

When a UE is configured with higher layer parameter sfnSchemePdsch set to either 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB' for a DL BWP and
- if the UE reports its capability of [dynamicSFN], the UE is indicated with one or two TCI state(s) in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in DCI format \( 1 \_1 / 1 \_2 \), or
- otherwise, the UE is not expected to be indicated with one TCI state per any of TCI codepoint by MAC CE, and the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in DCI format 1_1/1_2, and
the UE procedure for receiving the PDSCH upon detection of a PDCCH follows clause 5.1 and the QCL assumption for the PDSCH as defined in clause 5.1.5.

When a UE is configured with both sfnSchemePdsch and sfnSchemePdcch, the UE shall expect that sfnSchemePdsch and sfnSchemePdcch are set to the same scheme, either 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB'.

When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch and/or sfnSchemePdcch, the UE shall expect that the sfnSchemePdsch and/or sfnSchemePdcch configuration are the same in all DL BWP within a CC other than initial BWP, and the UE shall
