When the UE performs periodic-based partial sensing and contiguous partial sensing, and when the UE is triggered to perform re-evaluation and pre-emption checking, and if Prsvp_TX \( \neq 0 \),
- During the \( q^{\text {th }} \) reservation period ( \( q=0,1,2, \ldots, \operatorname{Cresel}-1 \) ), candidate resource set ( \( S_{A} \) ) is initialized to the remaining \( Y \) candidate slots starting from slot \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) and ending at the last slot of the \( Y \) candidate slots, where the slot indices of the remaining \( Y \) candidate slots are equal to \( \left[q \times P_{r s v p_{-}} F_{x}+t_{y}^{S L}\right] \), where \( t_{y}^{S L} \) is a slot index of \( Y \) candidate slots used in the initial resource (re)selection.
- \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) is the first candidate slot after slot \( n+T_{3} \).
- The UE performs PBPS for the remaining \( Y \) candidate slots according to \( t_{\mathbf{y}^{\prime}-\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{P}_{\text {reserve }}}^{S L} \), where \( t_{\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}}^{S L} \) is a slot belonging to the remaining \( Y \) candidate slots, and \( k \) and \( P_{\text {reserve }} \) are the same as resource (re)selection, where the values of \( k \) correspond to the most recent sensing occasion earlier than \( \left[t_{y i}^{S L}\right]-\left(T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L}+T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L}\right) \) if additionalPeriodicSensingOccasion is not (pre-)configured, and additionally includes the value of \( k \) corresponding to the last periodic sensing occasion prior to the most recent one if additionalPeriodicSensingOccasion is (pre-)configured.
- The UE performs CPS starting from \( M \) logical slots earlier than \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) to \( T_{p r o c, 0}^{S L}+T_{p r o c, 1}^{S L} \) slots earlier than \( t_{y i}^{S L} \).
- By default, \( M \) is 31 unless (pre-)configured with another value. by contiguousSensingWindowPeriodic.

When the UE is triggered to perform re-evaluation and pre-emption checking, and if Prsvp_TX \( =0 \),
- Candidate resource set \( \left(S_{A}\right) \) is initialized to the remaining \( Y^{\prime} \) candidate slots starting from slot \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) and ending at the last slot of the \( Y^{\prime} \) candidate slots, where \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) is the first candidate slot after slot \( n+T_{3} \).
- It is up to UE implementation that UE may perform PBPS for periodic sensing occasions after the resource (re)selection when higher layer parameter si-MultiReserveResource is enabled
