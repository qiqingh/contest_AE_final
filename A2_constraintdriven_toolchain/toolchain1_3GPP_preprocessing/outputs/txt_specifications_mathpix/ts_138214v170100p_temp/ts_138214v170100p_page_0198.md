In case of inter-slot frequency hopping, the starting RB during slot \( n_{s}^{\mu} \) follows that of inter-slot frequency hopping for PUSCH Repetition Type A in Clause 6.3.1.
6.4 UE PUSCH preparation procedure time

If the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation for a transport block, including the DM-RS, as defined by the slot offset \( K_{2} \) and \( K_{0} \) Iset, if configured, and the start \( S \) and length \( L \) of the PUSCH allocation indicated by Time domain resource assignment' of the scheduling DCI and including the effect of the timing advance, is no earlier than at symbol \( L_{2} \), where \( L_{2} \) is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting \( T_{\text {prom } 2}=\max \left(\left(N_{2}+d_{2,1}+d_{2}\right)(2048+144) \cdot \kappa 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}+T_{\text {ext }}+T_{\text {mink }}, d_{2,2}\right) \) after the end of the reception of the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH, then the UE shall transmit the transport block. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.
- \( \quad N_{2} \) is based on \( \mu \) of Table 6.4-1 and Table 6.4-2 for UE processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where \( \mu \) corresponds to the one of ( \( \mu_{D L}, \mu_{U L} \) ) resulting with the largest \( T_{\text {proc. } 2} \), where the \( \mu_{D L} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the downlink with which the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH was transmitted and \( \mu_{u l} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the uplink channel with which the PUSCH is to be transmitted, and \( \kappa \) is defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211].
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, \( T_{\text {ext }} \) is calculated according to [4, TS 38.211], otherwise \( T_{\text {ex }} =0 \).
- If the first symbol of the PUSCH allocation consists of DM-RS only, then \( d_{2, /}=0 \), otherwise \( d_{2, /}=1 \).
- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation further includes the effect of timing difference between component carriers as given in [11, TS 38.133].
- If the scheduling DCI triggered a switch of \( \mathrm{BWP}, d_{2,2} \) equals to the switching time as defined in [11, TS 38.133], otherwise \( d_{2,2}=0 \).
- If a PUSCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH of a smaller priority index, \( d_{2} \) for the PUSCH of a larger priority is set as reported by the UE; otherwise \( d_{2}=0 \).
- For a UE that supports capability 2 on a given cell, the processing time according to UE processing capability 2 is applied if the high layer parameter processingType2Enabled in PUSCH-ServingCellConfig is configured for the cell and set to 'enable',
- If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with one or more PUCCH channels, then the transport block is multiplexed following the procedure in clause 9.2 .5 of [6, TS 38.213], otherwise the transport block is transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by the DCI.
- If uplink switching gap is triggered as defined in clause \( 6.1 .6, T_{\text {incent }} \) equals to the switching gap duration and for the UE configured with higher layer parameter uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL' for uplink carrier aggregation \( \mu_{U L}=\min \left(\mu_{U L, \text { carrier } 1}, \mu_{U L, \text { carrier } 2}\right) \), otherwise \( T_{\text {make }}=0 \).

Otherwise the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI.
The value of \( T_{\text {proc }, 2} \) is used both in the case of normal and extended cyclic prefix.
