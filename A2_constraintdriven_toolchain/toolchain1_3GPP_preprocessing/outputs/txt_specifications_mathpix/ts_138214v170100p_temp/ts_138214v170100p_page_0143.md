6.1.2.1-1A, based on whether or not the higher layer parameter numberOfMsg3Repetitions is configured. The number of slots used for TBS determination \( N \) is equal to 1 .

For PUSCH repetition type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TCRNTI, the 2 MSBs of the MCS information field of the DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI provide a codepoint to determine the number of repetitions \( K \) according to Table 6.1.2.1-1A, based on whether or not the higher layer parameter numberOfMsg3Repetitions is configured. The number of slots used for TBS determination N is equal to 1.

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH, the UE does not expect to be configured with pusch-AggregationFactor.

If a UE is configured with pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PUSCH on a UL BWP of a serving cell, the UE does not apply pusch-AggregationFactor, if configured, to DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) on the UL BWP of the serving cell and the UE does not expect to be configured with numberOfRepetitions in pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17.

If a UE is configured with pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PUSCH on a UL BWP of a serving cell, when any two UL DCIs end in the same symbol and at least one of the DCIs scheduling multiple PUSCHs, the UE does not expect that the any scheduled multiple PUSCHs have overlapping spans, where the span associated with a DCI is defined from the beginning of the first scheduled PUSCH till the end of the last scheduled PUSCH.

For unpaired spectrum:
- When AvailableSlotCounting is enabled, and in case \( K>1 \), the UE determines \( N \cdot K \) slots for a PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), based on tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon, tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated and ssb-PositionsInBurst, and the TDRA information field value in the DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \).
- A slot is not counted in the number of \( N \cdot K \) slots for PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DLConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst.
- Otherwise, the UE determines \( N \cdot K \) consecutive slots for a PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), based on the TDRA information field value in the DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \).
- The UE determines \( N \cdot K \) slots for a PUSCH transmission of TB processing over multiple slots scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), based on tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated and ssb-PositionsInBurst, and the TDRA information field value in the DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \).
- A slot is not counted in the number of \( N \cdot K \) slots for a PUSCH transmission of TB processing over multiple slots if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst.
