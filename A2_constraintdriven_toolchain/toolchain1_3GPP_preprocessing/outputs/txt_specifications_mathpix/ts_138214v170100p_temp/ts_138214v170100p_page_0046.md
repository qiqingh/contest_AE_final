the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the TCI state or QCL assumption whichever is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell.

When a UE is configured with both sfnSchemePdcch and sfnSchemePdsch scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) or by DCI format \( 1 \_1 / 1 \_2 \), if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable:
- if the UE supports DCI scheduling without TCI field, the UE assumes that the TCI state(s) or the QCL assumption(s) for the PDSCH is identical to the TCI state(s) or QCL assumption(s) whichever is applied for the CORESET used for the reception of the DL DCI within the active BWP of the serving cell regardless of the number of active TCI states of the CORESET. If the UE does not support dynamic switching between SFN PDSCH and non-SFN PDSCH, the UE should be activated with the CORESET with two TCI states.
- else if the UE does not support DCI scheduling without TCI field, the UE shall expect TCI field present when scheduled by DCI format 1_1/1_2.

When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch and sfnSchemePdcch is not configured, when scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_1 / 1 \_2 \), if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable, the UE shall expect TCI field present.

For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0,1 \_1,1 \_2 \), when a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and sfnSchemePdsch is not configured, and there is no TCI codepoint with two TCI states in the activation command, and if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal or larger than the threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable and the CORESET which schedules the PDSCH is indicated with two TCI states, the UE assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to the first TCI state or QCL assumption which is applied for the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the serving cell.

If a PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present, the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the UE shall use the TCI-State according to the value of the 'Transmission Configuration Indication' field in the detected PDCCH with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306]. For a single slot PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH or the UE is configured with higher layer parameter [pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r177, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in the first slot with the scheduled \( \operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \), and UE shall expect the activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled \( \operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \). When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search space set for crosscarrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, the UE expects tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, and if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell scheduled by the search space set contains qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected PDCCH in the search space set and a corresponding PDSCH is larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL.

Independent of the configuration of tci-PresentInDCI and tci-PresentDCI-1-2 in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL and at least one configured TCI state for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains qci-Type set to 'typeD',
- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of \( \operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \) of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the qcl-Type is set to 'typeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers).
- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in different ControlResourceSets,
- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH associated with a value of coresetPoolIndex of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi
