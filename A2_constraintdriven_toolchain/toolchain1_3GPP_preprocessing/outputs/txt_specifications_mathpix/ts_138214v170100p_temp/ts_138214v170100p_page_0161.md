- For paired spectrum and SUL band:
- The UE shall repeat the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, except if the UE is provided with higher layer parameters cg-nrofSlots and cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot, in which case the UE repeats the TB in the repK earliest consecutive transmission occasion candidates within the same configuration.
- If AvailableSlotCounting is enabled, and in case of reduced capability half-duplex UE, the UE shall repeat the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot. A slot is not counted in the number of \( N \cdot K \) slots if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst.

A Type 1 or Type 2 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant in a slot is omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 17.2 of [6, TS 38.213].
6.1.2.3.2 Transport Block repetition for uplink transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type B with a configured grant

The procedures described in this Clause apply to PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type B with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant.

For PUSCH transmissions with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant, the nominal repetitions and the actual repetitions are determined according to the procedures for PUSCH repetition Type B defined in Clause 6.1.2.1. The higher layer configured parameters repK-RV defines the redundancy version pattern to be applied to the repetitions. If the parameter repK-RV is not provided in the configuredGrantConfig, the redundancy version for each actual repetition with a configured grant shall be set to 0 . Otherwise, for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among all the actual repetitions (including the actual repetitions that are omitted) of the \( K \) nominal repetitions, it is associated with (mod(n-mod) \( n \), \( N) /(N, 4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the configured RV sequence, where \( N=1 \). If a configured grant configuration is configured with startingFromRV0 set to 'off', the initial transmission of a transport block may only start at the first transmission occasion of the actual repetitions. Otherwise, the initial transmission of a transport block may start at
- the first transmission occasion of the actual repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,2,3,1\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the actual repetitions that are associated with \( R V=0 \) if the configured \( R V \) sequence is \( \{0,3,0,3\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the actual repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,0,0,0\} \), except the actual repetitions within the last nominal repetition when \( K \geq 8 \).

When the transmission occasions are associated with the first and second SRS resource sets, if the parameter repK-RV is provided in the configuredGrantConfig, for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among all actual repetitions (including the actual repetitions that are omitted) that are associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion, it is associated with \( (\bmod (n-1,4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the configured RV sequence, and for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among all actual repetitions that are not associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion, it is associated with \( (\bmod (n-1,4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the adjusted RV sequence and the adjustment is based on additional shifting operation on the configured RV sequence, where the shifting operation is defined as \( \left(r v_{i}+r v_{s}\right) \bmod 4 \) where \( r v_{i} \) is the \( i^{\text {th }} \) RV value ( \( i=1,2,3,4 \) ) in the configured RV sequence and \( r v_{s} \) is configured by the higher layer parameter sequenceOffsetforRV in configuredGrantConfig. When the transmission occasions are associated with the first and second SRS resource sets, if a configured grant configuration is configured with startingFromRVO set to 'off', the initial transmission of a transport block may only start at the first transmission occasion of the \( K \) repetitions. Otherwise, the initial transmission of a transport block may start at
- the first transmission occasion associated with RV \( =0 \) corresponding to the first or second SRS resource set of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,2,3,1\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions that are associated with RV=0 if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,3,0,3\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,0,0,0\} \), except the last transmission occasion when \( K \geq 8 \).
