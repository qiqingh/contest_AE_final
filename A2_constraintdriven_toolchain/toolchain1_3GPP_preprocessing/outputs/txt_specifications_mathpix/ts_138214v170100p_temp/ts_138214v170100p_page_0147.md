- otherwise, the UE does not apply the invalid symbol pattern;
- otherwise, the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern.
- If the UE
- is configured with multiple serving cells within a cell group and is provided with directionalCollisionHanding-r16 = 'enabled' for a set of serving cell(s) among the multiple serving cells, and
- indicates support of half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r 16 capability, and
- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format \( 2-0 \) on any of the multiple serving cells,
- a symbol indicated to the UE for reception of SS/PBCH blocks in a first cell of the multiple serving cells by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon is considered as an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission in
- any of the multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA among the multiple serving cells, and
- any one of the cells corresponding to the same band as the first cell, irrespective of any capability indicated by simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA
and
- a symbol is considered as an invalid symbol in another cell among the set of serving cell(s) provided with directionalCollisionHanding-r16 for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission with Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant except for the first Type 2 PUSCH transmission (including all repetitions) after activation if the symbol is indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-Configuration Common or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated on the reference cell as defined in Clause 11.1 of [6, TS 38.213], or the UE is configured by higher layers to receive \( \mathrm{PDCCH}, \mathrm{PDSCH} \), or CSI-RS on the reference cell in the symbol.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, after determining the invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition type B transmission for each of the \( K \) nominal repetitions, the remaining symbols are considered as potentially valid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. If the number of potentially valid symbols for PUSCH repetition type B transmission is greater than zero for a nominal repetition, the nominal repetition consists of one or more actual repetitions, where each actual repetition consists of a consecutive set of all potentially valid symbols that can be used for PUSCH repetition Type \( B \) transmission within a slot. An actual repetition with a single symbol is omitted except for the case of \( L=1 \). An actual repetition is omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 17.2 of [6, TS 38.213]. The UE shall repeat the TB across actual repetitions. The redundancy version to be applied on the \( n \)th actual repetition (with the counting including the actual repetitions that are omitted) is determined according to table 6.1.2.1-2, where \( N=1 \).

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a UE receives a DCI that schedules aperiodic CSI report(s) or activates semipersistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH with no transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the number of nominal repetitions is always assumed to be 1 , regardless of the value of numberOfRepetitions. When the UE is scheduled to transmit a PUSCH repetition Type B with no transport block and with aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI report(s) by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the first nominal repetition is expected to be the same as the first actual repetition. For PUSCH repetition Type B carrying semi-persistent CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH after being activated on PUSCH by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, if the first nominal repetition is not the same as the first actual repetition, the first nominal repetition is omitted; otherwise, the first nominal repetition is omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 17.2 of [6, TS 38.213].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the CSI report(s) is multiplexed only on the first actual repetition. The UE does not expect that the first actual repetition has a single symbol duration.

If pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH in pusch-Config contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous PUSCHs, \( K_{2} \) indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and mapping type. The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated valid SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH signalled in DCI format \( 0 \_1 \).
