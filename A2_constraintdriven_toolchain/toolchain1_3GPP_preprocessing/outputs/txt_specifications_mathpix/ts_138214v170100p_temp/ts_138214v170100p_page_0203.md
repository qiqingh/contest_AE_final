ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- The UE shall not transmit PSSCH in the symbol immediately preceding the symbols which are configured for use by PSFCH, if PSFCH is configured in this slot.

In sidelink resource allocation mode 1:
- For sidelink dynamic grant, the PSSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format \( 3 \_0 \).
- For sidelink configured grant type 2 , the configured grant is activated by a DCI format \( 3 \_0 \).
- For sidelink dynamic grant and sidelink configured grant type 2:
- The "Time gap" field value \( m \) of the DCI format \( 3 \_0 \) provides an index \( m+1 \) into a slot offset table. That table is given by higher layer parameter \( s / \)-DCI-ToSL-Trans and the table value at index \( m+1 \) will be referred to as slot offset \( K_{S L} \).
- The slot of the first sidelink transmission scheduled by the DCI is the first SL slot of the corresponding resource pool that starts not earlier than \( T_{\mathrm{DL}}-\frac{T_{\mathrm{TA}}}{2}+K_{S L} \times T_{\text {slot }} \), where \( T_{\mathrm{DL}} \) is the starting time of the downlink slot carrying the corresponding \( \mathrm{DCI}, T_{\mathrm{TA}} \) is the timing advance value corresponding to the TAG of the serving cell on which the DCI is received and \( K_{S L} \) is the slot offset between the slot of the DCI and the first sidelink transmission scheduled by DCI and \( T_{\text {slot }} \) is the SL slot duration.
- The "Configuration index" field of the DCI format 3_0, if provided and not reserved, indicates the index of the sidelink configured type 2.
- For sidelink configured grant type 1:
- The slot of the first sidelink transmissions follows the higher layer configuration according to [10, TS 38.321].
8.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain

The resource allocation unit in the frequency domain is the sub-channel.
The sub-channel assignment for sidelink transmission is determined using the "Frequency resource assignment" field in the associated SCI.

The lowest sub-channel for sidelink transmission is the sub-channel on which the lowest PRB of the associated PSCCH is transmitted.

If a PSSCH scheduled by a PSCCH would overlap with resources containing the PSCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the PSCCH that scheduled the PSSCH and associated PSCCH DM-RS are not available for the PSSCH.
8.1.3 Modulation order, target code rate, redundancy version and transport block size determination

The redundancy version is given by the "Redundancy version" field in SCI format 2-A or 2-B.
8.1.3.1 Modulation order and target code rate determination
\( I_{M C S} \) is given by the 'Modulation and coding scheme' field in SCI format 1-A.
The MCS table is determined as follows: Table 5.1.3.1-1 is used if no additional MCS table is configured by higher layer parameter sl-Additional-MCS-Table; otherwise an MCS table is determined according to Table 8.1.3.1-1 or Table 8.1.3.1-2 and 'Additional MCS table indicator' field in SCI format 1-A.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline MCS table indicator & MCS table \\
\hline '0' & Table 5.1.3.1-1 \\
\hline '1' & \( 1^{\text {st }} \) table provided by higher layer parameter si-Additional-MCS-Table \\
