otherwise, where \( K_{o f f s e t} \) is a parameter configured by higher layer as specified in clause 4.2 of [6 TS 38.213], and where
- \( k \) is configured via higher layer parameter slotOffset for each aperiodic SRS resource in each triggered SRS resources set and is based on the subcarrier spacing of the triggered SRS transmission, \( \mu_{S R S} \) and \( \mu_{P D C C H} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command respectively;
- \( \mu_{K_{o f f s e t}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( K_{\text {offset }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 .
- \( N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {off set, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \( N_{\text {slot, offset, SRS }}^{C A} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, SRS }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot,offsel }}^{C A} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5.
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing' or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, or of the latest reference aperiodic CSI-RS. If the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS or of the reference aperiodic SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS.
- when a UE receives an spatial relation update command, as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource, and when the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the update command is transmitted in slot \( n \), the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame } \mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the update command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', the UE shall not expect to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set.

The UE is not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is also not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior between SRS resource and associated SRS resources set.

For operation in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be configured on overlapping symbols with a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource with resourceType of both SRS resources as 'periodic'.

For operation in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be activated or triggered to transmit SRS on overlapping symbols with a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource with resourceType of both SRS resources as 'semi-persistent' or 'aperiodic'.

For operations in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be configured on overlapping symbols with more than one SRS resources configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource with resourceType of the SRS resources as 'periodic'.
