3GPP TS 38.214 version 17.1.0 Release 17
200
ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

If the UE transmits SCI format 1-A on PSCCH according to a PSCCH resource configuration in slot \( n \) and PSCCH resource \( m \), then for the associated PSSCH transmission in the same slot
- one transport block is transmitted with up to two layers;
- The number of layers \( (v) \) is determined according to the 'Number of DMRS port' field in the SCI;
- The set of consecutive symbols within the slot for transmission of the PSSCH is determined according to clause 8.1.2.1;
- The set of contiguous resource blocks for transmission of the PSSCH is determined according to clause 8.1.2.2;

Transform precoding is not supported for PSSCH transmission.
Only wideband precoding is supported for PSSCH transmission.
The DM-RS antenna ports \( \left\{\tilde{p}_{0, \ldots, \tilde{v}_{v-1}}\right\} \) in Clause 8.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS38.211] are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by Tables 8.3.1.1-3 in Clause 8.3.1.1 of [5, TS 38.212].

The UE shall set the contents of the SCI format 2-A as follows:
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ process number' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'NDT' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Redundancy version' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Source ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Destination ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Cast type indicator' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'CSI request' field as indicated by higher layers.

The UE shall set the contents of the SCI formats 2-B as follows:
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ process number' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'NDT' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Redundancy version' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Source ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Destination ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Zone ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set the 'Communication range requirement' field as indicated by higher layers.

The UE shall set the contents of the SCI format 2-C as follows:
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ process number' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'NDI' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Redundancy version' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Source ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'Destination ID' field as indicated by higher layers.
- the UE shall set value of the 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' field as indicated by higher layers.
