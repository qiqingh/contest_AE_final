- UE performs CPS starting from at least \( M \) consecutive logical slots earlier than \( t_{y i}^{S L} \) to \( T_{p r o c, 0}^{S L}+T_{p r o c, 1}^{S L} \) slots earlier than \( t_{y i}^{S L} \)
- For minimum size M of the CPS monitoring window \( [n+T A, n+T B] \), by default, \( M \) is 31 unless (pre-)configured with another value, by contiguousSensingWindowAperiodic.

When the minimum \( M \) slots for CPS cannot be guaranteed, UE senses in all available slots starting from the resource (re)selection trigger slot of the same TB to \( T_{\text {proc }, 0}^{S L}+T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \) slots earlier than \( t_{y_{i}}^{S L} \). The UE re-evaluation and pre-emption checking is based on all available sensing results after \( \mathrm{n}-\mathrm{T} 0 \).
8.1.4A UE procedure for determining a set of preferred or non-preferred resources for another UE's transmission

When this procedure is triggered, the following parameters are provided by the higher layer:
- the resource pool from which the preferred or non-preferred resources are to be determined;
- the resource selection window \( \left[n+T_{1}, n+T_{2}\right] \) within which the preferred or non-preferred resources are to be determined;
- the resource set type (either preferred or non-preferred resource set);
- if the resource set type indicates preferred set, then the higher layer additionally provides the following parameters:
- L1 priority, prio \( o_{T X} \);
- the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH transmission in a slot, \( L_{\text {subcH }} \);
- the resource reservation period, \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }} \), if present.

The value of \( C_{\text {resel }} \) is determined by the UE according to clause 8.1.5.

When this procedure is triggered by another UE's explicit request, the fields in the request are interpreted as follows:
- The field 'Resource selection window location' is the concatenation of the starting time location and the ending time location of the resource selection window. The starting and ending time locations of the resource selection window are each encoded in the same way as the reference slot as described in clause 8.1.5A.
- The field 'Resource reservation period' is encoded in the same way as the field of the same name in SCI format 1-A.

When determining a preferred resource set, the UE applies the procedure described in clause 8.1.4 with the above parameters and the following modifications:
- Step 6a) The UE excludes candidate single-slot resource(s) belonging to slot(s) where the UE does not expect to perform SL reception of a TB due to half-duplex operation, if all the following conditions are met:
- the UE is a destination UE of the TB for whose transmission the preferred resource set is being determined;
- the higher layer parameter conditionlA2Schemel Disabled is not set to 'Disabled'.

When determining a non-preferred resource set, the UE considers any resource(s) within the resource selection window, if indicated by a received explicit request, and satisfying at least one of the following conditions as non-preferred resource(s):
- resource(s) indicated by a received [SCI format 1-A], satisfying at least one of the following criteria:
- the RSRP measurement performed, according to clause 8.4.2.1, for the received [SCI format 1-A], is higher than \( T h\left(\right. \) pri \( \left.o_{R X}\right) \) where pri \( o_{R X} \) is the value of the priority field in the received [SCI format 1-A]. The internal parameter \( T h\left(p_{i}\right) \) is set to the corresponding value of RSRP threshold indicated by the \( k \)-th field in thresholdRSRPCondition IB IOption I Schemel, where \( k=p_{i} \).
