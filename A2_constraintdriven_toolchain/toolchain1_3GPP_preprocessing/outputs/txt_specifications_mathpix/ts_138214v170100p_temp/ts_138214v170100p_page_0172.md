- for the UE configured with uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL', when the UE is to transmit in the uplink based on \( \mathrm{DCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) received before \( \boldsymbol{T}_{0}-\boldsymbol{T}_{\text {offset }} \) or based on a higher layer configuration(s):
- when the UE is to transmit an NR two-port uplink that takes place after an E-UTRA uplink on another uplink carrier then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the two carriers.
- when the UE is to transmit an E-UTRA uplink that takes place after an NR two-port uplink on another uplink carrier then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the two carriers.
- the UE is not expected to transmit simultaneously a two-port transmission on the NR uplink and the EUTRA uplink.
- in all other cases the UE is expected to transmit normally all uplink transmissions without interruptions.
- when the UE is configured with tdm-PatternConfig or by tdm-PatternConfig2
- for the E-UTRA subframes designated as uplink by the configuration, the UE assumes the operation state in which one-port E-UTRA uplink can be transmitted.
- for the E-UTRA subframes other than the ones designated as uplink by the configuration, the UE assumes the operation state in which two-port NR uplink can be transmitted.
6.1.6.2 Uplink switching for carrier aggregation

For a UE indicating a capability for uplink switching with BandCombination-UplinkTxSwitch or uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod2T2T for a band combination, and if it is for that band combination configured with uplink carrier aggregation:
- If the UE is configured with uplink switching with parameter uplinkTxSwitching, when the UE is to transmit in the uplink based on \( \mathrm{DCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) received before \( \boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{0}}-\boldsymbol{T}_{\text {off set }} \) or based on a higher layer configuration(s):
- When the UE is to transmit a 2-port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission is a 1-port transmission on another uplink carrier on another band, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- When the UE is to transmit a 1-port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission is a 2-port transmission on another uplink carrier on another band, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- For the UE configured with uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'switchedUL', when the UE is to transmit a 1port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission was a 1-port transmission on another uplink carrier on another band, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- For the UE configured with uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL', when the UE is to transmit a 2-port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission was a 1-port transmission on a carrier on the same band and the UE is under the operation state in which 2-port transmission cannot be supported in the same band, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{T} \times 1-\mathrm{T} \times 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- For the UE configured with uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL', when the UE is to transmit a 1-port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission was a 1-port transmission on another uplink carrier on another band and the UE is under the operation state in which 2port transmission can be supported on the same uplink carrier, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- For the UE configured with uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL', if the UE is configured with OneT with uplinkTxSwitching-DualUL-TxState, when the UE is under the operation state in which 2-port transmission can be supported on one carrier on one band followed by no transmission on any carrier on the same band and 1-port transmission on the other carrier on another band the UE shall consider this as if 1-port transmission was transmitted on both uplinks, otherwise the UE shall consider this as if 2-port transmission took place on the transmitting carrier.
