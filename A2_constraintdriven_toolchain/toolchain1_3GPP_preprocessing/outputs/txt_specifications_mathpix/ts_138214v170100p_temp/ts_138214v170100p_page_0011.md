Throughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, statements using the term "UE" in clauses 4, 5, or 6 are equally applicable to the \( I \mathrm{AB} \)-MT part of an \( I \mathrm{AB} \) node.
4.1 Power allocation for downlink

The gNB determines the downlink transmit EPRE.
For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant across the bandwidth. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant over SSS carried in different SS/PBCH blocks. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume that the ratio of SSS EPRE to PBCH DM-RS EPRE is 0 dB .

For the purpose of CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE of a port of CSI-RS resource configuration is constant across the configured downlink bandwidth and constant across all configured OFDM symbols.

The downlink SS/PBCH SSS EPRE can be derived from the SS/PBCH downlink transmit power given by the parameter ss-PBCH-BlockPower provided by higher layers. The downlink SSS transmit power is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in \( [\mathrm{W}] \) ) of all resource elements that carry the SSS within the operating system bandwidth.

The downlink CSI-RS EPRE can be derived from the SS/PBCH block downlink transmit power given by the parameter ss-PBCH-BlockPower and CSI-RS power offset given by the parameter powerControlOffsetSS provided by higher layers, where the CSI-RS is QCLed with the SS/PBCH block, and the SS/PBCH block can be associated with serving cell PCI or additional PCI different from serving cell PCI. The downlink reference-signal transmit power is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in \( [\mathrm{W}] \) ) of the resource elements that carry the configured CSI-RS within the operating system bandwidth.

For downlink DM-RS associated with PDSCH, the UE may assume the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE ( \( \left.\beta_{\text {DMRS }}[\mathrm{dB}]\right) \) is given by Table 4.1-1 according to the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data as described in
Clause 5.1.6.2. The DM-RS scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {PESCO }}^{D R R S} \) specified in Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS 38.211] is given by
\[
\beta_{\text {PDSCH }}^{\text {DARSS }}=10^{-\frac{\beta_{D A B S}}{20}}
\]
