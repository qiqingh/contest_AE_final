- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter epre-Ratio, the ratio of PT-RS EPRE to PDSCH EPRE per layer per RE for each PT-RS port ( \( \rho_{\text {PTRS }} \) ) is given by Table 4-1-2 according to the epre-Ratio, the PT-RS scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {TTRS }} \) specified in clause 7.4.1.2.2 of [4, TS 38.211] is given by \( \beta_{\text {PTRS }}=10^{\frac{\rho_{\text {PRTS }}}{20}} \).
- otherwise, the UE shall assume epre-Ratio is set to state ' 0 ' in Table 4.1-2 if not configured.

For link recovery, as described in clause 6 of [6, TS 38.213] the ratio of the PDCCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE is assumed as 0 dB .

5 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures
5.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel

For downlink, a maximum of 16 HARQ processes per cell are supported by the UE, or subject to UE capability, a maximum of 32 HARQ processes per cell as defined in [13, TS 38.306]. The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used for the downlink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by higher layer parameter nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH, and when no configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 8 processes.

A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \( 1 \_0,1 \_1,4 \_0,4 \_1,4 \_2 \) or \( 1 \_2 \) decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for \( \operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQfeedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until \( \mathrm{T}_{\text {proc, } 1} \) after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of \( N_{\text {sym }}^{\text {slot }} \) symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the
