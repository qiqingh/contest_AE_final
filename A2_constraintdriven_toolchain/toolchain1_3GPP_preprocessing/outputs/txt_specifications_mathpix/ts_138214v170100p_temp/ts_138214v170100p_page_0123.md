request, otherwise \( n_{C S I_{-} \text {ref }} \) is the smallest value greater than or equal to \( \left\lfloor Z^{\prime} / N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }}\right\rfloor \), such that slot \( n-n_{C S I_{-} \text {ref }} \) corresponds to a valid downlink slot, where \( Z^{\prime} \) corresponds to the delay requirement as defined in Clause 5.4.
- when periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-[M or SSB is used for channel/interference measurements, the UE is not expected to measure channel/interference on the CSI-RS/CSI-[M/SSB whose last OFDM symbol is received up to \( Z^{\prime} \) symbols before transmission time of the first OFDM symbol of the aperiodic CSI reporting.

A slot in a serving cell shall be considered to be a valid downlink slot if:
- it comprises at least one higher layer configured downlink or flexible symbol, and
- it does not fall within a configured measurement gap for that UE

If there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot \( n^{\prime} \).

After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.

When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When DRX is configured and the CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement corresponding to a CSI report is configured with two Resource Groups and \( N \) Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for each CSI-RS resource in a Resource Pair within the same DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI to report CSI with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to quantities other than 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-
Capability[Set]Index', and 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index ' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report CSI during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in Clause 5-2-1.4 if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-[M occasion for interference measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and if the UE configured by higher layer parameter ps-TransmitPeriodicL 1 -RSRP to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-
Capability[Set]Index', or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' when drx-onDurationTimer is not started, the UE shall report L1-RSRP during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside active time according to the procedure described in clause 5-2.1-4 and when reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP' or 'cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report otherwise.

When deriving CSI feedback, the UE is not expected that a NZP CSI -RS resource for channel measurement overlaps with CSI-IM resource for interference measurement or NZP CSI -RS resource for interference measurement.

If configured to report CQI index, in the CSI reference resource, the UE shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving the CQI index, and if also configured, for deriving PMI and RI :
- The first 2 OFDM symbols are occupied by control signaling.
- The number of PDSCH and DM-RS symbols is equal to 12 .
- The same bandwidth part subcarrier spacing configured as for the PDSCH reception
- The bandwidth as configured for the corresponding CQI report.
- The reference resource uses the CP length and subcarrier spacing configured for PDSCH reception
- No resource elements used by primary or secondary synchronization signals or PBCH.
- Redundancy Version 0 .
