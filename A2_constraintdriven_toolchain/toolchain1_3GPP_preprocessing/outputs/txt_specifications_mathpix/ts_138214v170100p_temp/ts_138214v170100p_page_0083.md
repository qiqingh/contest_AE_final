If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format as a valid activation or valid release of semi-persistent CSI transmission on PUSCH, and the UE activates or deactivates a CSI Reporting Setting indicated by CSI request field in the DCI. If validation is not achieved, the UE considers the DCI format as having been detected with a non-matching CRC.

If the UE has an active semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource configuration, or an active semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration, and has not received a deactivation command, the activated semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set or the activated semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configurations are considered to be active when the corresponding DL BWP is active, otherwise they are considered suspended.

If the UE is configured with carrier deactivation, the following configurations in the carrier in activated state would also be deactivated and need re-activation configuration(s): semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI- [M resource, semi-persistent CSI reporting on PUCCH, semi-persistent SRS, semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set.
5.2.1.5.3 Aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking for fast SCell activation

When the UE receives an Enhanced Scell Activation/Deactivation MAC-CE that triggers one or two CSI-RS bursts for fast SCell activation for a (set of) deactivated SCell(s),
- if the MAC-CE indicates that the first CSI-RS burst for SCell activation is present in an SCell, then the UE may assume that the first CSI-RS burst for SCell activation is present in that SCell. The first slot of the first CSI-RS burst starts at the \( m_{t}{ }^{\text {th }} \) SCell slot after the last SCell slot coinciding with the reference slot \( n+k \), as defined in clause 4.3 of [6, TS38.213], of the cell in which the MAC-CE was received.
- if the MAC-CE indicates that the second CSI-RS burst for SCell activation is present in an SCell, then the UE may assume that the second CSI-RS burst for SCell activation is present in that SCell. The first slot of the second CSI-RS burst starts at the \( m_{2}{ }^{\text {th }} \) SCell slot after the end of the first CSI-RS burst. The CSI-RS of the second burst shall have the same antenna port index, OFDM symbol allocations in a slot, same PRB allocation location as the CSI-RS of the first burst.
- Where the CSI-RS burst is defined as four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots in clause 5.1.6.1.1.1, and \( m_{1} \) and \( m_{2} \) are provided by the MAC-CE and higher layer configuration.
5.2.1.6 CSI processing criteria

The UE indicates the number of supported simultaneous CSI calculations \( N_{C P U} \) with parameter simultaneousCSIReportsPerCC in a component carrier, and simultaneousCSI-ReportsAllCC across all component carriers. If a UE supports \( N_{\text {CPU }} \) simultaneous CSI calculations it is said to have \( N_{\text {CPU }} \) CSI processing units for processing CSI reports. If \( L \) CPUs are occupied for calculation of CSI reports in a given OFDM symbol, the UE has \( N_{C P U}-L \) unoccupied CPUs. If \( N \) CSI reports start occupying their respective CPUs on the same OFDM symbol on which \( N_{\text {CPU }}-L \) CPUs are unoccupied, where each CSI report \( n=0, \ldots, N-1 \) corresponds to \( O_{C P U}^{(n)} \), the UE is not required to update the \( N-M \)
