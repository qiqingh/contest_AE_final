For any CSI-RS resource configuration, the UE shall assume that the value for parameter cdm-Type is 'noCDM', and there is only one antenna port.
5.1.6.2 DM-RS reception procedure

The DM-RS reception procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-1-2 and dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-1-2 instead of dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA and dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB.

The DM-RS reception procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 4 \_2 \), by applying the parameters of dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA and dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB in PDSCH-Config-Multicast instead of dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA and dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB in PDSCHConfig.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0,4 \_0 \), or \( 4 \_1 \), or receiving PDSCH before dedicated higher layer configuration of any of the parameters dmrs-AdditionalPosition, maxLength and dmrs-Type, the UE shall assume that the PDSCH is not present in any symbol carrying DM-RS except for PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols with PDSCH mapping type B (described in clause 7.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS 38.211]), and a single symbol front-loaded DM-RS of configuration type 1 on DM-RS port 1000 is transmitted, and that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE and in addition
- For PDSCH with mapping type A and type B , the UE shall assume dmrs-AdditionalPosition='pos2' and up to two additional single-symbol DM-RS present in a slot according to the PDSCH duration indicated in the DCI as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211], and
- For PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols with mapping type B , the UE shall assume that the PDSCH is present in the symbol carrying DM-RS.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 _ 1 by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI or DCI format 4 _ 2 by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI,
- the UE may be configured with the higher layer parameter dmrs-Type, and the configured DM-RS configuration type is used for receiving PDSCH in as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211].
- the UE may be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter maxLength given by DMRS-DownlinkConfig..
- if maxLength is set to 'len1', single-symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI, and the UE can be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PDSCH by higher layer parameter dmrsAdditionalPosition, which can be set to 'pos0', 'pos1', 'pos2' or 'pos3'.
- if maxLength is set to 'len2', both single-symbol DM-RS and double symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI, and the UE can be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PDSCH by higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition, which can be set to 'pos0' or 'pos1'.
- and the UE shall assume to receive additional DM-RS as specified in Table 7.4.1.1.2-3 and Table 7.4.1.1.2-4 as described in Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS 38.211].

For the UE-specific reference signals generation as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211], a UE can be configured by higher layers with one or two scrambling identity(s), \( n_{I D}^{D M R S_{1} i} i=0,1 \) which are the same for both PDSCH mapping Type A and Type B.

A UE may be scheduled with a number of DM-RS ports by the antenna port index in DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) as described in Clause 7.3.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212].

For DM-RS configuration type 1 ,
- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna port mapping with indices of \( \{2,9,10,11 \) or 30\} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-1 and Table 7.3.1.2.2-2 of Clause 7.3.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212], or
