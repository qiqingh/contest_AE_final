For an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2_3 and if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA', and given by SRS-CarrierSwitching, without PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the order of the triggered SRS transmission on the serving cells follow the order of the serving cells in the indicated set of serving cells configured by higher layers, where the UE in each serving cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s) from srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage set to 'antennaSwitching' and higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic'.

For an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2_3 and if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB' without PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the order of the triggered SRS transmission on the serving cells follow the order of the serving cells with aperiodic SRS triggered in the DCI, and the UE in each serving cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s) from srs-ResourceSetToAddModList with higher layer parameter usage set to 'antennaSwitching' and higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic'.

If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on carrier \( c_{1} \) with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on carrier \( c_{1} \) and serving cell \( c_{2} \), the UE is not expected to be configured or indicated with SRS resource(s) such that SRS transmission on carrier \( c_{\text {, }} \) (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) would collide with the REs corresponding to the SS/PBCH blocks configured for the UE or the slots belonging to a control resource set indicated by \( M I B \) or \( S I B I \) on serving cell \( c_{2} \).

For \( n \)-th ( \( n \geq 1 \) ) aperiodic SRS transmission on a cell \( c \), upon detection of a positive SRS request on a grant, the UE shall commence this SRS transmission on the configured symbol and slot provided
- it is no earlier than the summation of
- the maximum time duration between the two durations spanned by N OFDM symbols of the numerology of cell \( c \) and the cell carrying the grant respectively, and
- the UL or DL RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR,
- it does not collide with any previous SRS transmissions, or interruption due to UL or DL RF retuning time.
otherwise, \( n \)-th SRS transmission is dropped, where N is the reported capability as the minimum time interval in unit of symbols, between the DCI triggering and aperiodic SRS transmission.

In case of inter-band carrier aggregation, a UE can simultaneously transmit SRS and PUCCH/PUSCH across component carriers in different bands subject to the UE's capability.

In case of inter-band carrier aggregation, a UE can simultaneously transmit PRACH and SRS across component carriers in different bands subject to UE's capability.
6.2.1.4 UE sounding procedure for positioning purposes

When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter \( S R S \)-PosResource and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos is configured, it contains the ID of the configuration fields of a reference RS according to Clause 6.3.2 of [TS 38.331]. The reference RS can be an SRS configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource, CSI-RS, SS/PBCH block, or a DL PRS configured on a serving cell or a SS/PBCH block or a DL PRS configured on a non-serving cell. If the UE is configured for transmission of SRS-PosResource in RRC_INACTIVE mode, the configured spatialRelationInfoPos is also applicable.

The UE is not expected to transmit multiple SRS resources with different spatial relations in the same OFDM symbol.
If the UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos the UE may use a fixed spatial domain transmission filter for transmissions of the SRS configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource across multiple SRS resources or it may use a different spatial domain transmission filter across multiple SRS resources.

The UE is only expected to transmit an SRS configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource within the active UL BWP of the UE.

When the configuration of SRS is done by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource, the UE can only be provided with a single RS source in spatialRelationInfoPos per SRS resource for positioning.
