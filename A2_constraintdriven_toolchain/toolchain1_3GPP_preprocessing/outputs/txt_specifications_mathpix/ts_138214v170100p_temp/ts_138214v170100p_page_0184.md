SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same time. An SRS resource set has two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS port, and the SRS port of the second resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port than the SRS port of the first resource in the same set, and
- zero or one SRS resource set with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration], where in the case of one resource set, a total of two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of one slot and where the SRS port of the second resource in the given set is associated with a different UE antenna port than the SRS port of the first resource in the same set. In the case of two resource sets, a total of two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. The two sets are each configured with one SRS resource, or
- otherwise, for 1T2R, up to two SRS resource sets configured with a different value for the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set, where each set has two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS port, and the SRS port of the second resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port than the SRS port of the first resource in the same set, or
- For 2T4R, if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets] and/or a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration]:
- zero or one or two SRS resource sets configured with a different value for the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' or 'semi-persistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same time. Each SRS resource set has two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the second resource is associated with a different UE antenna port pair than the SRS port pair of the first resource, and,
- zero or one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration], where in the case of one resource set, a total of two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols in the same slot, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the second resource is associated with a different UE antenna port pair than the SRS port pair of the first resource. In the case of two resource sets, a total of two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port pair of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port pair. The two sets are each configured with one SRS resource, or
- otherwise, up to two SRS resource sets configured with a different value for the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet, where each SRS resource set has two SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the second resource is associated with a different UE antenna port pair than the SRS port pair of the first resource, or
- For 1T4R, if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets] and/or a capability for [extension of aperiodic antenna switching SRS configuration],
- zero or one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' or 'semipersistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same
