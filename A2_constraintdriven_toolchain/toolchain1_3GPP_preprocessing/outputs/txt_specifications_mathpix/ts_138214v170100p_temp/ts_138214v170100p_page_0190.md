For operation on the same carrier, if an SRS configured by the higher parameter \( S R S \)-PosResource collides with a scheduled PUSCH, the SRS is dropped in the symbols where the collision occurs.

The UE does not expect to be configured with \( S R S- \) PosResource on a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission.

The UE may be configured, subject to UE capability, to report UE TEGs (Timing Error Group), where the TEGs are:
- ueTXTEG which is associated with the transmissions of one or more UL SRS resources for the positioning purpose, which have the Tx timing error difference within a certain margin.

The UE may be configured to report, subject to UE capability, association information of SRS resource(s) configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource with UE Tx TEG(s) via higher layer parameter [ueTxTEG].

If the UE reports a UE Tx TEG ID with a UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, as defined in clause 5.1.6.5, the UE shall report the association information of SRS resources configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource with the UE Tx TEG ID.

If the UE is configured with SRS resources configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource in multiple CCs, the UE should report the [frequency information] of the SRS resources when it reports the UE Tx TEG associations.

If the UE reports a UE RxTx TEG ID with a UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, the UE may report a Tx TEG ID.
Subject to UE capability, the UE may be configured with an SRS resource for positioning associated with the initial UL BWP, and the SRS resource is transmitted inside the initial UL BWP during RRC_INACTIVE mode with the same CP and numerology as configured for the initial UL BWP. Subject to UE capability, the UE may be configured with an SRS resource for positioning including frequency location and bandwidth, numerology, and CP length for transmission of the SRS in RRC_INACTIVE mode. If the transmission of SRS for positioning in RRC_INACTIVE mode [with the switching time] [in unpaired spectrum], subject to UE capability, collides in time domain with other DL signals or channels or UL signals or channels, the SRS for positioning transmission is dropped in the symbol(s) where the collision occurs. The SRS resource for positioning in RRC_INACTIVE mode is configured in the same band and CC as the initial UL BWP.

If the UE in RRC_INACTIVE mode determines that the UE is not able to accurately measure the configured DL RS in SRS-SpatialRelationInfoPos for a SRS resource for positioning where the DL RS is semi-persistent or periodic, the UE stops transmission of the SRS resource for positioning
6.2.2 UE DM-RS transmission procedure

The DM-RS transmission procedures for PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) described in this clause equally apply to PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), by applying the parameters of dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-0-2 and dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-0-2 instead of dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA and dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB.

When transmitted PUSCH is neither scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 / 0 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, nor corresponding to a configured grant, nor being a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure, the UE shall use single symbol front-loaded DM-RS of configuration type 1 on DM-RS port 0 and the remaining REs not used for DM-RS in the symbols are not used for any PUSCH transmission except for PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM symbols with transform precoding disabled, additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to the scheduling type and the PUSCH duration as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3 of [4, TS38.211] for frequency hopping disabled and as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-6 of [4, TS38.211] for frequency hopping enabled, and

If frequency hopping is disabled:
- The UE shall assume dmrs-AdditionalPosition equals to 'pos2' and up to two additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to PUSCH duration, or

If frequency hopping is enabled:
- The UE shall assume dmrs-AdditionalPosition equals to 'pos1' and up to one additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to PUSCH duration.
