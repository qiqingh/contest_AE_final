- is not expected to decode PDSCH scheduled with broadcast G-RNTI and PBCH in Pcell that partially or fully overlaps in time in non-overlapping PRBs.

On a frequency range 1 cell, the UE shall be able to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CSRNTI and, during a process of P-RNTI triggered SI acquisition, another PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI that partially or fully overlap in time in non-overlapping PRBs, unless the PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CSRNTI requires Capability 2 processing time according to clause 5.3 in which case the UE may skip decoding of the scheduled PDSCH with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI.

On a frequency range 2 cell, the UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CSRNTI if in the same cell, during a process of P-RNTI triggered SI acquisition, another PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI partially or fully overlap in time.

The UE is expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI during a process of autonomous SI acquisition.

The maximum number of PDSCHs scheduled per slot per component carrier with C-RNTI/CS-RNTI and G-RNTI/G-CS-RNTI that the UE shall be able to decode is the same as the indicated UE capability for the number of unicast PDSCHs per slot per component carrier. If the UE is capable of receiving FDMed unicast and multicast PDSCH per slot per carrier, the UE shall be able to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI/CS-RNTI and a PDSCH scheduled with G-RNTI/G-CS-RNTI that partially or fully overlap in time in non-overlapping PRBs.

If the UE is configured by higher layers to decode a PDCCH with its CRC scrambled by a CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the UE shall receive PDSCH transmissions without corresponding PDCCH transmissions using the higher-layerprovided PDSCH configuration for those PDSCHs.

For UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes, it is not expected to support reception of FDMed MCCH PDSCH and MTCH PDSCH, or FDMed multiple MTCH PDSCHs, or FDMed MCCH/MTCH PDSCH and SIB PDSCH in Pcell that partially or fully overlap in time in non-overlapping PRBs.

If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex. For a ControlResourceSet without coresetPoollndex, the UE may assume that the ControlResourceSet is assigned with coresetPoollndex as 0 . When the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], ControlResourceSets corresponding to different coresetPoolIndex values may be associated with different physical cell [Ds via activated TCI states of the ControlResourceSets, where ControlResourceSets corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and ControlResourceSets corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, the following operations are allowed:
- For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol \( j \) by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol \( i \), the UE can be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol \( i \).
- In a given scheduled cell, the UE can receive a first PDSCH in slot \( i \), with the corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in slot \( j \), and a second PDSCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex different from that of the first PDSCH starting later than the first PDSCH with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in a slot before slot \( j \).

If PDCCH s that schedule corresponding PDSCH s are associated to the same or different ControlResourceSets having the same value of coresetPoollndex, the UE procedure for receiving the PDSCH upon detection of a PDCCH follows Clause 5.1.

A UE does not expect to be configured with repetitionScheme if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber for the same PDSCH.
