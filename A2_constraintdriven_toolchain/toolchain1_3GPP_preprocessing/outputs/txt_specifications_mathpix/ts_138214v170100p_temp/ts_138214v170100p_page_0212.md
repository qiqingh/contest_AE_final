'Time resource assignment' carries logical slot offset indication of \( \mathrm{N}=1 \) or 2 actual resources when \( s \) MaxNumPerReserve is 2, and N = 1 or 2 or 3 actual resources when sl-MaxNumPerReserve is 3 , in a form of time RIV (TRIV) field which is determined as follows:
```
if \( N=1 \)
    \( T R I V=0 \)
elseif \( N=2 \)
    TRIV \( =t_{1} \)
else
    if \( \left(t_{2}-t_{1}-1\right) \leq 15 \)
        TRIV \( =30\left(t_{2}-t_{1}-1\right)+t_{1}+31 \)
    else
        \( T R I V=30\left(31-t_{2}+t_{1}\right)+62-t_{1} \)
    end if
end if
```

where the first resource is in the slot where SCI format \( 1-\mathrm{A} \) was received, and \( t_{i} \) denotes \( i \)-th resource time offset in logical slots of a resource pool with respect to the first resource where for \( \mathrm{N}=2,1 \leq t_{1} \leq 31 \); and for \( \mathrm{N}=3,1 \leq t_{1} \leq 30, \mathrm{t}_{1}<t_{2} \leq 31 \).

The starting sub-channel \( n_{\text {sub } \mathrm{CH}, 0}^{\text {start }} \) of the first resource is determined according to clause 8.1.2.2. The number of contiguously allocated sub-channels for each of the N resources \( L_{\text {subcH }} \geq 1 \) and the starting sub-channel indexes of resources indicated by the received SCI format 1-A, except the resource in the slot where SCI format 1-A was received, are determined from "Frequency resource assignment" which is equal to a frequency RIV (FRIV) where.

If sl-MaxNumPerReserve is 2 then
\[
F R I V=n_{\text {subCH }, 1}^{\text {start }}+\sum_{i=1}^{L_{\text {subCH- }}-1}\left(N_{\text {subchannel }}^{S L}+1-i\right)
\]

If sl-MaxNumPerReserve is 3 then
\[
F R I V=n_{\text {subCH }, 1}^{\text {start }}+n_{\text {subCH }, 2}^{\text {start }} \cdot\left(N_{\text {subchannel }}^{S L}+1-L_{\text {subCH }}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{L_{\text {subCH-1 }}}\left(N_{\text {subchannel }}^{S L}+1-i\right)^{2}
\]
where
- \( n_{\text {subCH }, 1}^{\text {start }} \) denotes the starting sub-channel index for the second resource
- \( n_{\text {sub } \mathrm{CH}_{1} 2}^{\text {start }} \) denotes the starting sub-channel index for the third resource
- \( \quad N_{\text {subchamet }}^{S L} \) is the number of sub-channels in a resource pool provided according to the higher layer parameter \( s / \) NumSubchannel

If TRIV indicates \( N<s l \)-MaxNumPerReserve, the starting sub-channel indexes corresponding to sl-MaxNumPerReserve minus N last resources are not used.

The number of slots in one set of the time and frequency resources for transmission opportunities of PSSCH is given by \( C_{\text {resel }} \) where \( C_{\text {resel }}=10^{*} \) SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER \( [10 \), TS 38.321\( ] \) if configured else \( C_{\text {resel }} \) is set to 1 .

If a set of sub-channels in slot \( t^{\prime S L} \) is determined as the time and frequency resource for PSSCH transmission corresponding to the selected sidelink grant (described in [10, TS 38.321]), the same set of sub-channels in slots \( t_{m+j \times P_{r s v p_{-} T X}^{\prime}}^{\prime S L} \) are also determined for PSSCH transmissions corresponding to the same sidelink grant where \( j=1,2, \ldots \), \( C_{\text {resel }}-1, P_{\text {rsvp_TX }} \), if provided, is converted from units of msec to units of logical slots, resulting in \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }}^{\prime} \) according
