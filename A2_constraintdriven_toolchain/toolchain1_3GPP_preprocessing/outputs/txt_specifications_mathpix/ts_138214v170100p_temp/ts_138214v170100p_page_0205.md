A UE is not expected to receive an SCI indicating \( 28 \leq I_{M C S} \leq 31 \) if Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used, or \( 29 \leq I_{M C S} \leq 31 \) otherwise.
8.1.4 UE procedure for determining the subset of resources to be reported to higher layers in PSSCH resource selection in sidelink resource allocation mode 2

In resource allocation mode 2 , the higher layer can request the UE to determine a subset of resources from which the higher layer will select resources for PSSCH/PSCCH transmission. To trigger this procedure, in slot \( n \), the higher layer provides the following parameters for this PSSCH/PSCCH transmission:
- the resource pool from which the resources are to be reported;
- L1 priority, prio \( { }_{T X} \);
- the remaining packet delay budget;
- the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH transmission in a slot, \( L_{\text {subcH; }} \)
- optionally, the resource reservation interval, \( P_{\mathrm{rsvp} \_\mathrm{TX}} \), in units of msec.
- if the higher layer requests the UE to determine a subset of resources from which the higher layer will select resources for PSSCH/PSCCH transmission as part of re-evaluation or pre-emption procedure, the higher layer provides a set of resources \( \left(r_{0}, r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots\right) \) which may be subject to re-evaluation and a set of resources \( \left(r_{0}^{\prime}, r_{1}^{\prime}, r_{2}^{\prime}, \ldots\right) \) which may be subject to pre-emption.
- it is up to UE implementation to determine the subset of resources as requested by higher layers before or after the slot \( r_{i}^{\prime \prime}-T_{3} \), where \( r_{i}^{\prime \prime} \) is the slot with the smallest slot index among \( \left(r_{0}, r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots\right) \) and \( \left(r_{0}^{\prime}, r_{1}^{\prime}, r_{2}^{\prime}, \ldots\right) \), and \( T_{3} \) is equal to \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \), where \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \) is defined in slots in Table 8.1.4-2 where \( \mu_{S L} \) is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP.
- Optionally, the indication of resource selection mechanism(s), as allowedResourceSelectionConfig, which may comprise of full sensing only, partial sensing only, random resource selection only, or any combination(s) thereof.

The following higher layer parameters affect this procedure:
- sl-SelectionWindowList: internal parameter \( T_{2 m i n} \) is set to the corresponding value from higher layer parameter sl-SelectionWindowList for the given value of prio \( { }_{T X} \) -
- sl-Thres-RSRP-List: this higher layer parameter provides an RSRP threshold for each combination \( \left(p_{i}, p_{j}\right) \), where \( p_{i} \) is the value of the priority field in a received \( S C I \) format \( 1-A \) and \( p_{\mathrm{j}} \) is the priority of the transmission of the UE selecting resources; for a given invocation of this procedure, \( p_{\mathrm{j}}=\operatorname{prio}_{T X} \) -
- sl-RS-ForSensing selects if the UE uses the PSSCH-RSRP or PSCCH-RSRP measurement, as defined in clause 8.4.2.1
- sl-ResourceReservePeriodList
- sl-SensingWindow: internal parameter \( T_{0} \) is defined as the number of slots corresponding to sl-SensingWindow msec
- sl-TxPercentageList: internal parameter \( X \) for a given prio \( _{T X} \) is defined as sl-TxPercentageList (prio \( { }_{T X} \) ) converted from percentage to ratio
- sl-PreemptionEnable: if sl-PreemptionEnable is provided, and if it is not equal to 'enabled', internal parameter prio \( o_{p r} \) is set to the higher layer provided parameter sl-PreemptionEnable.
- Optionally, minimum number of \( Y \) slots as \( Y \) min (minNumCandidateSlotsPeriodic), which indicates the minimum number of \( Y \) slots that are included in the resources corresponding to periodic-based partial sensing.
