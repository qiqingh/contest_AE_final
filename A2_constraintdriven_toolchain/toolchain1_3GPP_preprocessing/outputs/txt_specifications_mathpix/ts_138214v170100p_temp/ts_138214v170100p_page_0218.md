ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- Assume sidelink CSI-RS RE power is the same as PSSCH RE power.
- The PSSCH transmission scheme where the UE may assume that PSSCH transmission would be performed with up to 2 transmission layers as defined in Clause 8.3.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. For CQI calculation, the UE should assume that PSSCH signals on antenna ports in the set \( [1000, \ldots, 1000+\mathrm{v}-1] \) for v layers would result in signals equivalent to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \( [3000, \ldots, 3000+P-1] \), as given by
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{(3000)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
y^{(3000+P-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]=W(i)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x^{(0)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
x^{(v-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \( x(i)=\left[x^{(0)}(i) \ldots x^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{T} \) is a vector of PSSCH symbols from the layer mapping defined in Clause 8.3.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], \( P \in[1,2] \) is the number of CSI-RS ports. If only one CSI-RS port is configured, \( W(i) \) is 1 . Otherwise, \( W(i) \) is the identity matrix.
8.5.3 CSI reporting

The UE can be configured with one CSI reporting latency bound as indicated by the higher layer parameter sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report. CSI reporting is aperiodic and is described in [10, TS 38.321].
8.6 UE PSSCH preparation procedure time

For sidelink dynamic grant and for SL configured grant type 2 activation, if the first sidelink symbol in the sidelink allocation for a PSSCH for a transport block and the associated PSCCH, including the DM-RS and the duplicated symbol, as defined by the slot offset \( K_{S L} \) of the scheduling DCI for dynamic grant or the activating DCI for SL configured grant type 2, is no earlier than at symbol \( L \), where \( L \) is defined as the next sidelink symbol with its CP starting \( T_{\text {proc }}=\left(N_{2}+d_{2,1}\right)(2048+144) \cdot \kappa 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{C} \) after the end of the reception of the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the sidelink transmissions for dynamic grant or activating the SL configured grant type 2, then the UE shall transmit the PSSCH and the associated PSCCH.
- \( \quad N_{2} \) is based on \( \mu \) of Table 8.6-1, where \( \mu \) corresponds to the one of \( \left(\mu_{D L}, \mu_{S L}\right) \) resulting with the largest \( T_{\text {proc, }} \) where the \( \mu_{D L} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the downlink with which the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PSSCH for dynamic grant or activating the SL configured grant type 2 was transmitted and \( \mu_{S L} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the sidelink channel with which the PSSCH and the associated PSCCH are to be transmitted, and \( \kappa \) is defined in Clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211].
- \( d_{2, /}=1 \).

Otherwise the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI for dynamic grant or the activating DCI for SL configured grant type 2.

The value of \( T_{p r o c} \) is used both in the case of normal and extended cyclic prefix.

\caption{Table 8.6-1: PSSCH preparation time}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline\( \mu \) & PSSCH preparation time \( N_{2} \) [symbols] \\
\hline 0 & 10 \\
\hline 1 & 12 \\
\hline 2 & 23 \\
\hline 3 & 36 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For sidelink resource allocation mode 1, the UE does not expect that the first sidelink symbol in the sidelink allocation for a PSSCH for retransmission of a transport block and the associated PSCCH, including the DM-RS and the duplicated symbol as defined by the "Time resource assignment" field of the corresponding DCI for dynamic grant or for SL configured grant type 2, or by sl-TimeResourceCG-Typel for configured grant type 1 starts earlier than at symbol \( L \) where \( L \) is defined as the next sidelink symbol with its CP starting \( T_{p r e p}+\delta \) after the end of the last symbol of the PSFCH occasion corresponding to the most recent transmission of PSSCH for the same transport block, where \( T_{\text {prep }} \) is defined in Clause 16.5 of [6, TS 38.213] and \( \delta=5 \cdot 10^{-4} s \). Otherwise the UE may skip the retransmission of the PSSCH and the transmsission of the corresponding PSCCH.
