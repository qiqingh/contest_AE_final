'off', the initial transmission of a transport block may only start at the first transmission occasion of the \( K \) repetitions. Otherwise, the initial transmission of a transport block may start at
- the first transmission occasion of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,2,3,1\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions that are associated with \( \mathrm{RV}=0 \) if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,3,0,3\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,0,0,0\} \), except the last transmission occasion when \( K \geq 8 \).

When the transmission occasions are associated with the first and second SRS resource sets, if the parameter rep \( K-R V \) is provided in the configuredGrantConfig, for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among all transmission occasions that are associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion, it is associated with \( (\bmod (n-1,4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the configured RV sequence, and for the \( n \)th transmission occasion among all transmission occasions that are not associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion, it is associated with \( (m o d(n-1,4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the adjusted RV sequence and the adjustment is based on additional shifting operation on the configured RV sequence, where the shifting operation is defined as \( \left(r v_{i}+r v_{s}\right) \bmod 4 \) where \( r v_{i} \) is the \( i^{t h} \mathrm{RV} \) value \( (i=1,2,3,4) \) in the configured RV sequence and \( r v_{s} \) is configured by the higher layer parameter sequenceOffsetforR \( V \) in configured GrantConfig. When the transmission occasions are associated with the first and second SRS resource sets, if a configured grant configuration is configured with startingFromRVO set to 'off', the initial transmission of a transport block may only start at the first transmission occasion of the \( K \) repetitions. Otherwise, the initial transmission of a transport block may start at
- the first transmission occasion associated with \( \mathrm{RV}=0 \) corresponding to the first or second SRS resource set of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,2,3,1\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions that are associated with \( \mathrm{RV}=0 \) if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,3,0,3\} \),
- any of the transmission occasions of the \( K \) repetitions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,0,0,0\} \), except the last transmission occasion when \( K \geq 8 \).

After the initial transmission of a transport block, later transmission occasions among the \( K \) repetitions associated with any RV value and associated to any of the first or second SRS resource set can be used for transmitting the transport block.

For any RV sequence, the repetitions shall be terminated after transmitting \( K \) repetitions, or at the last transmission occasion among the \( K \) repetitions within the period \( P \), or from the starting symbol of the repetition that overlaps with a PUSCH with the same HARQ process scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0,0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), whichever is reached first. In addition, the UE shall terminate the repetition of a transport block in a PUSCH transmission if the UE receives a DCI format 0_1 with DFI flag provided and set to ' 1 ', and if in this DCI the UE detects ACK for the HARQ process corresponding to that transport block.

The UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the transmission of \( K \) repetitions larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity \( P \). If the UE determines that, for a transmission occasion, the number of symbols available for the PUSCH transmission in a slot is smaller than transmission duration \( L \), the UE does not transmit the PUSCH in the transmission occasion.

For both Type 1 and Type 2 PUSCH transmissions with a configured grant, when \( K>1 \),
- For unpaired spectrum:
- If AvailableSlotCounting is enabled, the UE shall repeat the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission applying the same symbol allocation in each slot.
- A slot is not counted in the number of \( N \cdot K \) slots if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by \( t d d-U L-D L- \) ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst.
- Otherwise, the UE shall repeat the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, except if the UE is provided with higher layer parameters cg-nrofSlots and cg-nrofPUSCHInSlot, in which case the UE repeats the TB in the repK earliest consecutive transmission occasion candidates within the same configuration.
