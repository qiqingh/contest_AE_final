6.1.5.2 UE procedure for transmitting code block group based transmissions

If a UE is configured to transmit code block group-based transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter codeBlockGroupTransmission in PUSCH-ServingCellConfig,
- For an initial transmission of a TB as indicated by the 'New Data Indicator' field of the scheduling DCI, the UE may expect that the CBGTI field indicates all the CBGs of the TB are to be transmitted, and the UE shall include all the code block groups of the TB.
- For a retransmission of a TB as indicated by the 'New Data Indicator' field of the scheduling DCI, the UE shall include only the CBGs indicated by the CBGTI field of the scheduling DCI.

A bit value of ' 0 ' in the CBGTI field indicates that the corresponding CBG is not to be transmitted and ' 1 ' indicates that it is to be transmitted. The order of CBGTI field bits is such that the CBGs are mapped in order from CBG\#0 onwards starting from the MSB.
6.1.6 Uplink switching

The UE may omit uplink transmission during the uplink switching gap \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) if the conditions defined in this clause are met and the UE is configured with uplinkTxSwitching. The switching gap \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) is indicated by UE capability uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod2T2T if uplinkTxSwitching-2T-Mode is configured, and uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod otherwise:
- If a UE indicated a capability for uplink switching with BandCombination-UplinkTxSwitch for a band combination, and if it is for that band combination
- Configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a SCG using NR radio access (EN-DC), or
- Configured with uplink carrier aggregation, or
- Configured in a serving cell with two uplink carriers with higher layer parameter supplementaryUplink. the conditions under which the switching gap may be present and the location of the switching gap are defined for each of the cases in clauses 6.1.6.1, 6.1.6.2, and 6.1.6.3 respectively.

If an uplink switching is triggered for an uplink transmission starting at \( T_{0} \), after \( T_{0}-T_{o f f s e t} \), the UE is not expected to cancel the uplink switching, or to trigger any other new uplink switching occurring before \( T_{0} \) for any other uplink transmission that is scheduled after \( T_{0}-T_{o f f e r} \), where \( T_{o f f e r} \) is the UE processing procedure time defined for the uplink transmission triggering the switch given in clause 5.3, clause 5.4, clause 6.2.1, clause 6.4 and in clause 9 of [6, TS 38.213].

The UE does not expect to perform more than one uplink switching in a slot with \( \mu_{U L}=\max \left(\mu_{U L,}, \mu_{U,} 2\right) \), where the \( \mu_{u l} \), corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the active UL BWP of one uplink carrier before the switching gap and the \( \mu_{U L, 2} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the active UL BWP of the other uplink carrier after the switching gap.
6.1.6.1 Uplink switching for EN-DC

For a UE indicating a capability for uplink switching with BandCombination-UplinkTxSwitch for a band combination, and if it is for that band combination configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a SCG using NR radio access (EN-DC), if the UE is configured with uplink switching with parameter uplinkTxSwitching,
- for the UE configured with switchedUL by the parameter uplinkTxSwitchingOption, when the UE is to transmit in the uplink based on \( \mathrm{DCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) received before \( \boldsymbol{T}_{0}-\boldsymbol{T}_{\text {off set }} \) or based on a higher layer configuration(s):
- when the UE is to transmit an NR uplink that takes place after an E-UTRA uplink on another uplink carrier then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the two carriers.
- when the UE is to transmit an E-UTRA uplink that takes place after an NR uplink on another uplink carrier then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the two carriers.
- the UE is not expected to transmit simultaneously on the NR uplink and the E-UTRA uplink. If the UE is scheduled or configured to transmit any NR uplink transmission overlapping with an E-UTRA uplink transmission, the NR uplink transmission is dropped,
