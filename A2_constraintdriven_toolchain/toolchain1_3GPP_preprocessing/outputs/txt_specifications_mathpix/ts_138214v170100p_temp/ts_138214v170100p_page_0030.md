ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- TBS \( _{\text {LBRM }} \) as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
- X as defined for downlink in Clause 5.4.2.1 [5, TS 38.212].

If the UE skips decoding, the physical layer indicates to higher layer that the transport block is not successfully decoded.

Within a cell group, a UE is not required to handle \( \mathrm{PDSCH}(s) \) transmissions in slot \( s_{j} \) in serving cell- \( j \), and for \( j=0,1,2 \ldots J-1 \), slot \( s_{j} \) overlapping with any given point in time, if the following condition is not satisfied at that point in time:
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \frac{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} V_{j, m}}{T_{\text {slot }}^{\mu(j)}} \leq \text { DataRate }
\]
where,
- J is the number of configured serving cells belonging to a frequency range
- for the \( j \)-th serving cell,
- \( M \) is the number of TB(s) transmitted in slot \( s_{j} \). If there are two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB (in time domain or in frequency domain) in the slot \( s_{j} \), each transmission occasion is counted separately.
- \( T_{\text {slop }}{ }^{\mu(j)}=10^{-3} / 2^{\mu(j)} \), where \( \mu(j) \) is the numerology for PDSCH(s) in slot \( s_{j} \) of the \( j \)-th serving cell.
- for the \( m \)-th TB, \( V_{j, m}=C^{\prime} \cdot\left\lfloor\frac{A}{c}\right\rfloor \)
- \( A \) is the number of bits in the transport block as defined in Clause 7.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
- \( C \) is the total number of code blocks for the transport block defined in Clause 5.2 .2 [5, TS 38.212].
- \( \quad C^{\prime} \) is the number of scheduled code blocks for the transport block as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
- DataRate [Mbps] is computed as the maximum data rate summed over all the carriers in the frequency range for any signaled band combination and feature set consistent with the configured servings cells, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2 in [13, TS 38.306], including the scaling factor \( f(i) \).

For a \( j \)-th serving cell, if higher layer parameter processingType2Enabled of PDSCH-ServingCellConfig is configured for the serving cell and set to 'enable', or if at least one \( I_{M C S}>W \) for a PDSCH, where \( W=28 \) for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-1 and 5.1.3.1-3, and \( W=27 \) for MCS table 5.1.3.1-2, and \( W=26 \) for MCS table 5.1.3.1-4, the UE is not required to handle PDSCH transmissions, if the following condition is not satisfied:
\[
\frac{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} V_{j, m}}{L \times T_{s}^{\mu}} \leq \text { DataRateCC }
\]
where
- \( L \) is the number of symbols assigned to the PDSCH. For a PDSCH that consists of two PDSCH transmission occasions in time domain in one slot, \( L \) is the number of symbols of one transmission occasion.
- M is the number of \( \mathrm{TB}(\mathrm{s}) \) in the PDSCH
- \( T_{s}^{\mu}=\frac{10^{-3}}{2^{\mu} \cdot N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }}} \) where \( \mu \) is the numerology of the PDSCH
- for the \( m \)-th TB, \( V_{j, m}=C^{\prime} \cdot\left\lfloor\frac{A}{c}\right\rfloor \)
- \( A \) is the number of bits in the transport block as defined in Clause 7.2 .1 [5, TS 38.212]
- \( C \) is the total number of code blocks for the transport block defined in Clause 5.2 .2 [5, TS 38.212]
- \( C^{\prime} \) is the number of scheduled code blocks for the transport block as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 [5, TS 38.212]
