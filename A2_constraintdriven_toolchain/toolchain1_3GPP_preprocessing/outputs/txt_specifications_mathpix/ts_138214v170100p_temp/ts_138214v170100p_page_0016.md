expect that the sfnSchemePdsch and/or sfnSchemePdcch configuration are the same in all CCs in a same frequency band if the UE is configured with CA.

If more than one PDSCH on a serving cell each without a corresponding PDCCH transmission are in a slot, after resolving overlapping with symbols in the slot indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, a UE receives one or more PDSCHs without corresponding PDCCH transmissions in the slot as specified below.
- Step 0: set \( j=0 \), where \( j \) is the number of selected \( \operatorname{PDSCH}(s) \) for decoding. \( Q \) is the set of activated PDSCHs without corresponding PDCCH transmissions within the slot
- Step 1: A UE receives one PDSCH with the lowest configured sps-ConfigInder within \( Q \), set \( j=j+1 \). Designate the received PDSCH as survivor PDSCH .
- Step 2: The survivor PDSCH in step 1 and any other PDSCH(s) overlapping (even partially) with the survivor PDSCH in step 1 are excluded from \( Q \).
- Step 3: Repeat step 1 and 2 until \( Q \) is empty or \( j \) is equal to the number of unicast/multicast PDSCHs in a slot supported by the UE
5.1.1 Transmission schemes

Only one transmission scheme is defined for the PDSCH, and is used for all PDSCH transmissions.
5.1.1.1 Transmission scheme 1

For transmission scheme 1 of the PDSCH, the UE may assume that a gNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed with up to 8 transmission layers on antenna ports 1000-1011 as defined in Clause 7.3 .1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], subject to the DM-RS reception procedures in Clause 5.1.6.2.
5.1.2 Resource allocation
5.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain

When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the Time domain resource assignment field value \( m \) of the DCI provides a row index \( m+1 \) to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource allocation table is defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot offset \( K_{0} \), the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \( S \) and the allocation length \( L \), and the PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.

Given the parameter values of the indexed row:
- The slot allocated for the PDSCH is \( K_{s} \), where
\[
K_{S}=\left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu P O S C H}}{2^{\mu P O C C H}}\right\rfloor+K_{0}+\left\lfloor\left(\frac{N_{\text {slol offsel PDCCH }}^{C A}}{2^{\mu \mathrm{afset}, P D C C H}}-\frac{N_{\text {slot }, \text { offsel }, P D S C H}^{C A}}{2^{\mu \mathrm{afset}, P D S C H}}\right) \cdot 2^{\mu \mathrm{PDSCH}}\right\rfloor \text {, if UE is configured with } c a \text { - }
\]

SlotOffset for at least one of the scheduled and scheduling cell, and \( K_{s}=\left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu \mathrm{POSCN}}}{2^{\mu \mathrm{POCCH}}}\right\rfloor+K_{0} \), otherwise, and where \( n \) is the slot with the scheduling DCI, and \( K_{0} \) is based on the numerology of PDSCH, and \( \mu_{\text {PDSCH }} \) and \( \mu_{\text {PLCCH }} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for PDSCH and PDCCH, respectively, and
- \( \quad N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higherlayer configured ca-SlotOffset, for the cell receiving the PDCCH respectively, \( N_{\text {slot, offset, PDSCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PDSCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDSCH, as defined in clause 4.5 of [4, TS 38.211].
- The reference point \( S_{0} \) for starting symbol \( S \) is defined as:
- if configured with referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2, and when receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1 2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI with \( K_{0}=0 \), and PDSCH mapping Type B, the starting
