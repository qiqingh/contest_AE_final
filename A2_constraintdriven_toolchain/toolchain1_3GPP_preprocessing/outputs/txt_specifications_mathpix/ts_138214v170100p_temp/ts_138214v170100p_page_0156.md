6.1.2.2.3 Uplink resource allocation type 2

In uplink resource allocation of type 2, the resource block assignment information defined in [5, TS 38.212] indicates to a UE a set of up to \( M \) interlace indices, and for DCI \( 0 \_0 \) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1 a set of up to \( N_{\text {RB-set, UL }}^{\mathrm{BWP}} \) contiguous RB sets, where \( M \) and interlace indexing are defined in Clause 4.4.4.6 in [4, TS 38.211].
Within the active UL BWP, the assigned physical resource block \( n \) is mapped to virtual resource block \( n \). For DCI \( 0 \_0 \) monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0_1, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and the union of the indicated set of RB sets and intra-cell guard bands defined in Clause 7 between the indicated RB sets, if any. For DCI 00 monitored in a common search space, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and a single uplink RB set of the active UL BWP. For DCI \( 0 \_0 \) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the lowest indexed one amongst uplink RB set(s) that intersects the lowest-indexed CCE of the PDCCH in which the UE detects the DCI \( 0 \_0 \) in the active downlink BWP . When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the uplink RB set of a PUSCH when scheduled by DCI \( 0 \_0 \) monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than TC-RNTI, the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used. If there is no intersection, the uplink RB set is RB set 0 in the active uplink BWP. For DCI \( 0-0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the same one in which the UE transmits the PRACH associated with the RAR UL grant, in which case the UE assumes that the uplink RB set is defined as when the UE is not configured with intraCellGuardBandsUL-List (see Clause 7).

For \( \mu=0 \), the \( X=6 \) MSBs of the resource block assignment information indicates to a UE a set of allocated interlace indices \( m_{0}+l \), where the indication consists of a resource indication value ( \( R I V \) ). For \( 0 \leq R I V<M(M+1) / 2 \), \( l= 0,1, \cdots L-1 \) the resource indication value corresponds to the starting interlace index \( m_{0} \) and the number of contiguous interlace indices \( L(L \geq 1) \). The resource indication value is defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text { if } \begin{aligned}
(L-1) & \leq\lfloor M / 2\rfloor \text { then } \\
\qquad R I V & =M(L-1)+m_{0}
\end{aligned}
\end{array}
\]
else
\[
R I V=M(M-L+1)+\left(M-1-m_{0}\right)
\]

For \( R I V \geq M(M+1) / 2 \), the resource indication value corresponds to the starting interlace index \( m_{0} \) and the set of values \( l \) according to Table 6.1.2.2.3-1.
