expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that overlap those of the CORESET in the OFDM symbols occupied by the search space set(s).

The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and SIBI message in the overlapping PRBs in the OFDM symbols where SIB1 is transmitted.

If the UE is configured with DRX,
- if the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2 _ 6 and configured by higher layer parameter \( p s \) TransmitOtherPeriodic CSI to report CSI with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to quantities other than 'cri-RSRP' and 'ssb-Index-RSRP' when drx-onDurationTimer in DRXConfig is not started, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active time or during the time duration indicated by drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside DRX active time for CSI to be reported;
- if the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 26 and configured by higher layer parameter \( p s \) -TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter reportConfigType set to 'periodic' and reportQuantity set to cri-RSRP when drx-onDurationTimer in DRX-Config is not started, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active time or during the time duration indicated by \( d r x \) onDurationTimer in DRX-Config also outside DRX active time for CSI to be reported;
- otherwise, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active time for CSI to be reported.
5.1.6.1.1 CSI-RS for tracking

A UE in RRC connected mode is expected to receive the higher layer UE specific configuration of a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info.

For a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter trs-Info, the UE shall assume the antenna port with the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is the same.
- For frequency range 1 , the UE may be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS set(s), where a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet consists of four periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in each slot. If no two consecutive slots are indicated as downlink slots by \( t d d-U L-D L- \) Configuration Common or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated, then the UE may be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS set(s), where a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet consists of two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in one slot.
- For frequency range 2 the UE may be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS set(s), where a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet consists of two periodic CS[-RS resources in one slot or with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet of four periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in each slot.

A UE configured with NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s) configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info may have the CSIRS resources configured as:
- Periodic, with the CSI-RS resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with same periodicity, band width and subcarrier location.
- Periodic CSI-RS resource in one set and aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a second set, with the aperiodic CSI-RS and periodic CSI-RS resource having the same bandwidth (with same RB location) and the aperiodic CSI-RS being configured with qcl-Type set to 'type A' and 'typeD', where applicable, with the periodic CSI-RS resources. For frequency range 2, the UE does not expect that the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources is smaller than beamSwitchTiming \( +d \cdot 2^{\mu \text { CSIRS }} / 2^{\mu \text { PDCCH }} \) in CSI-RS symbols, where beamSwitchTiming is UE reported value defined in [13, TS 38.306], the reported value is one of the values of \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{C S I R S}-3\right)} \), and the beam switching timing delay \( d \) is defined in Table 5.2.1.5.1a-1 if \( \mu_{P D C C H}<\mu_{C S I R S} \), else \( d \) is zero. The UE shall expect that the periodic CSI-RS resource set and aperiodic CSI-RS resource set are configured with the same number of CSI-RS resources and with the same number of CSI-RS resources in a slot. For the aperiodic CSI-RS resource set if triggered, and if the associated periodic CSI-RS resource set is configured with four periodic CSIRS resources with two consecutive slots with two periodic CSI-RS resources in each slot, the higher layer parameter aperiodicTriggeringOffset indicates the triggering offset for the first slot for the first two CSI-RS resources in the set.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig that is linked to a CSI-ResourceConfig containing an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with trs-Info and with the CSI-ReportConfig configured with the higher layer parameter timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements set to 'configured'.
