5.2.1.3 (void)
5.2.1.4 Reporting configurations

The UE shall calculate CSI parameters (if reported) assuming the following dependencies between CSI parameters (if reported)
- LI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported CQI, PMI, RI and CRI
- CQI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported PMI, RI and CRI
- PMI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported RI and CRI
- RI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported CRI.

The Reporting configuration for CSI can be aperiodic (using PUSCH), periodic (using PUCCH) or semi-persistent (using PUCCH, and DCI activated PUSCH). The CSI-RS Resources can be periodic, semi-persistent, or aperiodic. Table 5.2.1.4-1 shows the supported combinations of CSI Reporting configurations and CSI-RS Resource configurations and how the CSI Reporting is triggered for each CSI-RS Resource configuration. Periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layers. Semi-persistent CSI-RS is activated and deactivated as described in Clause 5.2.1.5.2. Aperiodic CSI-RS is configured and triggered/activated as described in Clause 5.2.1.5.1.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline CSI-RS Configuration & Periodic CSI Reporting & Semi-Persistent CSI Reporting & Aperiodic CSI Reporting \\
\hline Periodic CSI-RS & No dynamic triggering/activation & For reporting on PUCCH, the UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321]; for reporting on PUSCH, the UE receives triggering on DCl & Triggered by DCI; additionally, subselection indication as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of [10, TS 38.321] possible as defined in Clause 5.2.1.5.1. \\
\hline Semi-Persistent CSI-RS & Not Supported & For reporting on PUCCH, the UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321]; for reporting on PUSCH, the UE receives triggering on DCl & Triggered by DCI; additionally, subselection indication as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of [10, TS 38.321] possible as defined in Clause 5.2.1.5.1. \\
\hline Aperiodic CSI-RS & Not Supported & Not Supported & Triggered by DCI; additionally, subselection indication as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of [10, TS 38.321] possible as defined in Clause 5.2.1.5.1. \\

When the UE is configured with higher layer parameter NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet and when the higher layer parameter repetition is set to 'off', the UE shall determine a CRI from the supported set of CRI values as defined in Clause 6.3.1.1.2 of [5, TS 38.212] and report the number in each CRI report. When the higher layer parameter repetition is set to 'on', CRI is not reported. CRI reporting is not supported when the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'type[I', 'type[I-PortSelection', 'type[I-r16', to 'type[I-PortSelection-r16', or 'type[I-PortSelection-r17'.

For a periodic or semi-persistent CSI report on PUCCH, the periodicity \( T_{C S I} \) (measured in slots) and the slot offset \( T_{\text {offset }} \) are configured by the higher layer parameter reportSlotConfig. Unless specified otherwise, the UE shall transmit the CSI report in frames with SFN \( n_{f} \) and slot number within the frame \( n_{s, f}^{\mu} \) satisfying
\[
\left(N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu} n_{f}+n_{s_{1} f}^{\mu}-T_{\text {offset }}\right) \bmod \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{CSI}}=0
\]
where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration of the UL BWP the CSI report is transmitted on.
