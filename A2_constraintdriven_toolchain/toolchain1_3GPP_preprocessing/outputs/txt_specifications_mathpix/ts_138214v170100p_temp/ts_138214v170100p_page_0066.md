5.2.1.2 Resource settings

Each CSI Resource Setting CSI-ResourceConfig contains a configuration of a list of S \( \geq 1 \) CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter csi-RS-ResourceSetList), where the list is comprised of references to either or both of NZP CSIRS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or the list is comprised of references to CSI-[M resource set(s). Each CSI Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer parameter BWP-id, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting have the same DL BWP.

The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter resourceType and can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, when the UE is configured with groupBasedBeamReporting-r17, the number of CS[ Resource Sets configured is \( S=2 \), otherwise the number of CSI-RS Resource Sets configured is limited to \( S=1 \). For periodic and semipersistent CSI Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by BWP-id. When a UE is configured with multiple CS/-ResourceConfigs consisting the same NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. When a UE is configured with multiple CSI-ResourceConfigs consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID, the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the CSI-ResourceConfigs. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.

The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement:
- CSI-[Mresource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.4.
- NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1.
- NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement as described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1.

The UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for channel measurement and the CSI-[M resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'. When NZP CSI-RS resource(s) is used for interference measurement, the UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and the CSI- [M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are QCLed with respect to 'typeD'.

For L1-SINR measurement:
- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements.
- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement on SSB or NZP CSI-RS and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-/M-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter \( n z p-C S I-R S \) ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-[M or on 1 port NZP CSI-RS with density 3 REs/RB, where each SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is associated with one CSI-[M resource or one NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement by the ordering of the SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement and CSI-[M resource or NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement in the corresponding resource sets. The number of SSB(s) or CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-[Mresources or the number of NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement.
- UE may apply the SSB, or 'typeD' RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' to the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, as the reference RS for determining 'typeD' assumption for the corresponding CSI[M resource or the corresponding NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting.
- UE may expect that the NZP CSI-RS resource set for channel measurement and the NZP-CSI-RS resource set for interference measurement, if any, are configured with the higher layer parameter repetition.
