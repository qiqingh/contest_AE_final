ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

When transmitted PUSCH is scheduled by activation DCI format 0.0 with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, the UE shall use single symbol front-loaded DM-RS of configuration type provided by higher layer parameter dmrs-Type in DMRSUplinkConfig on DM-RS port 0 and the remaining REs not used for DM-RS in the symbols are not used for any PUSCH transmission except for PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM symbols with transform precoding disabled, and additional DM-RS with dmrs-AdditionalPosition from ConfiguredGrantConfig can be transmitted according to the scheduling type and the PUSCH duration as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3 of [4, TS38.211] for frequency hopping disabled and as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-6 of [4, TS38.211] for frequency hopping enabled.

For the UE-specific reference signals generation as defined in Clause 6.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211], a UE can be configured by higher layers with one or two scrambling identity(s), \( n_{I D}^{\text {DMRS }{ }^{i} i} i=0,1 \) which are the same for both PUSCH mapping Type A and Type B.

When transmitted PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, or corresponding to a configured grant, or being a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure,
- for a configured-grant based PUSCH transmission in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE is provided with a set of DM-RS port(s) by sdt-DMRSports. The DM-RS port for the PUSCH is determined by the mapping between SS/PBCH block(s) and a PUSCH occasion and the associated DM-RS resource as described in Clause 19.1 of [6, TS 38.213].
- the UE may be configured with higher layer parameter dmrs-Type in DMRS-UplinkConfig, and the configured DM-RS configuration type is used for transmitting PUSCH in as defined in Clause 6.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211].
- the UE may be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PUSCH by higher layer parameter maxLength in DMRS-UplinkConfig, or by higher layer parameter msgA-MaxLength in msgA-DMRS-Config,
- if maxLength is not configured, single-symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI or configured by the configured grant configuration, and the UE can be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition, which can be 'pos0', 'pos1', 'pos2', 'pos3'.
- if maxLength is configured, either single-symbol DM-RS or double symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI or configured by the configured grant configuration, and the UE can be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition, which can be 'pos0' or 'pos1'.
- for msgA PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure the UE can be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer parameter msgA-DMRS-AdditionalPosition, which can be 'pos0', 'pos1', 'pos2', 'pos3' for single-symbol DM-RS or 'pos0', 'pos1' for double-symbol DM-RS.
- and, the UE shall transmit a number of additional DM-RS as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3 and Table 6.4.1.1.3-4 in -Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of [4, TS 38.211].

If a UE transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-0-2 or dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-0-2, or a UE transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) is configured with the higher layer parameter phaseTrackingRS in dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA or dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB, the UE may assume that the following configurations are not occurring simultaneously for the transmitted PUSCH
- any DM-RS ports among 4-7 or 6-11 for DM-RS configurations type 1 and type 2, respectively are scheduled for the UE and PT-RS is transmitted from the UE.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), by activation DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, or configured by configured grant Type 1 configuration, the UE shall assume the DM-RS CDM groups indicated in Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 of Clause 7.3.1.1 of [5, TS38.212] are not used for data transmission, where "1", "2" and "3" for the number of DM-RS CDM group(s) correspond to CDM group \( 0,\{0,1\},\{0,1,2\} \), respectively.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or by activation DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, the UE shall assume the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 1 which corresponds to CDM group 0 for the case of PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM symbols with transform precoding disabled, the UE shall assume that the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 3 which corresponds to CDM group \( \{0,1,2\} \) for the case of PUSCH scheduled by activation DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) and the dmrs-Type in DMRS-UplinkConfig equal to 'type2' and the
