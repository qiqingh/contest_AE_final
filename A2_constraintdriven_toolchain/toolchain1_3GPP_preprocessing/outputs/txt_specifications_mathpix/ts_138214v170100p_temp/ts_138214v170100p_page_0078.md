- else, the UE applies the first one of two TCI states corresponding to the lowest TCI codepoint among those mapped to two TCI states and applicable to the PDSCH within the active BWP of the cell in which the CSI-RS is to be received when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.
- else if a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA', it is not configured with enableTwoDefaultTCI-States, and the two TCI states are activated for the CORESET by the activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.x of [10, TS 38.321]
- if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with an offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \( \{14,28,48\} \) and when enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided or the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter trs-Info, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameters repetition and trs-Info scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48 when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on' scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided;
- else if, the UE applies the first one of two TCI states indicated for the CORESET with the lowest CORESET ID in the latest slot within the active BWP of the cell in which the CSI-RS is to be received when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS,
- else if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) and when enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided or the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter trs-Info, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameters repetition and trs-Info scheduled with offset larger than or equal to \( 48 \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}-3\right)} \) when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r 16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, aperiodic CSI-RS in a NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on' scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided;
- else if at least one CORESET is configured for the BWP in which the aperiodic CSI-RS is received, when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption used for the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored;
- else if the UE is configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS and when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the lowest-ID activated TCI state applicable to the PDSCH within the active BWP of the cell in which the CSI-RS is to be received.
- If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is equal to or greater than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values of \( \{14,28,48\} \). \( 2^{\text {max }\left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}-3\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is not configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, or is equal to or greater than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values of \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, or is equal to or greater than 48 . \( 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16 and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameters repetition and trs-Info, or is equal to or greater than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on', the UE is expected to apply
