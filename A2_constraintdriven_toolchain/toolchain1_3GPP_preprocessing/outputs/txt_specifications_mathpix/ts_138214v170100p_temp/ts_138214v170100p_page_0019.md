value ' 0 '. When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be scheduled with a DCI in slot \( n \) to receive a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI with \( K_{0} \) smaller than \( \left\lceil K_{0 \min } \cdot \frac{2 \mu^{\prime}}{2^{\mu}}\right\rceil \), where \( K_{0 \mathrm{~mm}} \) and \( \mu \) are the applied minimum scheduling offset restriction and the numerology of the active DL BWP of the scheduled cell when receiving the DCI in slot \( n \), respectively, and \( \mu^{\prime} \) is the numerology of the new active DL BWP in case of active DL BWP change in the scheduled cell and is equal to \( \mu \), otherwise. The minimum scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PDSCH transmission is scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in common search space associated with CORESET0 and default PDSCH time domain resource allocation is used, in the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceld when monitoring PDCCH as described in [6, TS 38.213] or when PDSCH transmission is scheduled with SI-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI or RA-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1.

The UE is not expected to be configured with referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2 for serving cells configured for cross-carrier scheduling with a scheduling cell of a different downlink SCS configuration.

When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' and indicated DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the number of PDSCH transmission occasions is derived by the number of TCI states indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' of the scheduling DCI.
- If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication', the UE is expected to receive two PDSCH transmission occasions, where the first TCI state is applied to the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1. The second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion, and the second PDSCH transmission occasion shall have the same number of symbols as the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the UE is configured by the higher layers with a value \( \bar{K} \) in StartingSymbolOffsetK, it shall determine that the first symbol of the second PDSCH transmission occasion starts after \( \bar{K} \) symbols from the last symbol of the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the value \( \bar{K} \) is not configured via the higher layer parameter StartingSymbolOffsetK, \( \bar{K}=0 \) shall be assumed by the UE. The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion. For two PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where \( n=0,1 \) applied respectively to the first and second TCI state. The UE expects the PDSCH mapping type indicated by DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' to be mapping type B , and the indicated PDSCH mapping type is applied to both PDSCH transmission occasions.
- Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause 5.1.2.1.

When a UE configured by the higher layer parameter PDSCH-config that indicates at least one entry contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation,
- If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' together with the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicating an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocation and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the repetitionNumber consecutive slots, the first TCI state is applied to the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1.

When the value indicated by repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation equals to two, the second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion. When the value indicated by repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation is larger than two, the UE may be further configured to enable cyclicMapping or sequenticalMapping in tciMapping.
- When cyclicMapping is enabled, the first and second TCI states are applied to the first and second PDSCH transmission occasions, respectively, and the same TCI mapping pattern continues to the remaining PDSCH transmission occasions.
- When sequenticalMapping is enabled, first TCI state is applied to the first and second PDSCH transmission occasions, and the second TCI state is applied to the third and fourth PDSCH transmission occasions, and the same TCI mapping pattern continues to the remaining PDSCH transmission occasions.

The UE may expect that each PDSCH transmission occasion is limited to two transmission layers. For all PDSCH transmission occasions associated with the first TCI state, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where \( n \) is counted only considering PDSCH transmission occasions associated with the first TCI state.
