each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS port, and the SRS port of each resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port. In the case of two resource sets a total of six SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. In the case of three resource sets a total of six SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of three different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given three sets is associated with a different UE antenna port, or
- For 1T8R, zero or one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic', where in the case of one resource set has eight SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS port, and the SRS port of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port, and
- For 1T8R, zero or one SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semipersistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semipersistent' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same time. Each SRS resource set has eight SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS port, and the SRS port of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port, and
- For 1T8R, zero or two or three or four SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic', where in the case of two resource sets a total of eight SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. In the case of three resource sets a total of eight SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of three different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given three sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. In the case of four resource sets a total of eight SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of four different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the given four sets is associated with a different UE antenna port, or
- For 2T6R, zero or one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic', where in the case of one resource set has three SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port pair, and
- For 2T6R, zero or one SRS resource sets configured resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semi-persistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], where the two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' are not activated at the same time. Each SRS resource set has three SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port pair, and
- For 2T6R, zero or one or two or three SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'aperiodic, where in the case of one resource set has three SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port pair. In the case of two resource sets a total of three SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of two different slots, and where the SRS port pair of each SRS resource in the given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port pair. One set is configured with two SRS resources and another set with one resource. In the case of three resource sets a total of three SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of three different slots, and where the SRS port pair of each SRS resource in the given three sets is associated with a different UE antenna port pair, or
- For 2T8R, zero or one SRS resource set configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'periodic', where in the case of one resource set has four SRS resources transmitted in different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a two SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the resource in the set is associated with a different UE antenna port pair, and
- For 2T8R, zero or one SRS resource sets configured with resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'semipersistent' if the UE is not indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource sets], or up to two SRS resource sets configured with 'semi-persistent' and up to one SRS resource set configured with 'periodic' if the UE is indicating a capability for [maximum 2 semi-persistent and maximum 1
