- \( k \) is configured via higher layer parameter slotOffset for each triggered SRS resources set and is based on the subcarrier spacing of the triggered SRS transmission, \( \mu_{S R S} \) and \( \mu_{P D C C H} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command, respectively;
- \( N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \( N_{\text {slot, }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) offset, SRS and \( \mu_{\text {off set, } \mathrm{SRS}} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) offset and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5.
- An available slot is a slot satisfying there are UL or flexible symbol(s) for the time-domain location(s) for all the SRS resources in the resource set and it satisfies UE capability on the minimum timing requirement between triggering PDCCH and all the SRS resources in the resource set. From the first symbol carrying the SRS request DCI to the last symbol of the triggered SRS resource set, UE does not expect to receive SFI indication, UL cancellation indication or dynamic scheduling of DL channel/signal(s) on flexible symbol(s) that may change the determination of available slot.
- \( t \) is configured via higher layer parameter availableSlotOffset with up to four different values for each triggered SRS resources set and is based on the subcarrier spacing of the triggered SRS transmission. When one or more SRS resource sets across all configured BWPs in a component carrier are configured, and at least one resource set is configured with availableSlotOffset parameter of more than one values, the indicated value of availableSlotOffset is indicated by SOI field in DCI scheduling PUSCH/PDSCH and DCI 0_1/0_2 without data and without CSI request described in [5, TS 38.212]. The UE shall apply indicated value of availableSlotOffset set specifically for those sets with configured availableSlotOffset parameter. When one or more SRS resource sets across all configured BWPs in a component carrier are configured and at least one resource set is configured with availableSlotOffset parameter, and the availableSlotOffset parameter for each SRS resource set has only one value, the UE shall apply the configured value of availableSlotOffset specifically for those sets with configured availableSlotOffset parameter. For SRS resource set configured with availableSlotOffset parameter, each of resource set is configured with \( K \) values of availableSlotOffset parameter. For SRS resource set configured without availableSlotOffset parameter, \( t=0 \) is applied for each of resource set.
- If the UE receives the DCI triggering aperiodic SRS in slot \( n \) and none of the resource sets is configured with parameter availableSlotOffset across all configured BWPs in a component carrier, and if the UE is configured with ca-SlotOffset for at least one of the triggered and triggering cell, except when SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in slot \( \left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{S R S}}}{2^{\mu_{P D C C H}}}\right\rfloor+k+\left\lfloor\left(\frac{N_{\text {slot }, \text { offset }, P D C C H}^{C A}}{2^{\mu_{0 f f e r}, P D C C H}}-\frac{N_{\text {slot }, \text { offset }, S R S}^{C A}}{2^{\mu_{0 f f e}, S R S}}\right) \cdot 2^{\mu S R S}\right\rfloor \), otherwise, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the triggered resource set(s) in slot \( K_{s}=\left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {SRS }}}}{2^{\mu_{\text {PDCCH }}}}\right\rfloor+K+K_{\text {offset }} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {SRS }}}}{2^{\mu_{\text {IN }}} \text { offset }} \), where \( K_{\text {offset }} \) is a parameter configured by higher layer as specified in clause 4.2 of [6 TS 38.213], and where
- \( k \) is configured via higher layer parameter slotOffset for each triggered SRS resources set and is based on the subcarrier spacing of the triggered SRS transmission, \( \mu_{S R S} \) and \( \mu_{P D C C H} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command respectively;
- \( \mu_{K_{o f f s e t}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( K_{o f f s e t} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1.
- \( N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {off set, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \( N_{\text {slot, offset, SRS }}^{C A} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, SRS }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot,offsel }}^{C A} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the SRS, as defined in [4, TS 38.211] clause 4.5.
- If the UE receives the DCI triggering aperiodic SRS in slot \( n \) and when SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource, the UE transmits every aperiodic SRS resource in each of the triggered SRS ca-SlotOffset for at least one of the triggered and triggering cell, \( K_{s}=\left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {SRS }}}}{2^{\mu_{\text {PDCCH }}}}\right\rfloor+K+K_{\text {offset }} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {SRS }}}}{2^{\mu_{\text {Offset }}}} \),
