For the PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI \( =1 \), the parameters in pusch-Config are applied for the PUSCH transmission except for p0-NominalWithoutGrant, p0-PUSCH-Alpha, powerControlLoopToUse, pathlossReferenceIndex described in clause 7.1 of [6, TS 38.213], mcs-Table, mcsTableTransformPrecoder described in clause 6.1.4.1 and transformPrecoder described in clause 6.1.3.

For a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission of that TB.

A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format \( 0 \_0,0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in [10, TS38.321]. Upon detection of a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) with 'UL-SCH indicator' set to ' 0 ' and with a non-zero 'CSI request' where the associated reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig set to 'none' for all CSI report(s) triggered by 'CSI request' in this DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the 'CSI request' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by this DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \). When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process [D is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssbPositionsInBurst. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoollndex, for any two HARQ process [Ds in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \( j \) by a PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \) on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol \( i \) of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format \( 0 \_0,0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.

If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol \( j \) by a PDCCH associated with a value of coresetPoollndex ending in symbol \( i \), the UE can be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH associated with a different value of coresetPoollndex that ends later than symbol \( i \).

A UE is not expected to be scheduled by a PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \) to transmit a PUSCH on a given serving cell overlapping in time with a transmission occasion, where the UE is allowed to transmit a PUSCH with configured grant according to [10, TS38.321], starting in a symbol \( j \) on the same serving cell if the end of symbol \( i \) is not at least \( N_{2} \) symbols before the beginning of symbol \( j \). The value \( N_{2} \) in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in Clause 6.4, and \( N_{2} \) and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with configured grant and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH.

If a UE receives an ACK for a given HARQ process in CG-DFI in a PDCCH ending in symbol \( i \) to terminate a transport block repetition in a PUSCH transmission with a configured grant on a given serving cell with the same HARQ process after symbol \( i \), the UE is expected to terminate the repetition of the transport block in a PUSCH transmission starting from a symbol \( j \) if the gap between the end of PDCCH of symbol \( i \) and the start of the PUSCH transmission in symbol \( j \) is equal to or more than \( N 2 \) symbols. The value \( N 2 \) in symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined in Clause 6.4, and \( N 2 \) and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH indicating CG-DFI. A UE is not expected to be
