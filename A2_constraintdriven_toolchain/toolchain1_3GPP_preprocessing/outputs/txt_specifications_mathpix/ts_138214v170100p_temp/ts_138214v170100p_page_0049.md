When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA', and CORESET is activated with two TCI states, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDCCH in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states. When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeB', and a CORESET is activated with two TCI states, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDCCH is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states except for quasi co-location parameters \{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\} of the second indicated TCI state.

For the DM-RS of PDSCH, the UE shall expect that a TCI-State or DLorJointTCIState except an indicated DLorJointTCIState indicates one of the following quasi co-location type(s):
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same CSI-RS resource, or
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or
- typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info and without higher layer parameter repetition and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same CSI-RS resource.

For the DM-RS of PDCCH, the UE shall expect that an indicated DLorJointTCIState indicates one of the following quasi co-location type(s):
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same CSI-RS resource, or
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition.

For the DM-RS of PDSCH, the UE shall expect that an indicated DLorJointTCIState indicates one of the following quasi co-location type(s) if the UE is configured [TCI-State](s) with [tci-Stateld_r] 7]:
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with the same CSI-RS resource, or
- 'typeA' with a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info and, when applicable, 'typeD' with a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition.

When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch set to 'sfnSchemeA', and the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in a DCI scheduling a PDSCH, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDSCH is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states. When a UE is configured with sfnSchemePdsch set to 'sfnSchemeB', and the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in a DCI scheduling a PDSCH, the UE shall assume that the DM-RS port(s)of the PDSCH is quasi co-located with the DL-RSs of the two TCI states except for quasi co-location parameters \{Doppler shift, Doppler spread\} of the second indicated TCI state.
5.1.6 UE procedure for receiving reference signals
5.1.6.1 CSI-RS reception procedure

The CSI-RS defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211], may be used for time/frequency tracking, CSI computation, L1-RSRP computation, L1-SINR computation, mobility, and tracking during fast SCell activation.

For a CSI-RS resource associated with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on', the UE shall not expect to be configured with CSI-RS over the symbols during which the UE is also configured to monitor the CORESET, while for other NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configurations, if the UE is configured with a CSI-RS resource and a search space set associated with a CORESET in the same OFDM symbol(s), the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and a PDCCH DM-RS transmitted in all the search space sets associated with CORESET are quasi co-located with 'typeD', if 'typeD' is applicable. If the CORESET is activated with two TCI states, UE may assume that the first TCI state of the CORESET as the default QCL assumption for the CSI-RS. This also applies to the case when CSI-RS and the CORESET are in different intra-band component carriers, if 'typeD' is applicable. Furthermore, the UE shall not
