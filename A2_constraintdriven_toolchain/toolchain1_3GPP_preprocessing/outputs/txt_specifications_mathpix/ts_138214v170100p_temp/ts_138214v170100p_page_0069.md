A CSI Reporting Setting is said to have a wideband frequency-granularity if
- reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', cqi-FormatIndicator is set to 'widebandCQI' and pmi-FormatIndicator is set to 'widebandPMI', or
- reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', codebookType is set to 'type[I-PortSelectionr17' with \( M=1 \) and cqi-FormatIndicator is set to 'widebandCQI', or
- reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-i1' or
- reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-i1-CQI' and cqi-FormatIndicator is set to 'widebandCQI', or
- reportQuantity is set to 'cri-RSRP' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP' or 'cri-SINR', or 'ssb-Index-SINR' or 'cri-RSRPCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index', or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'
otherwise, the CSI Reporting Setting is said to have a subband frequency-granularity.
A CSI Reporting Setting with codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel' and the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement configured with two Resource Groups and \( N \) Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, can be configured with wideband frequency-granularity only if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to \( X=0 \), as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2.

If the UE is configured with a CSI Reporting Setting for a bandwidth part with fewer than 24 PRBs, the CSI reporting setting is expected to have a wideband frequency-granularity, and, if applicable, the higher layer parameter codebookType is set to 'typel-SinglePanel'.

The first subband size is given by \( N_{P R B}^{S B}-\left(N_{B I T P_{j}}^{S^{\text {stor }}} \bmod N_{P R B}^{S B}\right) \) and the last subband size given by \( \left(N_{B I T P_{j},}^{\text {start }}+N_{B I R P_{j},}^{\text {size }}\right) \bmod N_{P R B}^{S B} \) if

If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic.

A UE configured with DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 does not expect to be triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same CSI-ReportConfigld.
5.2.1.4.1 Resource Setting configuration

For aperiodic CSI, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is not configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with one or multiple CSI-ReportConfig where each CSIReportConfig is linked to periodic, or semi-persistent, or aperiodic resource setting(s):
- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference measurement for L1-SINR computation.
- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference or higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for interference measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.
- When three Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement) is for channel measurement, the second one (given by higher layer parameter csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference) is for CSI-[M based interference measurement and the third one (given by higher layer parameter nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference) is for NZP CSI-RS based interference measurement.

For aperiodic CSI, and for periodic and semi-persistent CSI resource settings, if groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, each trigger state configured using the higher layer parameter CSI-AperiodicTriggerState is associated with one or multiple CSI-ReportConfig where each CSI-ReportConfig is linked to periodic or semi-persistent, setting(s):
