- The UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel', and
- The UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI(s) conditioned on the reported CRI(s), as follows:
- If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to \( X \in\{0,1,2\}, X+1 \mathrm{CRI}(\mathrm{s}) \) are reported:
- one CRI \( k_{1}\left(k_{1} \geq 0\right) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k_{1}+1 \) )-th entry of the associated \( N \) Resource Pairs in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( \( M+k_{1}+1 \) )-th entry of the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured. The UE shall report two RIs, two PMIs, two Lis (if configured), associated to the resource in Group 1 and the resource in Group 2, respectively, of the ( \( k_{1}+ \) 1)-th Resource Pair, and one CQ[; and
- if \( X=1 \), one CRI \( k_{2}\left(k_{2} \geq 0\right) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k_{2}+1 \) )-th entry of the associated \( M \) resources in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( \( k_{2}+1 \) )-th entry of the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured. The UE shall report one RI, one PMI, one LI (if configured) and one or two CQIs conditioned on CRI \( k_{2} \); or
- if \( X=2 \), one CRI \( k_{2}\left(k_{2} \geq 0\right) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k_{2}+1 \) )-th entry of the associated \( M_{1} \) resources in Group 1 of the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( \( k_{2}+1 \) )th entry of the associated resources in the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured, and one CRI \( k_{3}\left(k_{3} \geq 0\right) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k_{3}+1 \) )-th entry of the associated \( M_{2} \) resources in Group 2 of the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( \( M_{1}+k_{3}+1 \) )-th entry of the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured. The UE shall report one RI, one PMI, one LI (if configured) and one or two CQIs conditioned on CRI \( k_{2} \) and one RI, one PMI, one LI (if configured) and one or two CQIs conditioned on CRI \( k_{3} \).
- If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode2', one CRI \( k_{1}\left(k_{1} \geq 0\right) \) is reported, which corresponds to the ( \( k_{1}+1 \) )-th entry of the \( M+N \) resources or Resource Pairs in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement, and ( \( k_{1}+1 \) )-th entry of the associated resources in the corresponding CSI-IM Resource Set, if configured. The first \( M \) codepoints of the CRI correspond to resources associated to Group 1 and Group 2. The last \( N \) codepoints of the CRI correspond to the \( N \) configured Resource Pairs. The UE shall report one RI, one PMI, one LI, if configured, and one or two CQIs conditioned on CRI \( k_{1} \) if \( k_{1}<M \); or two RIs, two PMIs, two LIs, if configured, associated to the resource in Group 1 and the resource in Group 2, respectively, of the ( \( k_{1}-M+1 \) )-th Resource Pair, and one CQI, otherwise.
- For a reported CRI corresponding to an entry of the \( N \) Resource Pairs configured in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement:
- the UE shall not report a total number of layers larger than four.
- the two RIs are reported with a joint RI index corresponding to one of the four rank combinations: \( \{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{2,1\},\{2,2\} \).
- The CodebookConfig in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured with two RI restriction parameters. One parameter applies to a reported RI when conditioned on a CRI corresponding to an entry of the \( M \) CSI-RS resources defined above. Another parameter applies to a reported joint RI index when conditioned on a CRI corresponding to an entry of the \( N \) Resource Pairs and indicates one or more of the four rank combinations that are allowed to correspond to the reported PMIs and RIs.
- The CodebookConfig in CSI-ReportConfig can be configured with two Codebook Subset Restrictions. The first restriction applies to a reported PMI associated to a CSI-RS resource in Group 1. The second restriction applies to a reported PMI associated to a CSI-RS resource in Group 2.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'ssb-Index-RSRP' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', the UE shall report SSBRI, where SSBRI \( k(k \geq 0) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of the associated csi-SSB-ResourceList in the corresponding CSI-SSB-ResourceSet.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'ssb-Index-SINR' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index', the UE shall derive L1-SINR conditioned on the reported SSBRI, where SSBRI \( k(k \geq 0) \) corresponds to the configured \( (k+1) \)-th entry of the associated csi-SSB-ResourceList in the corresponding CSI-SSB-ResourceSet for channel measurement, and ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of associated csi-IM-Resource in the
