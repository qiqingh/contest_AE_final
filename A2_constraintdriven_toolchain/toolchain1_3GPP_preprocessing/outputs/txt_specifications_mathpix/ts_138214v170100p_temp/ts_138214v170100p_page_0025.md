resourceAllocationDCI-1-2 for DCI format 1 _2 or by the higher layer parameter resourceAllocation in PDSCH-ConfigMulticast for DCI format 4_2.

If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.

For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the downlink RB set of a PDSCH when scheduled by DCI format \( 1 \_0 \), the CORESET with lower ID among two CORESETs associated with two PDCCH candidates is used.
5.1.2.2.1 Downlink resource allocation type 0

In downlink resource allocation of type 0 , the resource block assignment information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups (RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter rbg-Size configured by PDSCH-Config and the size of the bandwidth part as defined in Table 5.1.2.2.1-1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 5.1.2.2.1-1: Nominal RBG size \( P \)}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Bandwidth Part Size & Configuration 1 & Configuration 2 \\
\hline \( 1-36 \) & 2 & 4 \\
\hline \( 37-72 \) & 4 & 8 \\
\hline \( 73-144 \) & 8 & 16 \\
\hline \( 145-275 \) & 16 & 16 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The total number of RBGs ( \( N_{\text {RBG }} \) ) for a downlink bandwidth part \( i \) of size \( N_{\text {BW } \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}, \mathrm{P}}^{\text {size }} \) PRBs is given by \( N_{\text {RBG }}= \left\lceil\left(N_{B W P, i}^{\text {size }}+\left(N_{B W P, i}^{\text {start }} \bmod P\right)\right) / P\right\rceil \), where
- the size of the first RBG is \( R B G_{0}^{\text {size }}=P-N_{B W P, i}^{\text {start }} \bmod P \),
- the size of last RBG is \( R B G_{\text {last }}^{\text {size }}=\left(N_{B W P, i}^{\text {start }}+N_{B W P, i}^{\text {size }}\right) \bmod P \) if \( \left(N_{B W P, i}^{\text {start }}+N_{B W P, i}^{\text {size }}\right) \bmod P>0 \) and \( P \) otherwise,
- the size of all other RBGs is \( P \).

In downlink resource allocation of type 0 scheduled using a DCI with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the resource block assignment information bitmap is calculated based on the description above with the following changes: the parameter \( N_{B W P, i}^{\text {start }} \) is the starting PRB of the CFR, \( N_{B W P, i}^{\text {size }} \) is the size of the common frequency resource (CFR) and the value of the higher layer parameter rbg-Size is configured by PDSCH-Config-Multicast.

The bitmap is of size \( N_{\text {RBG }} \) bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each RBG is addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing frequency and starting at the lowest frequency of the bandwidth part. The order of RBG bitmap is such that RBG 0 to RBG \( N_{\text {RBG }}-1 \) are mapped from MSB to LSB. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the corresponding bit value in the bitmap is 1 , the RBG is not allocated to the UE otherwise.
5.1.2.2.2 Downlink resource allocation type 1

In downlink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated non-interleaved or interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part of size \( N_{\text {BWP }}^{\text {size }} \) PRBs except for the case when DCI format 1_0 is decoded in any common search space in which case the size of CORESET 0 shall be used if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell and the size of initial DL bandwidth part shall be used if CORESET 0 is not configured for the cell.
