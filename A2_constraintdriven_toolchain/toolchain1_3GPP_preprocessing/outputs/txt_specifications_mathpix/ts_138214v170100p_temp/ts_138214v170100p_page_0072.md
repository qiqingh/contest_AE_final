- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 , the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance nrofReportedRSgroup, if configured, group(s) of two CRIs or SSBRIs selecting one CSI-RS or SSB from each of the two CSI Resource Sets for the report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources of each group can be received simultaneously by the UE.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR', 'ssb-Index-SINR', 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set][ndex',
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting.
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI ', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI', 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-SINR', or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index', and \( K_{s}>1 \) resources are configured in the corresponding resource set for channel measurement, then the UE shall derive the CSI parameters other than CRI conditioned on the reported CRI, where CRI \( k(k \geq 0) \) corresponds to the configured ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet for channel measurement, and ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of associated csi-IM-Resource in the corresponding csi-IMResourceSet (if configured) or ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of associated nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RSResourceSet (if configured for CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-SINR' or 'cri-SINRCapability[Set][ndex') for interference measurement. If \( K_{s}=2 \mathrm{CSI} \)-RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS ports. If \( 2<K_{s} \leq 8 \) CSI-RS resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 8 CSI-RS ports.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMICQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI' and the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement is configured with \( K_{s} \geq 2 \) resources, two Resource Groups with \( K_{1} \geq 1 \) resources in Group 1, \( K_{2} \geq 1 \) resources in Group 2, \( K_{1}+ K_{2}=K_{s} \), and \( N \) Resource Pairs:
- each resource can contain, subject to UE capability, at most 32 CSI-RS ports.
- each of the \( N \) Resource Pairs is associated to a CRI value.
- The CSI-ReportConfig may be configured with higher layer parameter sharedCMR. \( M_{1} \) and \( M_{2} \) are the numbers of resources associated to a CRI value, other than the \( N \) CRIs defined above, in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, with \( M=M_{1}+M_{2} \), such that the total number of CRI values configured for the CSI-ReportConfig is \( M+N \).
- If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Model' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to \( X \in\{0\}, M_{1}=M_{2}=0 \); otherwise,
- if the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode1' and the higher layer parameter numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Model is set to \( X \in\{1,2\} \), or if csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode2',
- if shared \( C M R \) is configured: \( M_{1}=K_{1} \) and \( M_{2}=K_{2} \); otherwise
- if sharedCMR is not configured, only the resources in Group 1 and Group 2 that are not referred to in any Resource Pair are associated to \( M \) CRI values other than the \( N \) CRIs defined above.
- If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, \( M+N \) resources are configured in the corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet. The \( M \) resources for channel measurement defined above are resource-wise associated with the first \( M \) CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources in the corresponding Resource Set. The \( N \) Resource Pairs for channel measurement are associated to the last \( N \) CSI-IM resources by the ordering of the CSI-RS Resource Pairs and CSI-IM resources in the CSI-IM Resource Set. The UE may assume that the two CSI-RS resources for channel measurement in a Resource Pair and the associated CSI-IM resource for interference measurement are resource-wise QCLed with respect to 'typeD'.
- The UE is not expected to be configured with NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement other than the NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement configured in the \( N \) Resource Pairs.
