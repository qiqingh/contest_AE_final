SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \( \mu_{K_{\text {mac }}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( k_{\text {mac }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \( k_{\mathrm{mac}} \) is provided by \( K-M a c \) or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K-M a c \) is not provided
- When the number of CSI triggering states in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is less than or equal to \( 2^{N_{T s}}-1 \), the CSI request field in DCI directly indicates the triggering state.
- For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi co-location type(s), as described in clause 5.1.5, through higher layer signaling of qcl-info which contains a list of references to TCIState's for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the CSI triggering state. If a State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semipersistent located in the same or different CC/DL BWP.
- If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], when the reported value is one of the values of \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}-3\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, or is smaller than \( 48 \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) when the UE provides beamSwitchTiming-r16, enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'off' or configured without the higher layer parameter repetition, or is smaller than the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming-r 16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided and the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to 'on'.
- If a UE is configured with enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoollndex and the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet
- if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoolIndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48. \( 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}-3\right)} \) when the reported value of beamSwitchTiming-r 16 is one of the values \( \{224,336\} \). \( 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}{ }^{-3}\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS;
- else, the UE applies the QCL parameter(s) of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld among CORESETs, which are configured with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic CSI-RS, in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs are associated with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic CSI-RS
- else if a UE is configured with enableTwoDefaultTCI-States and at least one TCI codepoint is mapped to two TCI states
- if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold timeDurationForQCL, as defined in [13, TS 38.306], aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE reported threshold beamSwitchTiming when the reported value is one of the values \( \{14,28,48\} \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu_{\text {CSIRS }}{ }^{-3}\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to \( 48 \cdot 2^{\max \left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) when the reported value of beamSwitchTiming-r16 is one of the values \( \{224,336\} \cdot 2^{\text {max }\left(0, \mu \text { CSIRS }^{-3}\right)} \) and enableBeamSwitchTiming is provided, periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS. If there is a PDSCH indicated with two TCI states in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the first TCI state of the two TCI states when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.
