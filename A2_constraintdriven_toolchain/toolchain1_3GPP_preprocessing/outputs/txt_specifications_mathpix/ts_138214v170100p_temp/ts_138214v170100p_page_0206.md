- Optionally, minimum number of \( Y^{\prime} \) slots as \( Y^{\prime}{ }_{\min } \) (minNumCandidatteSlotsAperiodic), which indicates the minimum number of \( Y^{\prime} \) slots that are included in the resources corresponding to contiguous partial sensing.
- Optionally, sensing occasion as periodicSensingOccasionReservePeriodList, which indicates the subset of periodicity values from sl-ResourceReservePeriodList used to determine periodic sensing occasions in periodicbased partial sensing. If not configured, all periodicity values from sl-ResourceReservePeriodList are used to determine periodic sensing occasions in periodic-based partial sensing.
- Optionally, additional sensing occasions as additionalPeriodicSensingOccasion, which indicates that UE additionally monitors periodic sensing occasions that correspond to a set of values. The possible values of the set at least includes the most recent sensing occasion before the first slot of the candidate slots for a given reservation periodicity and the last periodic sensing occasion prior to the most recent one for the given reservation periodicity. If not configured, the UE monitors the most recent sensing occasion before the first slot of the candidate slots for the given periodicity used to determine periodic sensing occasions in periodic-based partial sensing.
- Optionally, indication of the size in logical slots of contiguous partial sensing window as contiguousSensing WindowPeriodic.

Optionally, indication of the size in logical slots of contiguous partial sensing window as contiguousSensingWindowAperiodic.
- Optionally, indication of whether UE is required to perform SL reception of PSCCH and RSRP measurement for partial sensing on slots in SL DRX inactive time as partialSensinglnactiveTime.

The resource reservation interval, \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }} \), if provided, is converted from units of msec to units of logical slots, resulting in \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }}^{\prime} \) according to clause 8.1.7.

When the resource pool is (pre-)configured with allowedResourceSelectionConfig including full sensing, and full sensing is (pre-)configured in the UE by higher layers, the UE performs full sensing.

When periodic reservation for another TB (sl-MultiReserveResource) is enabled for the resource pool, the resource pool is (pre-)configured with allowedResourceSelectionConfig including partial sensing, and partial sensing is (pre-) configured in the UE by higher layer, the UE performs periodic-based partial sensing.

When a UE is triggered by higher layer to report resources for resource (re-)selection in a mode 2 Tx pool, the resource pool is (pre-)configured with allowedResourceSelectionConfig including partial sensing, and partial sensing is configured by higher layer, the UE may perform contiguous partial sensing.

Notation:
\( \left(t^{\prime S L}, t^{\prime S L}, t^{\prime S L}, \ldots\right) \) denotes the set of slots which belongs to the sidelink resource pool and is defined in Clause 8 .
The following steps are used:
1) A candidate single-slot resource for transmission \( R_{\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}} \) is defined as a set of \( L_{\text {subCH }} \) contiguous sub-channels with sub-channel \( x+j \) in slot \( t_{y}^{\prime S L} \) where \( j=0, \ldots, L_{\text {sub CH }}-1 \). The UE shall assume that any set of \( L_{\text {subCH }} \) contiguous sub-channels included in the corresponding resource pool within the time interval \( \left[n+T_{1}, n+T_{2}\right] \) correspond to one candidate single-slot resource for UE performing full sensing, in a set of \( Y \) candidate slots within the time interval \( \left[n+T_{1}, n+T_{2}\right] \) for UE performing periodic-based partial sensing correspond to one candidate singleslot resource, or in a set of \( Y^{\prime} \) candidate slots within the time interval \( \left[n+T_{1}, n+T_{2}\right] \) for UE performing contiguous partial sensing if \( P_{\text {rsvp_tx }}=0 \), correspond to one candidate single-slot resource, where
- selection of \( T_{1} \) is up to UE implementation under \( 0 \leq T_{1} \leq T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \), where \( T_{\text {proc }, 1}^{S L} \) is defined in slots in Table 8.1.4-2 where \( \mu_{S L} \) is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP;
- if \( T_{2 \text { min }} \) is shorter than the remaining packet delay budget (in slots) then \( T_{2} \) is up to UE implementation subject to \( T_{2 \text { min }} \leq T_{2} \leq \) remaining packet delay budget (in slots); otherwise \( T_{2} \) is set to the remaining packet delay budget (in slots).
- \( Y \) is selected by UE where \( Y \geq Y_{\text {min }} \) -
