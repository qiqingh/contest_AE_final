- A UE is not expected to receive more than one CSI request per reference slot length across all CCs in a cell group, where the SCS of the reference slot is the minimum of SCS of the PDCCH with which the DCI was transmitted, the SCS of the PUSCH with which the CSI report is to be transmitted, and the SCS of the minimum SCS of the CSI-RS associated to the CSI reports triggered by the DCI. The beginning of a slot length is defined according the PDCCH cell with which the DCI carrying the CSI request is transmitted.
- CSI reporting constraints:
- A UE is not expected to receive more than one CSI request for transmission in a given reference slot length across all CCs in a cell group, where the SCS of the reference slot is the minimum of SCS of the PDCCH with which the DCI was transmitted, the SCS of the PUSCH with which the CSI report is to be transmitted, and the SCS of the minimum SCS of the CSI-RS associated to the CSI reports triggered by the DCI. The beginning of a slot length is defined according the PUSCH cell with which the CSI report is transmitted.
5.2.1.5.2 Semi-persistent CSI/Semi-persistent CSI-RS

For semi-persistent reporting on PUSCH, a set of trigger states are higher layer configured by CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList, where the CSI request field in DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activates one of the trigger states. A UE is not expected to receive a DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activating one semipersistent CSI report with the same CSI-ReportConfigId as in semi-persistent CSI report which is activated by a previously received DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI.

For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH , the PUCCH resource used for transmitting the CSI report are configured by reportConfigType. Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }}, \mu \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

For a UE configured with CSI resource setting(s) where the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'semiPersistent'.
- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.12 of [10, TS 38.321], for CSI-RS resource set(s) for channel measurement and CSI-[M/NZP CSI-RS resource set(s) for interference measurement associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the selection command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions (including QCL assumptions provided by a list of reference to TCI-State's, one per activated resource) on CSI-RS/CSI-[M transmission corresponding to the configured CSI-RS/CSI-[Mresource configuration(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+ 3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu}+\frac{2^{\mu}}{2^{\mu_{K}}{ }^{\text {rac }}} \cdot k_{\text {mac }} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \( \mu_{K_{\text {mac }}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( k_{\text {mac }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \( k_{\text {mac }} \) is provided by \( K-M a c \) or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K-M a c \) is not provided. If a TCI-State referred to in the list is configured with a reference to an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', that RS can be an SS/PBCH block, periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS located in same or different CC/DL BWP.
- when a UE receives a deactivation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.12 of [10, TS 38.321], for activated CSI-RS/CSI-[M resource set(s) associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and UE assumption on cessation of CS[-RS/CSI-[M transmission corresponding to the deactivated CSI-RS/CSI-[M resource set(s) shall apply starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }{ }^{\mu}}+\frac{2^{\mu}}{2^{\mu} K_{\text {mac }}} \cdot k_{\text {mac }} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \( \mu_{K_{m a c}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( k_{m a c} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \( k_{\mathrm{mac}} \) is provided by \( K-M a c \) or \( k_{\mathrm{mac}}=0 \) if \( K-M a c \) is not provided.

A codepoint of the CSI request field in the DCI is mapped to a SP-CSI triggering state according to the order of the positions of the configured trigger states in CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList, with codepoint '0' mapped to the triggering state in the first position. A UE validates, for semi-persistent CSI activation or release, a PDCCH on a DCI only if the following conditions are met:
- the CRC parity bits of the DCI format are scrambled with a SP-CSI-RNTI provided by higher layer parameter sp-CSI-RNTI
- Special fields for the DCI format are set according to Table 5.2.1.5.2-1 or Table 5.2.1.5.2-2.
