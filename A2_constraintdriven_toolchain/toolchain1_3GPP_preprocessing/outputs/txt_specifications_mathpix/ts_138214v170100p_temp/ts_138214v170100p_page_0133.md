5.4 UE CSI computation time

When the CSI request field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH, the UE shall provide a valid CSI report for the \( n \)-th triggered report,
- if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s) including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol \( Z_{\text {ref }} \), and
- if the first uplink symbol to carry the \( n \)-th CSI report including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol \( Z_{\text {ref }}^{\prime}(n) \),
where \( Z_{\text {ref }} \) is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting \( T_{\text {wo.CE }}=(Z)(2048+144) \cdot K 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}+T_{\text {meach }} \) after the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the CSI report(s), and where \( Z_{\text {ref }}(n) \), is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting \( T^{\dagger}{ }_{\sigma \alpha \cdot C V}=\left(Z^{\prime}\right)(2048+144) \cdot K 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last symbol in time of the latest of: aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for the \( n \)-th triggered CSI report, and where \( T_{\text {switch }} \) is defined in clause 6.4 and is applied only if \( Z_{1} \) of table 5.4-1 is applied.

If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with another PUCCH or PUSCH, then the CSI report(s) are multiplexed following the procedure in clause 9.2 .5 of [6, TS 38.213] and clause 5.2 .5 when applicable, otherwise the CSI report(s) are transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by the DCI.

When the CSI request field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH, if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s) including the effect of the timing advance, starts earlier than at symbol \( Z_{\text {ref, }} \)
- the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI if no HARQ-ACK or transport block is multiplexed on the PUSCH.

When the CSI request field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH, if the first uplink symbol to carry the \( n \)-th CSI report including the effect of the timing advance, starts earlier than at symbol \( Z_{\text {reff }}^{\prime}(n) \),
- the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI if the number of triggered reports is one and no HARQ-ACK or transport block is multiplexed on the PUSCH
- Otherwise, the UE is not required to update the CSI for the \( n \)-th triggered CSI report.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the CSI report(s), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.
\( Z, Z^{\prime} \) and \( \mu \) are defined as:
\( Z=\max _{m=0, \ldots, M-1}(Z(m)) \) and \( Z^{\prime}=\max _{m=0, \ldots, M-1}\left(Z^{\prime}(m)\right) \), where \( M \) is the number of updated CSI report(s) according to Clause 5.2.1.6, \( \left(Z(m), Z^{\prime}(m)\right) \) corresponds to the \( m \)-th updated CSI report and is defined as
- \( \left(Z_{1}, Z_{1}^{\prime}\right) \) of the table 5-4-1 if \( \max \left\{\mu_{P D C C H}, \mu_{C S T-R S}, \mu_{U L}\right\} \leq 3 \) and if the CSI is triggered without a PUSCH with either transport block or HARQ-ACK or both when \( L=0 \) CPUs are occupied (according to Clause 5.2.1.6) and the CSI to be transmitted is a single CSI and corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI
