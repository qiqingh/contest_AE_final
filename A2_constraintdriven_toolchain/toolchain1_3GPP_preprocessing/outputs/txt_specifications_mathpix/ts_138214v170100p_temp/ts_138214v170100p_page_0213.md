to clause 8.1.7, and \( \left(t_{0}^{S L}, t_{1}^{S L}, t_{2}^{S L}, \ldots\right) \) is determined by Clause 8. Here, \( P_{\text {rsvp_TX }} \) is the resource reservation interval indicated by higher layers.
8.1.5A UE procedure for determining slots and resource blocks indicated by a preferred or non-preferred resource set

The set of slots and resource blocks indicated by a set of preferred or non-preferred resource(s) is determined as described below.

The set of preferred or non-preferred resources \( \left\{r_{0}, r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots\right\} \), is indicated by a reference slot \( t_{\text {ref }} \) and \( M \) tuples \( \left(T R I V_{m}, F R I V_{m}, P_{r s v p, m}\right), 1 \leq m \leq M \) indicated by the 'resource combination(s)' field, where for each tuple \( T R I V_{m} \) is indicated by the 9 MSBs , followed by \( F R I V_{m} \) and \( P_{r s v p, m} \) (if present).

The reference slot \( t_{\text {ref }} \) is indicated by the 'reference slot location' field as a combination of DFN index and slot index [5, TS 38.212], with the 10 MSBs indicating the DFN index. \( T R I V_{m} \) and \( F R I V_{m} \) are interpreted according to clause 8.1.5, with the following modifications:
- the value of sl-MaxNumPerReserve is fixed to 3.
- "slot where SCI format 1-A was received" is replaced by slot indicated as the first resource location of a TRIV -
- the first resource location of each \( T R I V_{m} \) for \( m>1 \) is indicated by a slot offset \( t_{m} \) in logical slots with respect to the reference slot \( t_{\text {ref }} \); the first resource location of \( T R I V_{1} \) is at slot offset 0 with respect to the reference slot-
"the received SCI format 1-A, except the resource in the slot where SCI format 1-A was received" is replaced by "each tuple"
- the starting sub-channel \( n_{\text {subCH } 0}^{\text {start }} \) of the first resource of each tuple is separately indicated.

The starting sub-channel \( n_{\text {sub } \mathrm{CH}, 0}^{\text {start }} \) of the first resource of each tuple is indicated by the '[lowest subchannel index for the first resource location of each TRIV]' field. The resource reservation period \( P_{r s v p, m} \) is encoded as in SCI format 1-A.

If the set is indicated by an SCI format 2-C, the number of tuples is \( M=2 \).
A UE forms the union of the subsets indicated by each tuple ( \( T R I V_{m}, F R I V_{m}, P_{r s v p, m} \) ) to obtain the set \( \left\{r_{0}, r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots\right\} \).
[When a preferred resource set is indicated by an SCI format 2-C, if the transmission of the set was triggered by an explicit request, the value of the resource reservation interval \( P_{r s v p, m} \) is set to 0 .]
8.1.6 Sidelink congestion control in sidelink resource allocation mode 2

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter sl-CR-Limit and transmits PSSCH in slot \( n \), the UE shall ensure the following limits for any priority value k ;
\[
\sum_{i \geq k} C R(i) \leq C R_{\text {Limit }}(k)
\]
where \( C R(i) \) is the CR evaluated in slot \( n-N \) for the PSSCH transmissions with 'Priority' field in the SCI set to \( i \), and \( C R_{\text {Limit }}(k) \) corresponds to the high layer parameter sl-CR-Limit that is associated with the priority value \( k \) and the CBR range which includes the CBR measured in slot \( n-N \), where \( N \) is the congestion control processing time.

The congestion control processing time \( N \) is based on \( \mu \) of Table 8.1.6-1 and Table 8.1.6-2 for UE processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where \( \mu \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the sidelink channel with which the PSSCH is to be transmitted. A UE shall only apply a single processing time capability in sidelink congestion control.
