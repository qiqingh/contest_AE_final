The UE may be configured by the higher layer parameter resourceMapping in SRS-Resource with an SRS resource occupying \( N_{s} \in\{1,2,4\} \) adjacent OFDM symbols within the last 6 symbols of the slot, or at any symbol location within the slot if resourceMapping-r 16 is provided subject to UE capability, where all antenna ports of the SRS resources are mapped to each symbol of the resource. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRSPosResourceSet the higher layer parameter resourceMapping-r 16 in SRS-PosResource indicates an SRS resource occupying \( N_{S} \in\{1,2,4,8,12\} \) adjacent symbols anywhere within the slot. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet, the higher layer parameter resourceMapping-r 17 in SRS-Resource indicates an SRS resource occupying \( N_{S} \in\{1,2,4,8,10,12,14\} \) adjacent symbols anywhere within the slot.

If a PUSCH with a priority index 0 and SRS configured by SRS-Resource are transmitted in the same slot on a serving cell, the UE may only be configured to transmit SRS after the transmission of the PUSCH and the corresponding DMRS.

If a PUSCH transmission with a priority index 1 or a PUCCH transmission with a priority index 1 would overlap in time with an SRS transmission on a serving cell, the UE does not transmit the SRS in the overlapping symbol(s).

For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'periodic':
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing', or 'ssb-IndexNcell', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo, spatialRelationInfo-PDC or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-spatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRSResource and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo-PDC contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRSPDC', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS for RTT-based propagation delay compensation according to clause 9 .

For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'semi-persistent':
- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of [10, TS 38.321], for an SRS resource, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions on SRS transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {sub frame }}{ }^{\mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The activation command also contains spatial relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal [Ds, one per element of the activated SRS resource set. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet, each ID in the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, each [D in the list of reference signal [Ds may refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell indicated by PCI field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource configured on serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID field and Resource BWP ID field in the activation command if present, same serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a \( d l- \) PRS-ID indicated by DL-PRS ID field in the activation command.
- if an SRS resource in the activated resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos, the UE shall assume that the ID of the reference signal in the activation command overrides the one configured in spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos.
