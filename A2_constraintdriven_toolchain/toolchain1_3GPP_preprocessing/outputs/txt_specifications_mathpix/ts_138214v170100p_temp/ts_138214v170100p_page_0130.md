A first CSI report is said to have priority over second CSI report if the associated \( \operatorname{Pri}_{i C S}(y, k, c, s) \) value is lower for the first report than for the second report.

Two CSI reports are said to collide if the time occupancy of the physical channels scheduled to carry the CSI reports overlap in at least one OFDM symbol and are transmitted on the same carrier. When a UE is configured to transmit two colliding CSI reports,
- if \( y \) values are different between the two CSI reports, the following rules apply except for the case when one of the \( y \) value is 2 and the other \( y \) value is 3 (for CSI reports transmitted on PUSCH, as described in Clause 5.2.3; for CSI reports transmitted on PUCCH, as described in Clause 5.2.4):
- The CSI report with higher \( \operatorname{Pri}_{i C S}(y, k, c, s) \) value shall not be sent by the UE.
- otherwise, the two CSI reports are multiplexed or either is dropped based on the priority values, as described in Clause 9.2.5.2 in [6, TS 38.213].

If a semi-persistent CSI report to be carried on PUSCH overlaps in time with PUSCH data transmission in one or more symbols on the same carrier, and if the earliest symbol of these PUSCH channels starts no earlier than \( \mathrm{N}_{2}+\mathrm{d}_{2,1} \) symbols after the last symbol of the DCI scheduling the PUSCH where \( \mathrm{d}_{2,1} \) is the maximum of the \( \mathrm{d}_{2,1} \) associated with the PUSCH carrying semi-persistent CSI report and the PUSCH with data transmission, the CSI report shall not be transmitted by the UE. Otherwise, if the timeline requirement is not satisfied this is an error case.

If a UE would transmit a first PUSCH that includes semi-persistent CSI reports and a second PUSCH that includes an UL-SCH and the first PUSCH transmission would overlap in time with the second PUSCH transmission, the UE does not transmit the first PUSCH and transmits the second PUSCH. The UE expects that the first and second PUSCH transmissions satisfy the above timing conditions for PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time when at least one of the first or second PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE.
5.3 UE PDSCH processing procedure time

If the first uplink symbol of the PUCCH which carries the HARQ-ACK information, as defined by the assigned HARQACK timing \( K_{/} \)and \( K_{o} \) olset, if configured, and the PUCCH resource to be used and including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol \( L_{t} \), where \( L_{t} \) is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting after \( T_{\text {puc } 1}=\left(N_{1}+d_{1,1}+d_{2}\right)(2048+144) \cdot \kappa 2^{-\mu} \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}+T_{\text {est }} \) after the end of the last symbol of the PDSCH carrying the TB being acknowledged, then the UE shall provide a valid HARQ-ACK message.
- \( \quad N_{1} \) is based on \( \mu \) of table 5.3-1 and table 5.3-2 for UE processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where \( \mu \) corresponds to the one of ( \( \mu_{P D C C H}, \mu_{P D S C H}, \mu_{U L} \) ) resulting with the largest \( T_{\text {proc. }} \), where the \( \mu_{P D C C H} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH, the \( \mu_{P O S C H} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the scheduled PDSCH, and \( \mu_{u l} \) corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the uplink channel with which the HARQ-ACK is assumed to be transmitted regardless of whether or not the PDSCH reception provides a transport block for a HARQ process with disabled HARQ-ACK information as indicated by HARQ-feedbackEnabling-disablingperHARQprocess, if provided, and \( \kappa \) is defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211].
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, \( T_{e x} \) is calculated according to [4, TS 38.211], otherwise \( T_{e x} =0 \).
- If the PDSCH DM-RS position \( l_{1} \) for the additional DM-RS in Table 7.4.1.1.2-3 in clause 7.4.1.1.2 of [4, TS 38.211] is \( l_{1}=12 \) then \( N_{t, 0}=14 \) in Table 5-3-1, otherwise \( N_{t, 0}=13 \).
- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the first uplink symbol which carries the HARQ-ACK information further includes the effect of timing difference between the component carriers as given in [11, TS 38.133].
- For the PDSCH mapping type A as given in clause 7.4.1.1 of [4, TS 38.211]: if the last symbol of PDSCH is on the \( i \)-th symbol of the slot where \( i<7 \), then \( d_{l, l}=7-i \), otherwise \( d_{l, l}=0 \)
- If a PUCCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH/PUSCH of a smaller priority index, \( d_{2} \) for the PUCCH of a larger priority is set as reported by the UE; otherwise \( d_{2}=0 \).
