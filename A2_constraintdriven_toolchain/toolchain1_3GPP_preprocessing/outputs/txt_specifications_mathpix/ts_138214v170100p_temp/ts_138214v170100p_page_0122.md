5.2.2.4 Channel State Information - Interference Measurement (CSI-IM)

The UE can be configured with one or more CSI-[M resource set configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameter CSI-IM-ResourceSet. Each CSI-[M resource set consists of \( K \geq 1 \) CSI-[M resource(s).

The following parameters are configured via higher layer parameter CSI-IM-Resource for each CSI-IM resource configuration:
- csi-IM-Resourceld determines CSI-IM resource configuration identity
- subcarrierLocation-p0 or subcarrierLocation-pl defines subcarrier occupancy of the CSI-[M resource within a slot for csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern set to 'pattern0' or 'pattern1', respectively.
- symbolLocation-p0 or symbolLocation-pl defines OFDM symbol location of the CSI-[M resource within a slot for csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern set to 'pattern0' or 'pattern1', respectively.
- periodicityAndOffset defines the CSI-[M periodicity and slot offset for periodic/semi-persistent CSI-[M.
- freqBand includes parameters to enable configuration of frequency-occupancy of CSI-[M

In each of the PRBs configured by freqBand, the UE shall assume each CSI-[M resource is located in,
- resource elements \( \left(k_{C S I-M}, l_{C S I-M}\right),\left(k_{C S I-M}, l_{C S I-M}+1\right),\left(k_{C S I-M}+1, l_{C S I-M}\right) \) and \( \left(k_{C S I-M}+1, l_{C S I-M}+1\right) \), if csi-M-ResourceElementPattern is set to 'pattern0',
- resource elements \( \left(k_{C S I-M}, l_{C S I-M}\right),\left(k_{C S I-M}+1, l_{C S I-M}\right),\left(k_{C S I-M}+2, l_{C S I-M}\right) \) and \( \left(k_{C S I-M}+3, l_{C S-I M}\right) \) if csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern is set to 'pattern1',
where \( k_{C S I-M} \) and \( l_{C S I-M} \) are the configured frequency-domain location and time-domain location, respectively, given by the higher layer parameters in the above list.
5.2.2.5 CSI reference resource definition

The CSI reference resource for a serving cell is defined as follows:
- In the frequency domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by the group of downlink physical resource blocks corresponding to the band to which the derived CSI relates.
- In the time domain, the CSI reference resource for a CSI reporting in uplink slot \( n \) ' is defined by a single downlink slot \( n-n_{\text {CSI_ref }}-K_{\text {offset }} \cdot \frac{{ }^{\mu^{\mu_{D L}}}}{2^{\mu_{K_{\text {Offet }}}}} \), where \( K_{\text {offset }} \) is a parameter configured by higher layer as specified in clause 4.2 of [ 6 TS 38.213], and where \( \mu_{K_{\text {offset }}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( K_{\text {offset }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 ,
- where \( n=\left\lfloor n^{\prime} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{D L}}}{2^{\mu_{L L}}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\left(\frac{N_{\text {slot }, \text { offset }, U L}^{\text {CA }}}{2^{\mu_{\text {offset }, U L}}}-\frac{N_{\text {slot }, \text { offset }, D L}^{\text {CA }}}{2^{\mu_{\text {offset }, D L}}}\right) \cdot 2^{\mu_{D L}}\right\rfloor \) and \( \mu_{D L} \) and \( \mu_{U L} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for DL and UL, respectively, and \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offsel }} \) are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cells transmitting the uplink and downlink, as defined in clause 4.5 of [4, TS 38.211]
- where for periodic and semi-persistent CSI reporting
- if a single CSI-RS/SSB resource is configured for channel measurement \( n_{C S I_{-} r e f} \) is the smallest value greater than or equal to \( 4 \cdot 2^{\mu_{D L}} \), such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot, or
- if multiple CSI-RS/SSB resources are configured for channel measurement \( n_{C S I_{-} \text {ref }} \) is the smallest value greater than or equal to \( 5 \cdot 2^{\mu_{L L}} \), such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot.
- where for aperiodic CSI reporting, if the UE is indicated by the DCI to report CSI in the same slot as the CSI request, \( n_{C S t_{-} r e f} \) is such that the reference resource is in the same valid downlink slot as the corresponding CSI
