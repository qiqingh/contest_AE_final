The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH assigned by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI with a TBS exceeding 2976 bits.

For a UE configured with the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'fdmSchemeB' and indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the TBS determination follows the steps 1-4 with the following modification in Step 1: a UE determines the total number of REs allocated for PDSCH ( \( N_{R E} \) ) by \( N_{R E}=\min \left(156, N_{R E}^{\prime}\right) \cdot n_{p R B} \), where \( n_{P R B} \) is the total number of allocated PRBs corresponding to the first TCI state, and the determined TBS of PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the first TCI state is also applied to the PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the second TCI state. For a UE configured with the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' and indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', the TBS determination follows the steps 1-4 with the following modification in step 1: a UE determines the number of REs allocated for PDSCH within a PRB ( \( N_{R E}^{\prime} \) ) by \( N_{R E}^{\prime}=N_{s c}^{R B} \cdot N_{s y m b}^{s h}-N_{D M R S}^{P R B}-N_{o h}^{P R B} \), where \( N_{s y m b}^{s h} \) is the number of symbols of the PDSCH allocation within the slot corresponding to the first TCI state, and the determined TBS of PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the first TCI state is also applied to the PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the second TCI state.

For the PDSCH assigned by a PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI, MsgBRNTI, TBS determination follows the steps 1-4 with the following modification in step 2: a scaling \( N_{\text {info }}=S \cdot N_{R E} \cdot R \cdot Q_{m} \cdot v \) is applied in the calculation of \( N_{\text {info }} \), where the scaling factor is determined based on the \( T B \) scaling field in the DCI as in Table 5.1.3.2-2.
