If the \( \mu_{\mathrm{PDCCH}}>\mu_{\mathrm{PDSCH}} \), the UE is expected to receive the scheduled PDSCH, if the first symbol in the PDSCH allocation, including the DM-RS, as defined by the slot offset \( K_{0} \) and the start and length indicator SLIV of the scheduling DCI starts no earlier than \( N_{\text {pasch }} \) PDCCH symbols after the end of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH, not taking into account the effect of receive timing difference between the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining \( N_{\text {pasch }} \), the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used.

6 Physical uplink shared channel related procedure
6.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical uplink shared channel

PUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer parameter of configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant without the detection of an UL grant in a DCL. The configured grant Type 2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a valid activation DCI according to clause 10.2 of [6, TS 38.213] after the reception of higher layer parameter configuredGrantConfig not including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant. If configured GrantConfigToAddModList is configured, more than one configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP of a serving cell.

The UE can be configured with a list of up to 64 UL-TCIState configurations within the higher layer parameter BWPUplinkDedicated. Each UL-TCIState configuration contains a parameter for configuring one reference signal, if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a CC, and SRS.

For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) or \( 0 \_1 \), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubset, maxRank, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, which are provided by pusch-Config. For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by configuredGrantConfig except for dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH, txConfig, codebookSubsetDCI-0-2, maxRankDCI-0-2, scaling of UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationTypelGranularityDCI-0-2 provided by pusch-Config. If the UE is provided with transformPrecoder in configured GrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter tp-pi2BPSK, if provided in pusch-Config, according to the procedure described in clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a configured grant. When the UE is configured DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter or the RS configured with qclType set to 'typeD' of the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJointTCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.
