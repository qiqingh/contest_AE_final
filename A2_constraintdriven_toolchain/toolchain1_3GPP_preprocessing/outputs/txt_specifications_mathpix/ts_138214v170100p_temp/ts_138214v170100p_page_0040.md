5.1.4 PDSCH resource mapping

When receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system information indicator in DCI is set to 0 , the UE shall assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used by the UE for a reception of the PDSCH.

When receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system information indicator in DCI is set to 1 , RARNTI, MSGB-RNTI, P-RNTI or TC-RNTI, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssbPositionsInBurst, and if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted.

A UE expects a configuration provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon to be same as a configuration provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIBI.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI or PDSCHs with SPS, the REs corresponding to the configured or dynamically indicated resources in Clauses 5.1.4.1, 5.1.4.2 are not available for PDSCH. Furthermore, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources, and the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted.

A UE is not expected to handle the case where PDSCH DM-RS REs are overlapping, even partially, with any RE(s) not available for PDSCH.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SS/PBCH block transmission according to ssb-PositionsInBurst represents all of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks corresponding to SS/PBCH block indices provided by ssbPositionsInBurst as described in Clause 4.1 of [6, TS 38.213].
5.1.4.1 PDSCH resource mapping with RB symbol level granularity

The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _ 1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1_2, by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternGrouplDCI-1-2, rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 instead of rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup2.

The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \ldots 0 \) described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4_1, and the procedures for PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 4 _ 2 by applying the parameters of rateMatchPatternToAddModList, rateMatchPatternGroupl and rateMatchPatternGroup 2 configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast.

A UE may be configured with any of the following higher layer parameters indicating REs declared as not available for PDSCH:
- rateMatchPatternToAddModList given by PDSCH-Config, by ServingCellConfig or by ServingCellConfigCommon, or by PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MTCH and configuring up to 4 RateMatchPattern(s) per BWP and up to 4 RateMatchPattern(s) per serving-cell. The RateMatchPattern(s) configured for MBS broadcast is counted into the ones that are configured per serving-cell. A RateMatchPattern may contain:
- within a BWP, when provided by PDSCH-Config or within a serving cell when provided by ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon, or by PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MTCH, a pair of reserved resources with numerology provided by higher layer parameter subcarrierSpacing given by RateMatchPattern when configured per serving cell or by numerology of associated BWP when configured per BWP. The pair of reserved resources are respectively indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter resourceBlocks given by RateMatchPattern) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters symbolsInResourceBlock given by RateMatchPattern) for which the reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for PDSCH . For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by RateMatchPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair is present in the unit. The periodicityAndPattern can be \( \{1,2,4,5,8,10,20 \) or 40\( \} \) units long, but maximum of 40 msec . The first symbol of periodicityAndPattern every \( 40 \mathrm{msec} / \mathrm{P} \) periods is a first symbol in frame \( n_{f} \bmod 4=0 \), where P is
