- REs indicated by the 'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS' in lte-CRS-ToMatchAround in ServingCellConfig or ServingCellConfigCommon configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for PDSCH.
- REs indicated by 'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS' in lte-CRS-PatternList l-r l 6 in ServingCellConfig configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for PDSCH.
- For the UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE modes for broadcast reception, REs indicated by 'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS' in PDSCH-Config-MCCH or PDSCH-Config-MCCH configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for PDSCH.
- Each RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS configuration contains v-Shift consisting of LTE-CRS-vshift(s), nrofCRS-Ports consisting of LTE-CRS antenna ports 1, 2 or 4 ports, carrierFreqDL representing the offset in units of 15 kHz subcarriers from (reference) point A to the LTE carrier centre subcarrier location, carrierBandwidthDL representing the LTE carrier bandwidth, and may also configure mbsfn-SubframeConfigList representing MBSFN subframe configuration. A UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause 6.10.1.2 in [15, TS 36.211], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe.
- If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet and is also configured by the higher layer parameter Ite-CRS-PatternListl-r 16 and Ite-CRS-PatternList2-r16 in ServingCellConfig, the following REs are declared as not available for PDSCH:
- if the UE is configured with crs-RateMatch-PerCoresetPoollndex, REs indicated by the CRS pattern(s) in Ite-CRS-PatternList 1-r16 if the PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 0 ', or the CRS pattern(s) in lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16 if PDSCH is associated with coresetPoollndex set to ' 1 ';
- otherwise, REs indicated by lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16 and lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16, in ServingCellConfig-
- Within a BWP, the UE can be configured with one or more ZP CSI-RS resource set configuration(s) for aperiodic, semi-persistent and periodic time-domain behaviours (higher layer parameters aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList, sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList and \( p \)-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet respectively comprised in PDSCH-Config), with each ZP CSI-RS resource set consisting of at most 16 ZP CSIRS resources (higher layer parameter ZP-CSI-RS-Resource) in numerology of the BWP. The REs indicated by \( p \) -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are declared as not available for PDSCH. The REs indicated by sp-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSetsToAddModList and aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList are declared as not available for PDSCH when their triggering and activation are applied, respectively. The following parameters are configured via higher layer signaling for each ZP CSI-RS resource configuration:
- zp-CSI-RS-Resourceld in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource determines ZP CSI-RS resource configuration identity.
- nrofPorts in CSI-RS-ResourceMapping defines the number of CSI-RS ports, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211].
- cdm-Type in CSI-RS-ResourceMapping defines CDM values and pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211].
- resourceMapping in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines the OFDM symbol and subcarrier occupancy of the ZP CSI-RS resource within a slot that are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of [4, TS 38.211].
- periodicityAndOffset in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines the ZP-CSI-RS periodicity and slot offset for periodic/semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS.
- For the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode for multicast reception, \( p-Z P \)-CSI-RS-ResourceSet can be configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast for GC-PDSCH rate matching, subject to UE capability. The REs indicated by \( p \) -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are declared as not available for GC-PDSCH. The REs indicated by \( p \)-ZP-CSI-RSResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config for unicast do not apply for GC-PDSCH and the REs indicated by \( p \) -ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast for multicast do not apply for unicast PDSCH. The total number of periodic ZP-CSI-RS-Resources that a UE can be configured with is the same as for unicast in Rel-16. If p-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet is configured in both PDSCH-Config and PDSCH-Config-Multicast, it is subject to UE capability whether the \( p \)-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config-Multicast can be different from the \( p \)-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured in PDSCH-Config-
