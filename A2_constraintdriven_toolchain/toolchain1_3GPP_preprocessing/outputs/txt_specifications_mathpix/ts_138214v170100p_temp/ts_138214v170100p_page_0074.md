corresponding csi-IM-ResourceSet (if configured) or ( \( k+1 \) )-th entry of associated \( n z p \)-CSI-RS-Resources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet (if configured) for interference measurement.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMICQI', ' cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', then the UE is not expected to be configured with more than 8 CSI-RS resources in a CSI-RS resource set contained within a resource setting that is linked to the CSIReportConfig.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'criSINR', 'none', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'cri-SINR-Capability[Set]Index and the CSI-ReportConfig is linked to a resource setting configured with the higher layer parameter resourceType set to 'aperiodic', then the UE is not expected to be configured with more than 16 CSI-RS resources in a CSI-RS resource set contained within the resource setting.

The LI indicates which column of the precoder matrix of the reported PMI corresponds to the strongest layer of the codeword corresponding to the largest reported wideband CQI. If two wideband CQIs are reported and have equal value, the LI corresponds to strongest layer of the first codeword. If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-L-PMI-CQI' and the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement is configured with two Resource Groups and \( N \) Resource Pairs, and the UE reports a CRI associated to a Resource Pair, and a rank combination \( \left\{v_{1}, v_{2}\right\} \), the first LI indicates which column of the precoder matrix of the first reported PMI corresponds to the strongest of the first \( v_{1} \) layers of the codeword and the second LI indicates which column of the precoder matrix of the second reported PMI corresponds to the strongest of the last \( v_{2} \) layers of the codeword.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-RI-i1', 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', 'cri-RI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', the UE shall derive:
- the CSI parameters without averaging two or more instances of any periodic or semi-persistent \( n z p \)-CSI-RSResources in the corresponding NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for channel measurement or for interference measurement located in different DL transmissions,
- the instances of the \( n z p \)-CSI-RS-Resources are not in the same channel occupancy duration indicated by DCI format 2 0, if the UE is provided at least one of SlotFormatIndicator or co-DurationList; or occupied by PDSCH(s) and/or aperiodic CSI-RS(s) indicated by DCI formats, if any, and the corresponding PDCCH(s), if the UE is neither provided with CO-DurationPerCell nor SlotFormatIndicator, but is provided with csi-RS-ValidationWith-DCI
- the interference measurements for computing CSI value based on periodic/semi-persistent CSI-IM measured only in OFDM symbol(s) that fulfill the same conditions under which the UE is expected to receive periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS as described in Clause 11.1 and Clause 11.1.1 of [6, TS 38.213].

If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter [NumberOfAdditionalPCI], the UE is allowed to report in a single reporting instance up to four SSBRIs for each report setting, where SSB resources are associated with PCI indices referring to the PCI of the serving cell and \( \mathrm{PCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) different from the PCl of the serving cell within the set of PCIs configured.
5.2.1.4.3 L1-RSRP Reporting

For L1-RSRP computation
- the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resources, SS/PBCH Block resources or both CSI-RS and SS/PBCH block resources, when resource-wise quasi co-located with 'type \( C \) ' and 'typeD' when applicable.
- the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting up to 16 CSI-RS resource sets having up to 64 resources within each set. The total number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more than 128.

For L1-RSRP reporting, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS in CSI-ReportConfig is configured to be one, the reported L1-RSRP value is defined by a 7 -bit value in the range \( [-140,-44] \mathrm{dBm} \) with 1 dB step size, if the higher layer parameter nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting is configured as 'enabled', or if the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting-r 17 is configured, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting, where the largest measured value of L1-RSRP is quantized to a 7 -bit value in the range \( [-140,-44] \mathrm{dBm} \) with 1 dB step size, and the differential L 1 -RSRP is quantized to
