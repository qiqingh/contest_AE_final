For TB processing over multiple slots:
- For unpaired spectrum, the same symbol allocation is applied across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall transmit the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission, applying the same symbol allocation in each slot.
- For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the same symbol allocation is applied across the \( N \cdot K \) consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall transmit the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot.
- For the case of reduced capability half-duplex UE, [and when AvailableSlotCounting is enabled,] the same symbol allocation is applied across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall transmit the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission, applying the same symbol allocation in each slot.

For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), or \( 0 \_2 \), or \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the redundancy version to be applied on the \( n \)th transmission occasion of the TB, where \( n=0,1, \ldots N \cdot K-1 \), is determined according to table 6.1.2.1-2.

For a PUSCH transmission of a PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by RAR UL grant, the redundancy version to be applied on the \( n \)th transmission occasion of the TB, where \( n=0,1, \ldots N \cdot K-1 \), is determined according to the first row of Table 6.1.2.1-2.

When transmitting MsgA PUSCH on a non-initial UL BWP, if the UE is configured with startSymbolAndLengthMsgA\( P O \), the UE shall determine the \( S \) and \( L \) from startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO.

When transmitting MsgA PUSCH, if the UE is not configured with startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, and if the TDRA list PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList is provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon, the UE shall use msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation to indicate which values are used in the list. If PUSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList is not provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon, the UE shall use parameters \( S \) and \( L \) from table 6.1.2.1.1-2 or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 where msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation indicates which values are used in the list. The time offset for PUSCH transmission is described in [6, TS 38.213].

For PUSCH repetition Type A and TB processing over multiple slots, a PUSCH transmission in a slot of a multi-slot PUSCH transmission is omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 17.2 of [6, TS 38.213].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, except for PUSCH transmitting CSI report(s) with no transport block, the number of nominal repetitions is given by numberOfRepetitions. For the \( n \)-th nominal repetition, \( n=0, \ldots \), numberOfRepetitions 1,
- The slot where the nominal repetition starts is given by \( K_{s}+\left\lfloor\frac{S+n \cdot L}{N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }}}\right\rfloor \), and the starting symbol relative to the start of the slot is given by \( \bmod \left(S+n \cdot L, N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {stot }}\right) \).
