When the UE is scheduled to transmit a PUSCH with no transport block and with a CSI report(s) by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the 'Time domain resource assignment' field value \( m \) of the DCI provides a row index \( m+1 \) to the allocated table as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the start symbol \( S \) and the allocation length \( L \), and the PUSCH mapping type to be applied in the PUSCH transmission and the \( K_{2} \) value is determined as \( K_{2}=\max _{j} Y_{j}(m+1) \), where \( Y_{j}, j=0, \ldots, N_{\text {Rep }}-1 \) are the corresponding list entries of the higher layer parameter
- reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2, if PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) and reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2 is configured;
- reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1, if PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1 is configured;
- reportSlotOffsetList, otherwise;
in CSI-ReportConfig for the \( N_{\text {Rep }} \) triggered CSI Reporting Settings and \( Y_{,}(m+1) \) is the ( \( m+1 \) )th entry of \( Y_{j} \).
- The slot \( K_{s} \) where the UE shall transmit the PUSCH is determined by \( K_{2} \) as \( K_{s}= \) at least one of the scheduled and scheduling cell, \( K_{s}=\left\lfloor n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {PUSCH }}}}{2^{\mu_{\text {PDCCH }}}}\right\rfloor+K_{2}+K_{\text {offset }} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu_{\text {PUSCH }}}}{2^{\mu_{K}} \text { offset }} \), otherwise, where \( K_{\text {offset }} \) is a parameter configured by higher layer as specified in clause 4.2 of [6 TS 38.213], and where \( \mu_{K_{\text {offset }}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( K_{\text {offset }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range \( 1, n \) is the slot with the scheduling DCI, \( \mathrm{K}_{2} \) is based on the numerology of PUSCH, \( \mu_{\text {PUSCH }} \) and \( \mu_{\text {PDCCH }} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for PUSCH and PDCCH, respectively, and the scheduling DCI is other than DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI.
- \( \quad N_{\text {slot, offset, PDCCH }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PDCCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higherlayer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell receiving the PDCCH, \( N_{\text {slot, }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) offset, PUSCH and \( \mu_{\text {offset, PUSCH }} \) are the \( N_{\text {slot, }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \) offset and the \( \mu_{\text {offset }} \), respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cell transmitting the PUSCH, as defined in clause 4.5 of [4, TS 38.211], and
- for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0_1, if pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1 is set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', the UE applies PUSCH repetition Type B procedure when determining the time domain resource allocation. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), if pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2 is set to 'pusch-RepTypeB', the UE applies PUSCH repetition Type B procedure when determining the time domain resource allocation. Otherwise, the UE applies PUSCH repetition Type A procedure when determining the time domain resource allocation for PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH, by RAR UL grant, or by fallbackRAR UL grant.
- for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), if numberOfSlotsTBoMS is present and larger than 1 , the UE applies TB processing over multiple slots procedure when determining the time domain resource allocation.
- For PUSCH repetition Type A and TB processing over multiple slots, the starting symbol \( S \) relative to the start of the slot, and the number of consecutive symbols \( L \) counting from the symbol \( S \) allocated for the PUSCH are determined from the start and length indicator SLIV of the indexed row:
if \( (L-1) \leq 7 \) then
\[
S L I V=14 \cdot(L-1)+S
\]
else
\[
S L I V=14 \cdot(14-L+1)+(14-1-S)
\]
where \( 0<L \leq 14-S \), and
