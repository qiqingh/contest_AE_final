ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)
- If uplinkTxSwitching-2T-Mode is configured, when the UE is to transmit a 2-port transmission on one uplink carrier on one band and if the preceding uplink transmission is a 2 -port transmission on another uplink carrier on another band, then the UE is not expected to transmit for the duration of \( N_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \) on any of the carriers.
- The UE is not expected to be scheduled or configured with uplink transmissions that result in simultaneous transmission on two antenna ports on one uplink carrier on one band, and any transmission on another uplink carrier on another band.
- In all other cases the UE is expected to transmit normally all uplink transmissions without interruptions.
6.1.6.2.1 void
6.1.6.3 Uplink switching for supplementary uplink

For a UE indicating a capability for uplink switching with BandCombination-UplinkTxSwitch for a band combination, and if it is for that band combination configured in a serving cell with two uplink carriers with higher layer parameter supplementaryUplink:
- If the UE is configured with uplink switching with parameter uplinkTxSwitching,
- If the UE is to transmit any uplink channel or signal on a different uplink on a different band from the preceding transmission occasion based on \( \mathrm{DCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) received before \( \boldsymbol{T}_{0}-\boldsymbol{T}_{\text {offset }} \) or based on a higher layer configuration(s), then the UE assumes that an uplink switching is triggered in a duration of switching gap \( \boldsymbol{N}_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \), where \( \boldsymbol{T}_{0} \) is the start time of the first symbol of the transmission occasion of the uplink channel or signal and \( \boldsymbol{T}_{\text {offset }} \) is the preparation procedure time of the transmission occasion of the uplink channel or signal given in clause 5.3, clause 5.4, clause 6.2.1, clause 6.4 and in clause 9 of [6, TS 38.213], respectively. During the switching gap \( \boldsymbol{N}_{\mathrm{Tx} 1-\mathrm{Tx} 2} \), the UE is not expected to transmit on any of the two uplinks.
- In all other cases the UE is expected to transmit normally all uplink transmissions without interruptions.
6.1.7 UE procedure for determining time domain windows for bundling DM-RS

For PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, PUSCH repetition Type B and TB processing over multiple slots, when PUSCH-DMRSBundling is enabled, and for PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, when PUCCH-DMRS-Bundling is enabled, the UE determines one or multiple nominal TDWs, as follows:
- For PUSCH transmissions of repetition Type A, PUSCH repetition Type B and TB processing over multiple slots, the duration of each nominal TDW except the last nominal TDW, in number of consecutive slots, is:
- Given by PUSCH-TimeDomainWindow Length, if configured.
- Computed as min ([maxDMRS-BundlingDuration], M), if PUSCH-TimeDomainWindowLength is not configured, where M is the time duration in consecutive slots of \( N \cdot K \) PUSCH transmissions, and where:
- For PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type \( \mathrm{A}, \mathrm{N}=1 \) and K is the number of repetitions, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.
- For PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type \( \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{N}=1 \) and K is the number of nominal repetitions, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.
- For PUSCH transmissions of TB processing over multiple slots, N is the number of slots used for TBS determination and K is the number of repetitions of the number of slots N used for TBS determination, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.
- For PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, the duration of each nominal TDW except the last nominal TDW, in number of consecutive slots, is:
- Given by PUCCH-TimeDomainWindow Length, if configured.
- Computed as min ([maxDMRS-BundlingDuration], M), if PUCCH-TimeDomainWindowLength is not configured, where \( M \) is the time duration in consecutive slots from the first slot determined for PUCCH
