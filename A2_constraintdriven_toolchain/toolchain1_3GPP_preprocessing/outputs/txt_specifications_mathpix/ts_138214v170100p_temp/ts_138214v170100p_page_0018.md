SPS-Config-Multicast if configured, or 1 otherwise, consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_0 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-RNTI for MTCH, if the UE is configured with pdschAggregationFactor in the pdsch-Config-MTCH, the same symbol allocation is applied across the pdschAggregationFactor consecutive slots.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI for multicast reception or G-RNTI, if the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' indicates an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation in the PDSCH-Config-Multicast or PDSCH-Config-Broadcast, the same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the repetitionNumber consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using associated SPS-Config-Multicast and activated by DCI in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by G-CS-RNTI for multicast reception, if the DCI field 'Time domain resource assignment' of the activating DCI indicates an entry which contains repetitionNumber in PDSCHTimeDomainResourceAllocation in the PDSCH-Config-Multicast, the same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the repetitionNumber consecutive slots.

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber or if the UE is configured by repetitionScheme set to one of' fdmSchemeA', ' fdmSchemeB' and 'tdmSchemeA', the UE does not expect to be configured with pdschAggregationFactor for the same PDSCH.

If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH, the UE does not expect to be configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber in pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17.

If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE does not apply pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-config, if configured, to DCI format 1_1 on the DL BWP of the serving cell.

If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r I 7 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, when any two DL DCIs end in the same symbol and at least one of the DCIs schedules multiple PDSCHs, the UE does not expect that the scheduled PDSCH(s) by the two DCIs have overlapping spans, where the span associated with a DCI is defined from the beginning of the first scheduled PDSCH or up to the end of the last scheduled PDSCH.

A PDSCH reception in a slot of a multi-slot PDSCH reception is omitted according to the conditions in clause 11.1 and clause 17.2 of [6, TS38.213].

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot, if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was not contained within the first three symbols of the slot. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], if the two PDCCH candidates scheduling the PDSCH with mapping Type A were received in the same slot as the PDSCH, both PDCCH candidates are expected to be contained within the first three symbols of the slot.

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot, if the first symbol of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in a later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain resource allocation. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot, if the first symbol of the PDCCH candidate that starts later in time scheduling the PDSCH was received in a later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain resource allocation.

When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetKO in an active DL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_1 \), the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator'
