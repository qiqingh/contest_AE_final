- The ratio of PDSCH EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE is as given in Clause 5.2.2.3.1.
- Assume no REs allocated for NZP CSI-RS and ZP CSI-RS.
- Assume the same number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols as the maximum front-loaded symbols configured by the higher layer parameter maxLength in DMRS-DownlinkConfig.
- Assume the same number of additional DM-RS symbols as the additional symbols configured by the higher layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition.
- Assume the PDSCH symbols are not containing DM-RS.
- Assume PRB bundling size of 2 PRBs.
- The PDSCH transmission scheme where the UE may assume that PDSCH transmission would be performed with up to 8 transmission layers as defined in Clause 7.3.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. For CQI calculation, the UE should assume that PDSCH signals on antenna ports in the set \( [1000, \ldots, 1000+v-1] \) for \( v \) layers would result in signals equivalent to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \( [3000, \ldots, 3000+P-1] \), as given by
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y^{(3000)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
y^{(3000+P-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]=W(i)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x^{(0)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
x^{(v-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \( x(i)=\left[x^{(0)}(i) \ldots x^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{T} \) is a vector of PDSCH symbols from the layer mapping defined in Clause 7.3.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211], \( P \in[1,2,4,8,12,16,24,32] \) is the number of CSI-RS ports. If only one CSI-RS port is configured, \( W(i) \) is 1 . If the higher layer parameter reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig for which the CQI is reported is set to either 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', W(i) is the precoding matrix corresponding to the reported PMI applicable to \( x(i) \). If the higher layer parameter reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig for which the CQI is reported is set to 'cri-RI-CQI', \( W(i) \) is the precoding matrix corresponding to the procedure described in Clause 5.2.1.4.2. If the higher layer parameter reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig for which the CQI is reported is set to 'cri-RI-i1-CQI', \( W(i) \) is the precoding matrix corresponding to the reported il according to the procedure described in Clause 5.2.1.4.2. The corresponding PDSCH signals transmitted on antenna ports \( [3000, \ldots, 3000+P-1] \) would have a ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE equal to the ratio given in Clause 5.2.2.3.1. If the higher layer parameter reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig for which the CQI is reported is set to either 'cri-RI-PMI-CQI' or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement is configured with two Resource Groups and \( N \) Resource Pairs, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.1, the reported CRI corresponds to an entry of the \( N \) Resource Pairs, and the reported rank combination is \( \left\{v_{1}, v_{2}\right\} \), as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2, for CQI calculation, the UE should assume that
- PDSCH signals on antenna ports in the set \( \left[1000, \ldots, 1000+v_{1}-1\right] \) for \( v_{1} \) layers would result in signals equivalent to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \( [3000, \ldots, 3000+P-1] \) of the Group 1 CSI-RS resource in the Resource Pair indicated by the CRI, and PDSCH signals on antenna ports in the set \( \left[1000+v_{1}, \ldots, 1000+v_{1}+v_{2}-1\right] \) for \( v_{2} \) layers would result in signals equivalent to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \( [3000, \ldots, 3000+P-1] \) of the Group 2 CSI-RS resource in the Resource Pair indicated by the CRI, as given by
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
y_{j}^{(3000)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
y_{j}^{(3000+P-1)}(i)
\end{array}\right]=W_{j}(i)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x^{\left((j-1) \cdot v_{1}\right)}(i) \\
\ldots \\
x^{\left(v_{1}+(j-1) \cdot v_{2}-1\right)}(i)
\end{array}\right]
\]
where \( W_{j}(i), j=1,2 \) are the two precoding matrices corresponding to the two reported PMIs applicable to \( x(i) \), as described in clause 5.2 .1 .4 .2 ; and the indices \( j=1,2 \) are associated to the two Resource Groups configured in the corresponding CSI-RS Resource Set for channel measurement; that the signals \( y_{j}, j=1,2 \), fully overlap in time and frequency, and that, for the calculation of RI, PMI and LI (if configured) of \( v_{j} \) layers, \( j=1,2 \), the interference from the other \( v_{(j \bmod 2)+1} \) layers is derived from channel measurement and precoding matrix corresponding to the other \( v_{(j \bmod 2)+1} \) layers.
- The UE shall assume that the corresponding PDSCH signals for \( v_{j} \) layers transmitted on the \( P \) antenna ports of the CSI-RS resource in Group \( j \) would have a ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE equal to the powerControlOffset of the respective CSI-RS resource, for \( j=1,2 \).
