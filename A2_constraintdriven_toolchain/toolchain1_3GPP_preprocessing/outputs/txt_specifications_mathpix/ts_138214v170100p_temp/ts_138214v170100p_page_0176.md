ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

The UE shall maintain power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to frequency hopping, or in response to the use of a different SRS resource set association for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B , or in response to the use of different spatial relations or different power control parameters for the two PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, or in response to any event not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE. The UE maintains power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW, across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, in case the actual TDW is created in response to an event triggered by DCI other than frequency hopping or by MAC-CE, subject to UE capability.
6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure
6.2.1 UE sounding procedure

The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-ResourceSet or SRS-PosResourceSet. For each SRS resource set configured by SRSResourceSet, a UE may be configured with \( K \geq 1 \) SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRS-Resource), where the maximum value of K is indicated by UE capability [13,38.306]. When SRS resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, a UE may be configured with \( K \geq 1 \) SRS resources (higher layer parameter SRSPosResource), where the maximum value of K is 16 . The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet. When the higher layer parameter usage is set to 'beamManagement', only one SRS resource in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.

When the UE is configured DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS resource set configured with followUnifiedTCIstater17, can be configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState or updated as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321]. The reference RS in the DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter \( t r s \)-Info. The reference RS in the UL-TCIState(s) can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.

If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is configured with [followUnifiedTCIstate-r17], the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for determining UL TX spatial filter or the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' in QCL-Info of the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState. The reference RS in the indicated DLorJoint-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated UL-TCIState can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.

For aperiodic SRS at least one state of the DCI field is used to select at least one out of the configured SRS resource set(s).

The following SRS parameters are semi-statically configurable by higher layer parameter SRS-Resource or SRSPosResource.
- srs-Resourceld or SRS-PosResourceld determines SRS resource configuration identity.
- Number of SRS ports, as defined by the higher layer parameter nrofSRS-Ports and described in clause 6.4.1.4 of [4, TS 38.211]. If not configured, nroffRS-Ports is 1 .
