co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search space with the lowest controlResourceSetld among CORESETs, which are configured with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH scheduling that PDSCH, in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs associated with the same value of coresetPoollndex as the PDCCH scheduling that PDSCH within the active BWP of the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the 'QCL-TypeD' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol and they are associated with same value of coresetPoollndex, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers).
- If a UE is configured with enableTwoDefaultTCI-States, and at least one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH or PDSCH transmission occasions of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) associated with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states. When the UE is configured by higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA' or is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber, and the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the first PDSCH transmission occasion is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL, the mapping of the TCI states to PDSCH transmission occasions is determined according to clause 5.1.2.1 by replacing the indicated TCI states with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the first PDSCH transmission occasion. In this case, if the 'QCL-TypeD' in both of the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component carriers)
- If a UE is not configured with sfnSchemePdsch, and the UE is configured with sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnScheme A' and there is no TCI codepoint witih two TCI states in the activation command and the CORESET with the lowest ID in the latest slot is indicated with two TCI states, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) associated with the first TCI state of two TCI states indicated for the CORESET.
- In all cases above, if none of configured TCI states for the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', the UE shall obtain the other QCL assumptions from the indicated TCI state(s) for its scheduled PDSCH irrespective of the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH.

If the PDCCH carrying the scheduling DCI is received on one component carrier, and a PDSCH scheduled by that DCI is on another component carrier:
- The timeDurationForQCL is determined based on the subcarrier spacing of the scheduled PDSCH. If \( \mu_{\mathrm{PDCCH}}< \mu_{\text {PDSCH }} \) an additional timing delay \( d \frac{2 \mu_{\text {PDSCH }}}{2^{\mu_{\text {PDCH }}}} \) is added to the timeDurationForQCL, where \( d \) is defined in 5.2.1.5.1a-1, otherwise \( d \) is zero;
- When the UE is configured with enableDefaultBeamForCCS, if the offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the threshold timeDurationForQCL, or if the DL DCI does not have the TCI field present, the UE obtains its QCL assumption for the scheduled PDSCH from the activated TCI state with the lowest ID applicable to PDSCH in the active BWP of the scheduled cell.

A UE that has indicated a capability beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping set to '1', as described in [18, TS 38.822], can determine a spatial domain filter to be used while performing the applicable channel access procedures described in [16, TS 37.213] to transmit a UL transmission on the channel as follows:
- if UE is indicated with an SRI corresponding to the UL transmission, the UE may use a spatial domain filter that is same as the spatial domain transmission filter associated with the indicated SRI,
- if UE is configured with TCI-State configurations with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState, the UE may use a spatial domain transmit filter that is same as the spatial domain receive filter the UE may use to receive the DL reference signal associated with the indicated TCI state.

When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the
