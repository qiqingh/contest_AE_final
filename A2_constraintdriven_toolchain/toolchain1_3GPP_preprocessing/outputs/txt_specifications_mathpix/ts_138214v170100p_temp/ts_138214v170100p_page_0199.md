7 UE procedures for transmitting and receiving on a carrier with intra-cell guard bands

For operation with shared spectrum channel access for FR1, when the UE is configured with any of IntraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for UL carrier and for DL carrier with SCS configuration \( \mu \), the UE is provided with \( N_{\text {RB-set, } \mathrm{X}}-1 \) intra-cell guard bands on a carrier with \( \mu \), each defined by start CRB and size in number of CRBs, \( G B_{s, x}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) and \( G B_{s, x}^{\text {size }, \mu} \), provided by higher layer parameters start \( C R B \) and nrof \( C R B s \), respectively, where \( s \in \left\{0,1, \ldots, N_{\text {RB-set, } \mathrm{X}}-2\right\} \). The subscript \( x \) is set to DL and UL for the downlink and uplink, respectively. Where there is no risk of confusion, the subscript \( x \) can be dropped. The intra-cell guard bands separate \( N_{\text {RB-set, XB }} \) Rets, each defined by start and end CRB, \( R B_{s, x}^{\text {start } \mu} \) and \( R B_{s, x}^{\text {end }, \mu} \), respectively. The UE does not expect that nrofCRBs is configured with nonzero value smaller than the applicable intra-cell guard bands as specified in [8, TS 38.101-1] corresponding to \( \mu \) and carrier size \( N_{\text {grid, } \mathrm{x}}^{\text {size }} \). The UE determines the start and end CRB indices for \( s \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, N_{\text {RB-set }, x}-1\right\} \) as
\[
R B_{s, x}^{\text {start, } \mu}=N_{\text {grid, } x}^{\text {start, } \mu}+\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & s=0 \\
G B_{s-1, x}^{\text {start } \mu}+G B_{s-1, x}^{\text {size, } \mu} & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\]
and
\[
R B_{s, x}^{\mathrm{end}, \mu}=N_{\mathrm{grid}, x}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}+\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
N_{\mathrm{grid}, x}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu}-1 & s=N_{\mathrm{RB}-\mathrm{set} x}-1 \\
G B_{s, x}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}-1 & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\]

The RB set with index \( s \) consists of \( R B_{s_{1} x}^{\text {size } \mu} \) resource blocks where \( R B_{s_{1} x}^{\text {size }, \mu}=R B_{s_{1} x}^{\text {end }, \mu}-R B_{s_{1} x}^{\text {start }, \mu}+1 \). When the UE is not configured with IntraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for \( \mu \), the UE determines the CRB indices for the intra-cell guard band(s), if any, and corresponding RB set(s) according to the nominal intra-cell guard band and RB set pattern as specified in [8, TS 38.101-1] corresponding to \( \mu \) and carrier size \( N_{\text {grid }, x}^{\text {size }, \mu} \). For either or both DL and UL, if the nominal intra-cell guard band and RB set pattern as specified in [8, TS 38.101-1] contains no intra-cell guard bands, the number of RB sets for the carrier is \( N_{\text {RB-set }, x}=1 \).

For a carrier with \( \mu \), the UE expects \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}=R B_{s 0, x}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) and \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\text {size }, \mu}=R B_{s 1, x}^{\text {end }, \mu}-R B_{s 0, x}^{\text {start }, \mu}+1 \) where \( 0 \leq s 0 \leq s 1 \leq N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set }, x}-1 \) for a BWP \( i \) configured by initialDownlinkBWP or BWP-Downlink for the DL BWP, or initialUplinkBWP or BWP-Uplink for the UL BWP. Within the BWP \( i \), RB sets are numbered in increasing order from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set }, x}^{\mathrm{BWP}}-1 \) where \( N_{\mathrm{RB}-\text { set }, x}^{\mathrm{BWP}} \) is the number of RB sets contained in the BWP \( i \) and RB set 0 within the BWP \( i \) corresponds to RB set \( s 0 \) in the carrier and RB set \( N_{\mathrm{RB}-\mathrm{set}, x}^{\mathrm{BWP}}-1 \) within the BWP \( i \) corresponds to RB set \( s 1 \) in the carrier.

When a UE is provided with nrofCRBs \( =0 \) for all intra-cell guard band(s) on a carrier with \( \mu \), the UE is indicated that no intra-cell guard-bands are configured for the carrier and expects \( N_{R B-s e t, x}>1 \). For \( \mu=0 \), the UE expects the number of RBs within a RB set is between 100 and 110 . For \( \mu=1 \), the UE expects the number of RBs within a RB set is between 50 and 55 except for at most one RB set which may contain 56 RBs.

8 Physical sidelink shared channel related procedures
A UE can be configured by higher layers with one or more sidelink resource pools. A sidelink resource pool can be for transmission of PSSCH, as described in Clause 8.1, or for reception of PSSCH, as described in Clause 8.3 and can be associated with either sidelink resource allocation mode 1 or sidelink resource allocation mode 2.
