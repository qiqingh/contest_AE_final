ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

If the DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState configurations are absent in a BWP of the CC, the UE can apply the DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState configurations from a reference BWP of a reference CC. The UE is not expected to be configured with TCI-State, SpatialRelationInfo or PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, except SpatialRelationInfoPos in a CC in a band, if the UE is configured with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState in any CC in the same band. The UE can assume that when the UE is configured with TCI-State in any CC in the CC list configured by simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1-r16, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2-r16, simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1-r16, or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2-r16, the UE is not configured with DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState in any CC within the same band in the CC list.

The UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321] or 6.1.3.x of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states and/or pairs of TCI states, with one TCI state for DL channels/signals and one TCI state for UL channels/signals to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' for one or for a set of CCs/DL BWPs, and if applicable, for one or for a set of CCs/UL BWPs. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a set of CCs/DL BWPs and if applicable, for a set of CCs/UL BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs is determined by the indicated CC in the activation command, the same set of TCI state IDs are applied for all DL and/or UL BWPs in the indicated CCs.

When the bwp-id or cell for QCL-TypeA/D source RS in a QCL-Info of the TCI state configured with DLorJointTCIState is not configured, the UE assumes that QCL-TypeA/D source RS is configured in the CC/DL BWP where TCI state applies.

When tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, the UE with activated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIState receives DCI format 1_1/1_2 providing indicated DLorJointTCIState or ULTCIState for a CC or all CCs in the same CC list configured by simultaneous TCI-UpdateListl-r 17, simultaneous TCI-UpdateList2-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList3-r17, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList4-r17. The DCI format 1_1/1_2 can be with or without, if applicable, DL assignment. If the DCI format \( 1 \_1 / 1 \_2 / \) is without DL assignment, the UE can assume the following:
- CS-RNTI is used to scramble the CRC for the DCI
- The values of the following DCI fields are set as follows:
- \( \mathrm{RV}= \) all '1's
- \( \mathrm{MCS}= \) all '1's
- \( \mathrm{NDI}=0 \)
- Set to all '0's for FDRA Type 0, or all '1's for FDRA Type 1, or all '0's for dynamicSwitch (same as in Table 10.2-4 of [6, TS 38.213]).

After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of more than one DLorJoint-TCIState and before application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:
- The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure

After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of more than one DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState and before application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:
- The UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant during the initial access procedure

After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of more than one DLorJoint-TCIState as part of a Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] and before applying an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:
- The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331].

After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of more than one DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState as part of a Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] and before applying an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:
