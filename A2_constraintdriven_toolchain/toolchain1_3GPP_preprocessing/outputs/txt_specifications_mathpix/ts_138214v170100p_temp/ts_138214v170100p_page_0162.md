After the initial transmission of a transport block, later transmission occasions among the \( K \) repetitions associated with any RV value and associated to any of the first or second SRS resource set can be used for transmitting the transport block.

For any RV sequence, the repetitions shall be terminated after transmitting K nominal repetitions, or at the last transmission occasion among the \( K \) nominal repetitions within the period \( P \), or from the starting symbol of an actual repetition that overlaps with a PUSCH with the same HARQ process scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0,0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), whichever is reached first. The UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the transmission of \( K \) nominal repetitions larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity \( P \).
6.1.2.3.3 Transport Block repetition for uplink transmissions of TB processing over multiple slots with a configured grant

The procedures described in this clause apply to PUSCH transmissions of TB processing over multiple slots with a Type 2 configured grant.

The higher layer parameter repK-RV defines the redundancy version pattern to be applied to the repetitions. If the parameter repK-RV is not provided in the configuredGrantConfig, the redundancy version for uplink transmissions with a configured grant shall be set to 0 . If the parameter repK-RV is provided in the configuredGrantConfig, the \( n \)th transmission occasion among \( N \cdot K \) transmissions occasions, \( n=0,1, \ldots, N \cdot K-1 \), is associated with (mod( \( n-\bmod (n \), \( N) /(N, 4)+1)^{\text {th }} \) value in the configured RV sequence. When \( K=1 \), or when \( K>1 \) and the configured grant configuration is configured with startingFromRV0 set to 'off', the initial transmission of the transport block may only start at the first transmission ocasion of the \( N \cdot K \) transmission occasions. Otherwise, the initial transmission of the transport block may start at
- The first transmission occasion of the \( N \cdot K \) transmission occasions if the configured RV sequence is \( \{0,2,3,1\} \).
- Any transmission occasion \( n \) associated with \( R V=0 \), and for which \( n \bmod N=0 \), if the configured \( R V \) sequence is \( \{0,3,0,3\} \) or \( \{0,0,0,0\} \).

The UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for \( N \cdot K \) transmissions larger than the time duration derived by the periodicity \( P \). If the UE determines that, for a transmission occasion, the number of symbols available in a slot for the PUSCH transmission of TB processing over multiple slots is smaller than transmission duration \( L \), the UE does not transmit the PUSCH in the transmission occasion.

For Type 2 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant of TB processing over multiple slots, the UE shall transmit the TB across the \( N \cdot K \) slots determined for the PUSCH transmission applying the same symbol allocation in each slot. A Type 2 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant of TB processing over multiple slots is omitted in a slot according to the conditions in clause 9, clause 11.1 and clause 11.2A of [6, TS 38.213].
6.1.3 UE procedure for applying transform precoding on PUSCH

For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, or for a PUSCH scheduled by fallbackRAR UL grant, or for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_0 \) with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the UE shall consider the transform precoding either 'enabled' or 'disabled' according to the higher layer configured parameter msg3-transformPrecoder.

For a MsgA PUSCH, the UE shall consider the transform precoding either 'enabled' or 'disabled' according to the higher layer configured parameter msgA-TransformPrecoder. If higher layer parameter msgA-TransformPrecoder is not configured, the UE shall consider the transform precoding either 'enabled' or 'disabled' according to the higher layer configured parameter msg3-transformPrecoder.

For PUSCH transmission scheduled by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI \( =1, \mathrm{C} \)-RNTI, or MCS-CRNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI:
- If the DCI with the scheduling grant was received with DCI format \( 0 \_0 \), the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or disabled according to the higher layer configured parameter msg3-transformPrecoder.
- If the DCI with the scheduling grant was not received with DCI format \( 0 \_0 \)
- If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter transformPrecoder in pusch-Config, the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or disabled according to this parameter.
