where \( n_{s_{f},}^{\mu} \) is the current slot number within a system radio frame, \( n_{f} \) is the number of the system radio frame containing the current slot, \( \mathrm{N}_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame } \mu} \) is the number of slots per frame for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) of the UL BWP that the PUSCH is transmitted on, \( N_{F H} \) is the value of the higher layer parameter PUSCH-FrequencyhoppingInterval, \( \mathrm{RB}_{\text {start }} \) is the starting RB within the UL BWP, as calculated from the resource block assignment information of resource allocation type 1 (described in Clause 6.1.2.2.2) and \( \mathrm{RB}_{\text {offset }} \) is the frequency offset in RBs between the two frequency hops.
6.3.2 Frequency hopping for PUSCH repetition Type B

For PUSCH repetition Type B (as determined according to procedures defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), by frequencyHoppingDCI-0-1 provided in pusch-Config for PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), and by frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB provided in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant for Type 1 configured PUSCH transmission. The frequency hopping mode for Type 2 configured PUSCH transmission follows the configuration of the activating DCI format. One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured:
- Inter-repetition frequency hopping
- Inter-slot frequency hopping

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that two hops of a PUSCH transmission are in different RB sets.

In case of resource allocation type 1, whether or not transform precoding is enabled for PUSCH transmission, the UE may perform PUSCH frequency hopping, if the frequency hopping field in a corresponding detected DCI format is set to 1 , or if for a Type 1 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB is provided, otherwise no PUSCH frequency hopping is performed. When frequency hopping is enabled for PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of [4, TS 38.211].

For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetLists in pusch-Config. For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) and for resource allocation type 1 , frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2 in pusch-Config-
- When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.
- When the size of the active BWP is equal to or greater than 50 PRBs , one of four higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.

For PUSCH based on a Typel configured UL grant the frequency offset is provided by the higher layer parameter frequencyHoppingOffset in rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant.

In case of inter-repetition frequency hopping, the starting RB for an actual repetition within the \( n \)-th nominal repetition (as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1) is given by:
\[
\mathrm{RB}_{\text {statt }}(n)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
\mathrm{RB}_{\text {stat }} & n \bmod 2=0 \\
\left(\mathrm{RB}_{\text {start }}+\mathrm{RB}_{\text {offset }}\right) \bmod N_{B \pi P}^{\text {sce }} & n \bmod 2=1
\end{array},\right.
\]
where \( \mathrm{RB}_{\text {start }} \) is the starting RB within the UL BWP, as calculated from the resource block assignment information of resource allocation type 1 (described in Clause 6.1.2.2.2) and \( \mathrm{RB}_{\mathrm{o}} \) /sset is the frequency offset in RBs between the two frequency hops.
