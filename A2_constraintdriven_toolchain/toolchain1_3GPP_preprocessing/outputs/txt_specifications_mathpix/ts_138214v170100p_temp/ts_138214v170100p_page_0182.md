ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

For operations in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be activated or triggered to transmit SRS on overlapping symbols with more than one SRS resources configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource with resourceType of the SRS resources as 'semi-persistent' or 'aperiodic'.

For intra-band and inter-band CA operations, a UE can simultaneously transmit more than one SRS resource configured by SRS-PosResource on different CCs, subject to UE's capability

For intra-band and inter-band CA operations, a UE can simultaneously transmit more than one SRS resource configured by SRS-PosResource and SRS-Resource on different CCs, subject to UE's capability.
The SRS request field [5, TS38.212] in DCI format \( 0 \_1,1 \_1,0 \_2 \) (if SRS request field is present), \( 1 \_2 \) (if SRS request field is present) indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of [5, TS 38.212]. The 2-bit SRS request field in DCI format 2_3 indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in clause 7.3 of [5, TS 38.212] and defined by the entries of the higher layer parameter srs-ResourceSetToAddModList if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeB', or indicates the SRS transmission on a set of serving cells configured by higher layers if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group set to 'typeA'.

For PUCCH and SRS on the same carrier, a UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying only CSI report(s), or only L1-RSRP report(s), or only L1SINR report(s). A UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured or aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK, link recovery request (as defined in clause 9.24 of [6,38.213]) and/or SR. In the case that SRS is not transmitted due to overlap with PUCCH, only the SRS symbol(s) that overlap with PUCCH symbol(s) are dropped. PUCCH shall not be transmitted when aperiodic SRS is triggered to be transmitted to overlap in the same symbol with PUCCH carrying semi-persistent/periodic CSI report(s) or semi-persistent/periodic L1-RSRP report(s) only, or only L1-SINR report(s).

In case of intra-band carrier aggregation or in inter-band CA band combination if simultaneous SRS and PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions are not supported by UE, the UE is not expected to be configured with SRS from a carrier and PUSCH/UL DM-RS/UL PT-RS/PUCCH formats from a different carrier in the same symbol.

In case of intra-band carrier aggregation or in inter-band CA band combination if simultaneous SRS and PRACH transmissions are not supported by UE, the UE shall not transmit simultaneously SRS resource(s) from a carrier and PRACH from a different carrier.

In case a SRS resource with resourceType set as 'aperiodic' is triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic/semi-persistent SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the aperiodic SRS resource and only the periodic/semi-persistent SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic/semipersistent SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with the aperiodic SRS resource are transmitted. In case a SRS resource with resourceType set as 'semi-persistent' is triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the semi-persistent SRS resource and only the periodic SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with the semi-persistent SRS resource are transmitted.

When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'antennaSwitching', and a guard period of Y symbols is configured according to Clause 6.2.1.2, the UE shall use the same priority rules as defined above during the guard period as if SRS was configured.

When a spatialRelationInfo is activated/updated for a semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-Resource by a MAC CE for a set of CCs/BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs provided by higher layer parameter simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 1 or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList 2 is determined by the indicated CC in the MAC CE, the spatialRelationInfo is applied for the semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource(s) with the same SRS resource ID for all the BWPs in the determined CCs.

When the higher layer parameter enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS is set 'enabled', and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo for the SRS resource, except for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'beamManagement' or for the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter usage in SRSResourceSet set to 'nonCodebook' with configuration of associatedCSI-RS or for the SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet, is not configured in FR2 and if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter(s) pathlossReferenceRS, and if the UE is not configured with different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSets, and is not provided at least one TCI codepoint mapped with two TCI states, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource in an active UL BWP of a CC,
- according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' corresponding to the QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest controlResourceSetld in the active DL
