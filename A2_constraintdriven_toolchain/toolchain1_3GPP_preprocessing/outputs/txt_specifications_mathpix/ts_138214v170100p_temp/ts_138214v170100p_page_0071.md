'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index', 'cri-SINRCapability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-SINR-Capability[Set]Index'.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'none', then the UE shall not report any quantity for the CSI-ReportConfig-

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-PMICQI', or 'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI', the UE shall report a preferred precoder matrix for the entire reporting band, or a preferred precoder matrix per subband, according to Clause 5.2.2.2.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-i1',
- the UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and pmi-FormatIndicator set to 'widebandPMI' and,
- the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication ( \( i_{1} \) in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-i1-CQI',
- the UE expects, for that CSI-ReportConfig, to be configured with higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typel-SinglePanel' and pmi-FormatIndicator set to 'widebandPMI' and,
- the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication ( \( i_{1} \) in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band. The CQ[ is calculated conditioned on the reported \( i_{1} \) assuming PDSCH transmission with \( N_{p} \geq 1 \) precoders (corresponding to the same \( i_{1} \) but different \( i_{2} \) in Clause 5.2.2.2.1), where the UE assumes that one precoder is randomly selected from the set of \( N_{p} \) precoders for each PRG on PDSCH, where the PRG size for CQI calculation is configured by the higher layer parameter pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI.

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RI-CQI',
- if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contained in a CSI-ReportConfig, \( r \) ports are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank \( r \) and each CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the CSI-ReportConfig based on the order of the associated NZP-CSI-RS-Resourceld in the linked CSI resource setting for channel measurement given by higher layer parameter resourcesForChannelMeasurement. The configured higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication contains a sequence \( p_{0}^{(1)}, p_{0}^{(2)}, p_{1}^{(2)}, p_{0}^{(3)}, p_{1}^{(3)}, p_{2}^{(3)}, \ldots, p_{0}^{(R)}, p_{1}^{(R)}, \ldots, p_{R-1}^{(R)} \) of port indices, where \( p_{0}^{(v)}, \ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)} \) are the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank \( v \) and \( R \in\{1,2, \ldots, P\} \) where \( P \in\{1,2,4,8\} \) is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI corresponding to the configured fields of PortIndexFor 8Ranks.
- if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter non-PMI-PortIndication, the UE assumes, for each CSIRS resource in the CSI resource setting linked to the CSI-ReportConfig, that the CSI-RS port indices \( p_{0}^{(v)}, \ldots, p_{v-1}^{(v)}=\{0, \ldots, v-1\} \) are associated with ranks \( v=1,2, \ldots, P \) where \( P \in\{1,2,4,8\} \) is the number of ports in the CSI-RS resource.
- When calculating the CQI for a rank, the UE shall use the ports indicated for that rank for the selected CSI-RS resource. The precoder for the indicated ports shall be assumed to be the identity matrix scaled by \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{v}} \).

If the UE is configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to 'cri-RSRP', 'ssb-Index-RSRP', 'cri-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index' or 'ssb-Index-RSRP-Capability[Set]Index',
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'disabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single report nrofReportedRS (higher layer configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting.
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter groupBasedBeamReporting set to 'enabled', the UE is not required to update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive filters.
