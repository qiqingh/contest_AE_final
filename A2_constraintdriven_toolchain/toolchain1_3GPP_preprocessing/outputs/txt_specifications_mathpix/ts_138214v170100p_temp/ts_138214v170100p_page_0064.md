The UE may be configured to measure and report, via high layer parameter
[MeasPRSwithDiffRxTXTEGs_Request_UXRxTx] subject to UE capability, UE Rx -Tx time difference measurements with the same UE Tx TEG using up to 8 different UE RxTx TEGs. The high layer parameter [MeasPRSwithDiffRxTXTEGs_Request_UXRxTx] applies to all DL PRS positioning frequency layers.

The UE in RRC_INACTIVE mode is expected to prioritize the reception of any other DL signals and DL channels than the reception of DL PRS.

The UE in RRC_INACTIVE mode, subject to UE capability, is expected to process DL PRS outside and inside of the initial DL BWP. The UE may be configured with the same or different numerology and CP for PRS resources than those of the initial DL BWP for DL PRS processing outside of the initial DL BWP. The UE may be configured with the same numerology and CP for PRS resources as those of the initial DL BWP for DL PRS processing inside of the initial DL BWP.

For a UE configured with preconfigured Measurement gap(s) for Positioning, when the UE receives an activation command, as described in clause [6.1.3X] of [10, TS 38.321], for a preconfigured Measurement Gap for Positioning activation/deactivation, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

For a UE configured with PRS Processing Window(s), when the UE receives an activation/deactivation command, as described in clause [6.1.3.X] of [10, TS 38.321], for a PRS processing window activation, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and the UE assumptions shall be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subrame, } \mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The UE is not expected to be indicated with more than 4 activated [PRSProcessing Window] across all active DL BWPs and is not expected to be indicated with the activated [PRSProcessing Window] that overlap in time.
5.1.7 Code block group based PDSCH transmission
5.1.7.1 UE procedure for grouping of code blocks to code block groups

If a UE is configured to receive code block group (CBG) based transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter codeBlockGroupTransmission for PDSCH, the UE shall determine the number of CBGs for a transport block reception as
\[
M=\min (N, C)
\]
where \( N \) is the maximum number of CBGs per transport block as configured by maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock for PDSCH, and \( C \) is the number of code blocks in the transport block according to the procedure defined in Clause 7.2.3 of [5, TS 38.212].

Define \( M_{1}=\bmod (C, M), K_{1}=\left\lceil\frac{C}{M}\right\rceil \), and \( K_{2}=\left\lfloor\frac{C}{M}\right\rfloor \).
If \( M_{1}>0 \), CBG \( m, m=0,1, \ldots, M_{1}-1 \), consists of code blocks with indices \( m \cdot K_{1}+k, k=0,1, \ldots, K_{1}-1 \). CBG \( m \), \( m=M_{1}, M_{1}+1, \ldots, M-1 \), consists of code blocks with indices \( M_{1} \cdot K_{1}+\left(m-M_{1}\right) \cdot K_{2}+k, k=0,1, \ldots, K_{2}-1 \).
5.1.7.2 UE procedure for receiving code block group based transmissions

If a UE is configured to receive code block group-based transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter codeBlockGroupTransmission for PDSCH,
- The 'CBG transmission information' (CBGTI) field of DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) is of length \( N_{T B} \cdot N \) bits, where \( N_{T B} \) is the value of the higher layer parameter maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI. If \( N_{T B}=2 \) the CBGTI field bits are mapped such that the first set of \( N \) bits starting from the MSB corresponds to the first TB while the second set of \( N \) bits corresponds to a second TB, if scheduled. The first \( M \) bits of each set of \( N \) bits in the CBGTI field have an in-order one-to-one mapping with the \( M \) CBGs of the TB, with the MSB mapped to CBG\#0.
