A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to other than 'none' for aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a CSI-ReportConfig for periodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with trs-Info.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured both with trs-Info and repetition.
Each CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], is configured by the higher layer parameter \( N Z P \) -CSI-RS-Resource with the following restrictions:
- the time-domain locations of the two CSI-RS resources in a slot, or of the four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots (which are the same across two consecutive slots), as defined by higher layer parameter CSI-RS-resourceMapping, is given by one of
- \( l \in\{4,8\}, l \in\{5,9\} \), or \( l \in\{6,10\} \) for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 ,
- \( l \in\{0,4\}, l \in\{1,5\}, l \in\{2,6\}, l \in\{3,7\}, l \in\{7,11\}, l \in\{8,12\} \) or \( l \in\{9,13\} \) for frequency range 2 .
- a single port CSI-RS resource with density \( \rho=3 \) given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 from [4, TS 38.211] and higher layer parameter density configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping.
- if carrier \( N_{\mathrm{grid}}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu}=52, N_{\mathrm{BWP}, \mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{size}}=52, \mu=0 \) and the carrier is configured in paired spectrum, the band width of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freq Band configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is \( X \) resource blocks, where \( X \geq 28 \) resources if the UE indicates trs-AddB W-Set I for the trs-AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 1] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation and \( X \geq 32 \) if the UE indicates \( t r s \)-AddBW-Set2 for the AdditionalBandwidth capability for CSI-RS for tracking or [FG35-2, set 2] for the [FG35-2] capability for aperiodic CSI-RS for fast SCell activation; in these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising \( \mathrm{X}<52 \) resource blocks, the UE does not expect that the total number of PRBs allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4 , where all CSI-RS resource configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer parameter freqBand configured by CSI-RS-ResourceMapping, is the minimum of 52 and \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{BWP}, \mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{size}} \) resource blocks, or is equal to \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{BWP}, \mathrm{i}}^{\text {size }} \) resource blocks. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, freqBand configured by CSI-RSResourceMapping, is the minimum of 48 and \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{BWP}, \mathrm{i}}^{\text {size }} \) resource blocks, or is equal to \( \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{BWP}, \mathrm{i}} \) sizesource blocks.
- the UE is not expected to be configured with the periodicity of \( 2^{\mu} \times 10 \) slots if the band width of CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks.
- the periodicity and slot offset for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, as given by the higher layer parameter periodicityAndOffset configured by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, is one of \( 2^{\mu} X_{p} \) slots where \( X_{F}=10,20,40 \), or 80 and where \( \mu \) is defined in Clause 4.3 of [4, TS 38.211].
- same powerControlOffset and powerControlOffsetSS given by NZP-CSI-RS-Resource value across all resources.

A UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can receive a higher layer configuration of TRS occasions via TRSResourceSetConfig.
- For frequency range 1 , the UE may be configured with one or more TRS resource set(s), where each TRS resource set configured by a TRS-ResourceSet consists of four periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in each slot. If no two consecutive slots are indicated as downlink slots by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, then the UE may be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS set(s), where a TRS-ResourceSet consists of two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in one slot.
- For frequency range 2 the UE may be configured with one or more TRS resource set(s), where each TRS resource set configured by a TRS-ResourceSet consists of two periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in one slot or by a TRS-ResourceSet of four periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic NZP CSIRS resources in each slot.

Each NZP CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of [4, TS 38.211], is configured by the higher layer parameter TRS-ResourceSet with the following restrictions for a UE in RRC_[DLE or RRC_INACTIVE:
