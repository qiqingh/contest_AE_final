For pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-rl7 in pusch-Config, each PUSCH has a separate SLIV, mapping type and \( K_{2} \). The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 signalled in DCI format 0_1.

If a UE is configured with pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PUSCH on a UL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is indicated re-transmission of PUSCH by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), where the PUSCH is correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH-r17 by the DCI is more than one.

When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by the 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1 _ 1 if the same field is available. When the UE is configured with minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 in an active UL BWP and it has not received 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' field in DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 1 \_1 \), the UE shall apply a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on 'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator' value ' 0 '. When the minimum scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be scheduled with a DCI in slot \( n \) to transmit a PUSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI with \( K_{2} \) smaller than \( \left\lceil K_{2 \text { min }} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu}}{2^{\mu}}\right\rceil \), where \( K_{2 \text { mn }} \) and \( \mu \) are the applied minimum scheduling offset restriction and the numerology of the active UL BWP of the scheduled cell when receiving the DCI in slot \( n \), respectively, and \( \mu^{\prime} \) is the numerology of the new active UL BWP in case of active UL BWP change in the scheduled cell and is equal to \( \mu \), otherwise. The minimum scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PUSCH transmission is scheduled by RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant for RACH procedure, or when PUSCH is scheduled with TC-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1.

When two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-02 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', for PUSCH repetition Type A, in case \( K>1 \), the same symbol allocation is applied across the \( K \) consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The UE shall repeat the TB across the \( K \) consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, and the association of the first and second SRS resource set in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 to each slot is determined as follows:
- if a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 00 " for the SRS resource set indicator, the first SRS resource set is associated with all K consecutive slots,
- if a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 01 " for the SRS resource set indicator, the second SRS resource set is associated with all K consecutive slots,
- if a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 10 " for the SRS resource set indicator, the first and second SRS resource set association to K consecutive slots is determined as follows:
- When \( K=2 \), the first and second SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of 2 consecutive slots, respectively.
- When K > 2 and cyclicMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the first and second SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, respectively, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of K consecutive slots.
- When K > 2 and sequentialMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, first SRS resource set is applied to the first and second slots of K consecutive slots, and the second SRS resource set is applied to the third and fourth slot of K consecutive slots, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of K consecutive slots.
- Otherwise, a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint "11" for the SRS resource set indicator, and the first and second SRS resource set association to K consecutive slots is determined as follows,
- When \( K=2 \), the second and first SRS resource set are applied to the first and second slot of 2 consecutive slots, respectively.
- When K > 2 and cyclicMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the second and first SRS resource sets are applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, respectively, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of the K consecutive slots.
