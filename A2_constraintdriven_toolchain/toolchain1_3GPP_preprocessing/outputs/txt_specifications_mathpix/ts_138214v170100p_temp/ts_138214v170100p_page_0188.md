6.2.1.3 UE sounding procedure between component carriers

A UE can be configured with SRS resource(s) on a carrier \( c_{l} \) with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols and not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission. For carrier \( c_{t} \), the UE is configured with higher layer parameter srsSwitchFromServCellIndex and srs-SwitchFromCarrier the switching from carrier \( c_{2} \) which is configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission. During SRS transmission on carrier \( c_{1} \) (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR), the UE temporarily suspends the uplink transmission on carrier \( c_{2} \) -

For an SRS transmission starting in symbol \( N_{c_{1}} \) of carrier \( c_{1} \) and a conflicting transmission in carrier \( c_{2} \) starting in symbol \( N_{c_{2}} \), the UE shall apply the prioritization/dropping rules in the remainder of this clause taking into account:
- \( \quad \mathrm{DCl}(\mathrm{s}) \) for which the time interval between the last symbol of PDCCH and \( N_{c_{1}} \) is at least \( N_{2} \) symbols and an additional time duration \( \mathrm{T}_{S R S_{C S}} \), and the time interval between the last symbol of PDCCH and \( N_{c_{2}} \) is at least \( N_{2} \) symbols; and
- semi-persistent CSI reports or SRS considered active at least \( N_{2} \) symbols and an additional time duration \( \mathrm{T}_{S R S C S} \) before \( N_{c_{1}} \), and considered active at least \( N_{2} \) symbols before \( N_{c_{2}} \).
where \( T_{S R S_{C S}}=\max \{ \) switchingTimeUL, switchingTimeDL\}, and the time interval unit of OFDM symbol is counted based on the smaller subcarrier spacing across \( c_{1}, c_{2} \) and their corresponding scheduling cells.

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall not transmit SRS whenever SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) on the carrier of the serving cell and PUSCH/PUCCH transmission carrying HARQ-ACK/positive SR/RI/CRI/SSBRI and/or PRACH happen to overlap in the same symbol_and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE's indicated uplink carrier aggregation capability included in [13, TS 38.306].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall not transmit a periodic/semi-persistent SRS whenever periodic/semi-persistent SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) on the carrier of the serving cell and PUSCH transmission carrying aperiodic CSI happen to overlap in the same symbol and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE's indicated uplink carrier aggregation capability included in [13, TS 38.306].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall drop PUCCH/PUSCH transmission carrying periodic/semi-persistent CSI comprising only CQI/PMI/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR, and/or SRS transmission on another serving cell configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission whenever the transmission and SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133] as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTime UL and switchingTimeDL of SRSSwitchingTimeNR) on the serving cell happen to overlap in the same symbol and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE's indicated uplink carrier aggregation capability included in [13, TS 38.306].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall drop PUSCH transmission carrying aperiodic CSI comprising only CQI/PMI/L1-RSRP/L1SINR whenever the transmission and aperiodic SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [11, TS 38.133]) as defined by higher layer parameters switchingTimeUL and switchingTimeDL of SRS-SwitchingTimeNR) on the carrier of the serving cell happen to overlap in the same symbol and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE's indicated uplink carrier aggregation capability included in [13, TS 38.306].
