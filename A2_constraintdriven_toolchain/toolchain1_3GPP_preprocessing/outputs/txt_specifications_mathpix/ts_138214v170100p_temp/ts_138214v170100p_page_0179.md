- when a UE receives a deactivation command [10, TS 38.321] for an activated SRS resource set, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, the corresponding actions in [10, TS 38.321] and UE assumption on cessation of SRS transmission corresponding to the deactivated SRS resource set shall apply starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe, } \mu} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.
- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos containing the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index', 'ssb-IndexServing', or 'ssb-IndexNcell' the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'csi-RS-Index' or 'csi-RS-IndexServing', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfo or spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'srs' or 'srs-SpatialRelation', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the reference semi-persistent SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResourceSet and if the higher layer parameter spatialRelationInfoPos contains the ID of a reference 'dl-PRS', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS.

If the UE has an active semi-persistent SRS resource configuration and has not received a deactivation command, the semi-persistent SRS configuration is considered to be active in the UL BWP which is active, otherwise it is considered suspended.

For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and when the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource is set to 'aperiodic':
- the UE receives a configuration of SRS resource sets,
- the UE receives a downlink DCI, a group common DCI, or an uplink DCI based command where a codepoint of the DCI may trigger one or more SRS resource set(s). For SRS in a resource set with usage set to 'codebook' or 'antennaSwitching', the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is \( N_{2} \) symbols and an additional time duration \( T_{\text {switch- }} \) Otherwise, the minimal time interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is \( N_{2}+14 \) symbols and an additional time duration \( T_{\text {switch }} \). The minimal time interval unit of OFDM symbol is counted based on the minimum subcarrier spacing given by \( \min \left(\mu_{P D C C H}, \mu_{U L L}\right) \) where \( \mu_{U L} \) is given by \( \min \left(\mu_{U L, c a r n e r}, \mu_{U L, c a r r e r}, \mu_{S R S}\right) \) when the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to 'dualUL' for uplink carrier aggregation, and by \( \mu_{S R S} \) otherwise. \( \mu_{S R S} \) and \( \mu_{P D C C H} \) are the subcarrier spacing configurations for triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command respectively.
- \( T_{\text {switch }}, \mu_{\text {Ul.carrier }} \) and \( \mu_{\text {Ul.carrier } 2} \) are defined in clause 6.4.
- When UE reporting [Triggering SRS only in DCI 0_1/0_2], the UE can be indicated with DCI 0_1 and \( 0 \_2 \) to trigger aperiodic SRS without data and without CSI as described in clause 7.3.1.1 of TS38.212. Otherwise, except for DCI format \( 0 \_1 / 0 \_2 \) with CRC scrambled by SP-CSI-RNTI, a UE is not expected to receive a DCI format \( 0 \_1 / 0 \_2 \) with UL-SCH indicator of " 0 " and CSI request of all zero(s) as described in clause 7.3.1.1 of [5, TS 38.212].
- If the UE receives the DCI triggering aperiodic SRS in slot \( n \) and at least one resource set is configured with parameter availableSlotOffset across all configured BWPs in a component carrier except when SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter SRS-PosResource,
- If ca-SlotOffset is configured, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in the ( \( t+1 \) )-th available slot counting from slot
- otherwise the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in the ( \( t+1 \) )-th available slot counting from slot \( \left|n \cdot \frac{2^{\mu}{ }^{\mu}{ }^{\mu}{ }^{\mu}{ }^{\mu}{ }}{2}\right|+k \), where
