- The slot where the nominal repetition ends is given by \( K_{s}+\left\lfloor\frac{S+(n+1) \cdot L-1}{N_{s y m b}^{s l o}}\right\rfloor \), and the ending symbol relative to the start of the slot is given by \( \bmod \left(S+(n+1) \cdot L-1, N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {stot }}\right) \).

Here \( K_{s} \) is the slot where the PUSCH transmission starts, and \( N_{s y+b}^{s o r} \) is the number of symbols per slot as defined in Clause 4.3 .2 of [4, TS38.211].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, the UE determines invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission as follows:
- A symbol that is indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DLConfigurationDedicated is considered as an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.
- For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbols indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.
- For a reduced capability half-duplex UE in paired spectrum and for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission, symbols indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.
- For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbol(s) indicated by pdcch-ConfigSIBl in MIB for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.
- For operation in unpaired spectrum, if numberOffnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching is configured, numberOffnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching symbol(s) after the last symbol that is indicated as downlink in each consecutive set of all symbols that are indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. The symbol(s) given by numberOflnvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching are defined using the reference SCS configuration referenceSubcarrierSpacing provided in tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon.
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access with semi-static channel occupancy, symbols in an idle duration associated with a periodic channel occupancy as described in Clause 4.3.1.1 of [16,37.213], or in an idle duration in a period associated with an initiated channel occupancy as described in Clause 4.3.2. of [16, TS 37.213] are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.
- The UE may be configured with the higher layer parameter invalidSymbolPattern, which provides a symbol level bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameter symbols given by invalidSymbolPattern). A bit value equal to 1 in the symbol level bitmap symbols indicates that the corresponding symbol is an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. The UE may be additionally configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter periodicityAndPattern given by invalidSymbolPattern), where each bit of periodicityAndPattern corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the symbol level bitmap symbols, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the symbol level bitmap symbols is present in the unit. The periodicityAndPattern can be \( \{1,2,4,5,8,10,20 \) or 40\( \} \) units long, but maximum of 40 msec . The first symbol of periodicityAndPattern every \( 40 \mathrm{msec} / \mathrm{P} \) periods is a first symbol in frame \( n_{f} \bmod 4=0 \), where P is the duration of periodicityAndPattern-r 16 in units of msec. When periodicityAndPattern is not configured, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a radio frame. If invalidSymbolPattern is configured, when the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern is determined as follows:
- if the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), or corresponds to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \), and if invalidSymbolPatternIndicatorDCI-0-1 is configured,
- if invalid symbol pattern indicator field is set 1 , the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern;
- otherwise, the UE does not apply the invalid symbol pattern;
- if the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), or corresponds to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format \( 0 \_2 \), and if invalidSymbolPatternIndicatorDCI-0-2 is configured,
- if invalid symbol pattern indicator field is set 1 , the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern;
