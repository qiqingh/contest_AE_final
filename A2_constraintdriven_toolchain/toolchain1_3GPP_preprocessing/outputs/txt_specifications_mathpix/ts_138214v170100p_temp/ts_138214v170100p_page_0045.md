- The UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant during random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331].

If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of a single DLorJoint-TCIState, that can be used as an indicated TCI state, the UE obtains the QCL assumptions from the configured TCI state for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI -RS applying the indicated TCI state.

If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of a single DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, that can be used as an indicated TCI state, the UE determines an UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, from the configured TCI state for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and SRS applying the indicated TCI state.

When the UE would transmit the last symbol of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to the DCI carrying the TCI State indication and without DL assignment, or corresponding to the PDSCH scheduling by the DCI carrying the TCI State indication, and if the indicated TCI State is different from the previously indicated one, the indicated DLorJointTCIState or UL-TCIstate should be applied starting from the first slot that is at least BeamAppTime_r17 symbols after the last symbol of the PUCCH. The first slot and the BeamAppTime_r17 symbols are both determined on the carrier with the smallest SCS among the carrier(s) applying the beam indication.

If a UE is configured with pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 in which one or more rows contain multiple SLIVs for PDSCH on a DL BWP of a serving cell, and the UE is receiving a DCI carrying the TCI-State indication and without DL assignment, the UE does not expect that the number of indicated SLIVs in the row of the pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH-r 17 by the DCI is more than one.

If the UE is configured with [NumberOfAdditionalPCI] and with PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoollndex in ControlResourceSet, the UE receives an activation command for CORESET associated with each coresetPoollndex, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' in one CC/DL BWP. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a coresetPoollndex, the activated TCI states corresponding to one coresetPoollndex can be associated with one physical cell ID and activated TCI states corresponding to another coresetPoollndex can be associated with another physical cell ID.

When a UE supports two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' the UE may receive an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.24 of [10, TS 38.321], the activation command is used to map up to 8 combinations of one or two TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'. The UE is not expected to receive more than 8 TCI states in the activation command.

When the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' is present in DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) and when the number of codepoints S in the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' of DCI format \( 1 \_2 \) is smaller than the number of TCI codepoints that are activated by the activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 and 6.1.3.24 of [10, TS38.321], only the first \( S \) activated codepoints are applied for DCI format \( 1 \_2 \).

When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot \( n \) corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field Transmission Configuration Indication'should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot \( n+3 N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subrame, } \mu}+ \frac{2^{\mu}}{2^{\mu_{K} a c}} \cdot k_{\text {mac }} \) where \( \mu \) is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH and \( \mu_{K_{\text {mac }}} \) is the subcarrier spacing configuration for \( k_{\text {mac }} \) with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 , and \( k_{\text {mac }} \) is provided by \( K \)-Mac or \( k_{\text {mac }}=0 \) if \( K \)-Mac is not provided. If tci-PresentInDCI is set to 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than timeDurationForQCL if applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter tci-PresentInDCI that is set as 'enabled' for the CORESET scheduling a PDSCH, the UE assumes that the TCI field is present in the DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) of the PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET. If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter tci-PresentDCI-1-2 for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, the UE assumes that the TCI field with a DCI field size indicated by tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is present in the DCI format 1_2 of the PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET. If the PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format not having the TCI field present, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is equal to or greater than a threshold timeDurationForQCL if applicable, where the threshold is based on reported UE capability [13, TS 38.306], for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location, the UE assumes that
