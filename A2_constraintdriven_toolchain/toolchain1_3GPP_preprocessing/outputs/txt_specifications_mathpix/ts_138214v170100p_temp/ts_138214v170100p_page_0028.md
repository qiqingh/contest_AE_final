If a UE is scheduled a PDSCH with DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) or \( 4 \_0 \), the UE shall assume that \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) is equal to 2 PRBs.
When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) for bandwidth part is equal to 2 PRBs unless configured by the higher layer parameter prbBundlingType given by PDSCH-Config.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format \( 1 \_1 \) with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'dynamicBundling', the higher layer parameters bundleSizeSet 1 and bundleSizeSet 2 configure two sets of \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values, the first set can take one or two \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values among \( \{2,4 \), wideband \( \} \), and the second set can take one \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) value among \( \{2,4 \), wideband \( \} \).

If the PRB 'bundling size indicator' signalled in DCI format 1 _1 as defined in Clause 7.3.1.2.2 of [5, TS 38.212]
- is set to ' 0 ', the UE shall use the \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) value from the second set of \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values when receiving PDSCH scheduled by the same DCI.
- is set to ' 1 ' and one value is configured for the first set of \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values, the UE shall use this \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) value when receiving PDSCH scheduled by the same DCI
- is set to ' 1 ' and two values are configured for the first set of \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values as ' n 2 -wideband' (corresponding to two \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values 2 and wideband) or ' \( n 4 \)-wideband' (corresponding to two \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) values 4 and wideband), the UE shall use the value when receiving PDSCH scheduled by the same DCI as follows:
- If the scheduled PRBs are contiguous and the size of the scheduled PRBs is larger than \( N_{B W P, i}^{s i z e}, / 2, P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) is the same as the scheduled bandwidth, otherwise \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) is set to the remaining configured value of 2 or 4, respectively.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1 _1 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer parameter prb-BundlingType is set to 'staticBundling', the \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime} \) value is configured with the single value indicated by the higher layer parameter bundleSize.

When a UE is configured with nominal RBG size \( P=2 \) for bandwidth part \( i \) according to Clause 5.1.2.2.1, or when a UE is configured with interleaving unit of 2 for VRB to PRB mapping provided by the higher layer parameter vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver given by PDSCH-Config for band width part \( i \), the UE is not expected to be configured with \( P_{B W P, i}^{\prime}= \) 4.

For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'fdmScheme A' or 'fdmSchemeB', and when the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)',
- If \( P_{B W P, .}^{\prime} \) is determined as "wideband", the first \( \left[\frac{n_{P R B}}{2}\right] \) PRBs are assigned to the first TCI state and the remaining \( \left\lfloor\frac{n_{P R B}}{2}\right\rfloor \) PRBs are assigned to the second TCI state, where \( n_{P R B} \) is the total number of allocated PRBs for the UE.
- If \( P_{B W P, ~ i}^{\prime} \) is determined as one of the values among \( \{2,4\} \), even PRGs within the allocated frequency domain resources are assigned to the first TCI state and odd PRGs within the allocated frequency domain resources are assigned to the second TCI state, wherein the PRGs are numbered continuously in increasing order with the first PRG index equal to 0 .
- The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion.

For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'fdmSchemeB', and when the UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field 'Antenna Port(s)', each PDSCH transmission occasion shall follow the Clause 7.3.1 of [4, TS 38.211] with the mapping to resource elements determined by the assigned PRBs for corresponding TCI state of the PDSCH transmission occasion, and the UE shall only expect at most two code blocks per PDSCH transmission occasion when a single transmission layer is scheduled and a single code block per PDSCH transmission occasion when two transmission layers are scheduled. For two PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where \( n=0,1 \) are applied to the first and second TCI state, respectively.
