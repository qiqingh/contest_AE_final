ETSI TS 138214 V17.1.0 (2022-05)

For PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, a nominal TDW consists of one or multiple actual TDWs. The UE determines the actual TDWs as follows:
- The start of the first actual TDW is the first symbol of the first PUCCH transmission in a slot determined for PUCCH tranmission within the nominal TDW.
- The end of an actual TDW is
- The last symbol of the last PUCCH transmission in a slot determined for transmission of the PUCCH within the nominal TDW, if the actual TDW reaches the end of the last PUCCH transmission within the nominal TDW.
- The last symbol of a PUCCH transmission before the event, if an event occurs which causes power consistency and phase continuity not be maintained across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition within the nominal TDW, and the PUCCH transmission is in a slot determined for transmission of the PUCCH.
- When PUCCH-Window-Restart is enabled, the start of a new actual TDW is the first symbol of the PUCCH transmission after the event which causes power consistency and phase continuity not to be maintained across PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition within the nominal TDW, and the PUCCH transmission is in a slot determined for transmission of the PUCCH.

Events which cause power consistency and phase continuity not to be maintained across PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \), or PUSCH repetition Type A with a configured grant, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, or PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, within the nominal TDW, are:
- A downlink slot or downlink reception or downlink monitoring based on tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated for unpaired spectrum.
- The gap between any two consecutive PUSCH transmissions, or the gap between any two consecutive PUCCH transmissions, exceeds 13 symbols for normal cyclic prefix or exceeds 11 symbols for extended cyclic prefix.
- The gap between any two consecutive PUSCH transmissions, or the gap between any two consecutive PUCCH transmissions, does not exceed 13 symbols but other uplink transmissions are scheduled between the two consecutive PUSCH transmissions or the two consecutive PUCCH transmissions.
- For PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B or TB processing over multiple slots, a dropping or cancellation of a PUSCH transmission according to clause 9 , clause 11.1 and clause 11.2A of [6, TS 38.213].
- For PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, a dropping or cancellation of a PUCCH transmission according to clause 9, clause 9.2.6 and clause 11.1 of [6, TS 38.213].
- For any two consecutive PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A, or PUSCH repetition type B, and when two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', a different SRS resource set association is used for the two PUSCH transmissions of PUSCH repetition type A , or PUSCH repetition type B , according to Clause 6.1.2.1.
- For any two consecutive PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, and when a PUCCH resource used for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission by a UE includes first and second spatial relations or first and second sets of power control parameters, as described in [10, TS 38.321] and in clause 7.2.1 of [6, TS 38.213], different spatial relations or different power control parameters are used for the two PUCCH transmissions of PUCCH repetition, according to Clause 9.2 .6 of [6, TS 38.213].
- Uplink timing adjustment in response to a timing advance command according to clause 4.2 of [6, TS 38.213].
- Frequency hopping.
- For reduced capability half-duplex UEs,
- a dropping or cancellation of a PUSCH transmission according to clause 17.2 of [6, TS 38.213] or
- an overlapping of the gap between two consecutive PUSCH transmissions and any symbol of downlink reception or downlink monitoring
