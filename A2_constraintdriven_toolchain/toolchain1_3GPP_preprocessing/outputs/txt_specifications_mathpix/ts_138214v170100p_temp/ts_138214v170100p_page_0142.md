- For PUSCH repetition Type B, the starting symbol \( S \) relative to the start of the slot, and the number of consecutive symbols \( L \) counting from the symbol \( S \) allocated for the PUSCH are provided by startSymbol and length of the indexed row of the resource allocation table, respectively.
- For PUSCH repetition Type A and TB processing over multiple slots, the PUSCH mapping type is set to Type A or Type B as defined in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of [4, TS 38.211] as given by the indexed row.
- For PUSCH repetition Type B, the PUSCH mapping type is set to Type B.

The UE shall consider the \( S \) and \( L \) combinations defined in table 6.1.2.1-1 as valid PUSCH allocations

\begin{table}

\caption{Table 6.1.2.1-1: Valid \( S \) and \( L \) combinations}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multirow{2}{*}{PUSCH mapping type} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Normal cyclic prefix} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Extended cyclic prefix} \\
\hline & S & \( \boldsymbol{L} \) & S+L & S & \( L \) & S+L \\
\hline Type A (repetition Type A only) & 0 & \{4,...,14\} & \{4,...,14\} & 0 & \{4,...,12\} & \{4,...,12\} \\
\hline Type B & \{0,...,13\} & \{1,...,14\} & \( \{1, \ldots, 14\} \) for repetition Type A, \( \{1, \ldots, 27\} \) for repetition Type B & \{0,..., 11\} & \{1,...,12\} & \( \{1, \ldots, 12\} \) for repetition Type A, \( \{1, \ldots, 23\} \) for repetition Type B \\

For TB processing over multiple slots, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1,
- the number of slots used for TBS determination \( N \) is indicated by numberOfSlotsTBoMS.
- the number of repetitions \( K \) of the number of slots \( N \) used for TBS determination is determined as
- if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table, the number of repetitions \( K \) is equal to numberOfRepetitions;
- otherwise, \( K=1 \).
- when the UE supports repetition of TB processing over multiple slots, the UE does not expect that \( N \cdot K \) is larger than 32.

When configured with \( \mu=5 \) or 6 the UE does not expect to be scheduled with more than one PUSCH in a slot, by a single DCI or multiple DCIs.

For PUSCH repetition Type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or \( 0 \_2 \) in PDCCH with CRC scrambled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, the number of repetitions \( K \) is determined as
- if numberOfRepetitions is present in the resource allocation table, the number of repetitions K is equal to numberOfRepetitions;
- elseif the UE is configured with pusch-AggregationFactor, the number of repetitions \( K \) is equal to puschAggregationFactor;
- otherwise \( K=1 \).
- the number of slots used for TBS determination \( N \) is equal to 1 .

For PUSCH repetition type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, the 2 MSBs of the MCS information field of the RAR UL grant provide a codepoint to determine the number of repetitions \( K \) according to Table
