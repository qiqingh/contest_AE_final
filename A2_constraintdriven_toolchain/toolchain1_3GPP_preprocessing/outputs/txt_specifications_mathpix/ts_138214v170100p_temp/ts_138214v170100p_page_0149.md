- When \( \mathrm{K}>2 \) and sequentialMapping in PUSCH-Config is enabled, the second SRS resource set is applied to the first and second slot of K consecutive slots, and the first SRS resource set is applied to the third and fourth slot of K consecutive slots, and the same SRS resource set mapping pattern continues to the remaining slots of the K consecutive slots.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when two SRS resource sets are configured in srs-ResourceSetToAddModList or srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2 with higher layer parameter usage in SRS-ResourceSet set to 'codebook' or 'noncodebook', the SRS resource set association to nominal PUSCH repetitions follows the same method as SRS resource set association to slots in PUSCH Type A repetition by considering nominal repetitions instead of slots.

For both PUSCH repetition Type A and PUSCH repetition Type B, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) or DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint "10" or "11" for the SRS resource set indicator, the redundancy version to be applied on the \( n \)th transmission occasion (for PUSCH repetition Type A) of the TB, where \( n=0,1, \ldots K-1 \), or \( n \)th actual repetition (for PUSCH repetition Type B , with the counting including the actual repetitions that are omitted) is determined according to Table 6.1.2.1-2 and Table 6.1.2.1-3. For all PUSCH repetitions associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to Table 6.1.2.1-2, where \( n \) is counted only considering PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions associated with the same SRS resource set as the first transmission occasion or actual repetition. The redundancy version for PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions that are associated with an SRS resource set other than the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition is derived according to Table 6.1.2.1-3, where additional shifting operation for each redundancy version \( r v_{s} \) is configured by higher layer parameter sequenceOffsetforRV in PUSCH-Config and \( n \) is counted only considering PUSCH transmission occasions or actual repetitions that are not associated with the SRS resource set of the first transmission occasion or actual repetition.

For PUSCH repetition Type A, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 10 " or " 11 " for the SRS resource set indicator and schedules aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH with transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the CSI report(s) multiplexing is determined as follows
- if higher layer paremeter AP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is enabled and UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is transmitted separately only on the first transmission occasion associated with the first SRS resource set and the first transmission occasion associated with the second SRS resource set.
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is transmitted only on the first transmission occasion.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 10 " or " 11 " for the SRS resource set indicator and schedules aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH with transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, CSI report(s) multiplexing is determined as follows
- if higher layer paremeter AP-CSI-MultiplexingMode in CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList is enabled and the first actual repetition associated with the first SRS resource set and the first actual repetition associated with the second SRS resource set have the same number of symbols and UCI other than CSI report(s) are not multiplexed on PUSCH, the CSI report(s) is multiplexed separately only on the first actual repetition associated with the first SRS resource set and first actual repetition associated with the second SRS resource set.
- otherwise, the CSI report(s) is multiplexed only on the first actual repetition.

For PUSCH repetition Type A, when a DCI format \( 0 \_1 \) and DCI format \( 0 \_2 \) indicates codepoint " 10 " or " 11 " for the SRS resource set indicator and schedules aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH with no transport block by a 'CSI request' field on a DCI, the number of repetitions is assumed to be 2 regardless of the value of numberOfRepetitions or pusch-
