used for determining \( n r \)-RSTD or \( n r \)-UE-RxTxTimeDiff. For UE positioning measurement reporting in higher layer parameters NR-DL-TDOA-SignalMeasurementInformation or NR-Multi-RTT-SignalMeasurementInformation, the UE may be configured to measure and report, subject to UE capability, the DL PRS-RSRPP of the first path and the up to 8 additional paths that are associated with each RSTD or UE Rx-Tx time difference.

The UE may be requested, subject to UE capability, to measure and report one or more of the DL RSTD, DL PRSRSRP, or UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements with either 1 or 4 samples, as defined in [11, TS 38.133], via higher layer parameter [numOfSamples-perMeasurement] [17, TS 37.355] which applies for all DL PRS positioning frequency layers.

The UE may be requested, subject to UE capability, to report LoS/NLoS indicator(s) via higher layer parameter [losNlosIndicator-Request]. The UE can report LoS/NLoS indicator(s) via higher layer parameter [losNlosIndicator] associated with each DL RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP, and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements. The UE can report LoS/NLoS indicator(s) via higher layer parameter [ \( \operatorname{losNlosIndicator]} \) associated with each \( d l \)-PRS-ID in a measurement report. For the LoS/NLoS indicator(s) associated with DL RSTD, the UE may report one indicator associated with the dl-PRS-ID indicated by higher layer parameter dl-PRS-Referencelnfo and one indicator associated with the dl-PRS-ID of the DL RSTD measurement. A UE may be provided with LoS/NLoS indicator(s) via higher layer parameter [losNlosIndicator], and it may be associated with each DL PRS resource of each configured dl-PRS-ID or may be associated with each configured dl-PRS-ID. The values of the higher layer parameter [losNlosIndicator] may be soft values \( ([0,0.1, \ldots, 0.9,1]) \) or hard values \( ([0,1]) \) with the values corresponding to the likelihood of \( \operatorname{LoS} \), with a value of 1 corresponding to LoS and a value of 0 corresponding to NLoS.

If the UE is configured with DL-PRS-QCL-Info and the QCL relation is between two DL PRS resources, then the UE assumes those DL PRS resources are associated with the same \( d l \)-PRS-ID. If DL-PRS-QCL-Info is configured to the UE with QCL set to 'type-D' with a source DL PRS resource then the nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSetId and the nr-DL-PRSResourceld of the source DL PRS resource are expected to be indicated to the UE.

The UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap, subject to UE capability, if the DL PRS is inside the active DL BWP and has the same numerology as the active DL BWP and is within the DL PRS processing window indicated by higher layer parameter [PRSProcessing Window]. For receiving the DL PRS outside the measurement gap and within the DL PRS processing window, if the UE determines the DL PRS priority is higher than [other DL signals or channels except SSB] as indicated by higher layer parameter [PRS-priority-indicator] or as implied by UE capability, the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS; otherwise, the UE is not expected to measure the DL PRS and expected to receive [other DL signals and channels], subject to UE capabilities. Inside one instance of the [PRSProcessingWindow] the UE is only expected to measure a single DL PRS positioning frequency layer.

When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-1A] and if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels are not expected to be measured by the UE. When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-1B] and if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels in the same band as the DL PRS are not expected to be measured by the UE. When the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS outside the measurement gap in a configured PRS processing window with [Type-2] if the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority than the DL signals and channels inside the PRS processing window, those DL signals and channels from the impacted serving cells are not expected to be measured by the UE on the overlapped symbols with the DL PRS, where impacted serving cells refer to the serving cell on which the [PRSProcessingWindow] is configured for a frequency range 1 band, and all the serving cells in the same band as the DL PRS for a frequency range 2 band.

Within a positioning frequency layer, the DL PRS resources are sorted in the decreasing order of priority for measurement to be performed by the UE, with the reference indicated by \( n r-D L-P R S \)-Referencelnfo being the highest priority for measurement, and the following priority is assumed:
- Up to 64 NR-SelectedDL-PRS-IndexPerTRP of the frequency layer are sorted according to priority if \( n r \) -SelectedDL-PRS-IndexListPerFreq is provided, or up to 64 NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceDataPerTRP of the frequency layer are sorted according to priority otherwise;
- Up to 2 DL-SelectedPRS-ResourceSetIndex per dl-PRS-ID of the frequency layer are sorted according to priority if dl-SelectedPRS-ResourceSetIndexList is provided, or up to 2 NR-DL-PRS-ResourceSet per dl-PRS-ID of the frequency layer are sorted according to priority otherwise.

For the case when measurement gap is configured, the UE DL PRS processing capability is defined in [TS 37.355]. For the purpose of DL PRS processing capability, the duration \( K \) msec of DL PRS symbols within \( P \) msec window, is calculated by
