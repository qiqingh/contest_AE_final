- \( \mu_{0} \) is the largest \( \mu \) value among the subcarrier spacing configurations by the higher-layer parameter \( s c s \) SpecificCarrierList;
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{Start}} \) is the lowest numbered resource block of the initial uplink bandwidth part and is derived by the higherlayer parameter mitialUplinkBWP or mittalUplinkBWP-RedCap during initial access. Otherwise, \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}} \) is the lowest numbered resource block of the active uplink bandwidth part and is derived by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Uplink;
- \( n_{\mathrm{RA}}^{\mathrm{start}} \) is the frequency offset of the lowest PRACH transmission occasion in frequency domain with respect to physical resource block 0 of the active uplink bandwidth part. The quantity \( n_{\mathrm{RA}}^{\mathrm{start}} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter \( m s g A \)-RO-FrequencyStart if configured and a type-2 random-access procedure is initiated as described in clause 8.1 of [5, TS 38.213], otherwise by msg 1-FrequencyStart as described in clause 8.1 of [5 TS 38.213];
- \( n_{R A} \) is the PRACH transmission occasion index in frequency domain for a given PRACH transmission occasion in one time instance as given by clause 6.3.3.2;
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\mathrm{RA}} \) is the number of resource blocks occupied and is given by the parameter allocation expressed in number of RBs for PUSCH in Table 6.3.3.2-1.
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{RB}, \mathrm{UL}, n}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \) is the start CRB index of uplink RB set \( n \) corresponding to the quantity \( R B_{n, \mathrm{UL}}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \). The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided IntraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in Clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214]
- \( n_{0} \) is the index of the RB set which contains the lowest PRACH transmission occasion in frequency domain indicated by \( n_{R A}^{\text {start }} \). The UE may assume that \( n_{R A}^{\text {start }} \) is configured such that each PRACH transmission occasion is fully contained within an RB set.
- \( \quad L_{\text {RA }} \) and \( N_{u} \) are given by clause 6.3.3
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{CP}, l}^{\mathrm{RA}}=N_{\mathrm{CP}}^{\mathrm{RA}}+n \cdot 16 \kappa \) where
- for \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{1.25,5\} \mathrm{kHz}, n=0 \)
- for \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{15,30,60,120,480,960\} \mathrm{kHz}, n \) is the number of times the interval \( \left[t_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{RA}}, t_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{RA}}+\right. \left.\left(N_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{RA}}+N_{\mathrm{CP}}^{\mathrm{RA}}\right) T_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \) overlaps with either time instance 0 or time instance \( \left(\Delta f_{\max } N_{\mathrm{f}} / 2000\right) \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}}=0.5 \mathrm{~ms} \) in a subframe

The starting position \( t_{\text {start }}^{\mathrm{RA}} \) of the PRACH preamble in a subframe (for \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{1.25,5,15,30\} \mathrm{kHz} \) ) or in a 60 kHz slot (for \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{60,120,480,960\} \mathrm{kHz} \) ) is given by
\[
\begin{array}{l}
t_{\text {slarl }}^{\mathrm{RA}}=t_{\text {slarl }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mu} \\
t_{\text {sarl }, \mathrm{l}}^{\mu}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & l=0 \\
t_{\text {slarl }, \mathrm{l}-1}^{\mu}+\left(N_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mu}+N_{\mathrm{CP}, \mathrm{l}-1}^{\mu}\right) \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\]
where
- the subframe or 60 kHz slot is assumed to start at \( t=0 \);
- a timing advance value \( N_{\mathrm{TA}}=0 \) shall be assumed;
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mu} \) and \( N_{\mathrm{CP}, l-1}^{\mu} \) are given by clause 5.3.1;
- \( \mu=0 \) shall be assumed for \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{1.25,5\} \mathrm{kHz} \), otherwise the value of \( \mu \) corresponds to \( \Delta f_{\mathrm{RA}} \in \{15,30,60,120,480,960\} \mathrm{kHz} \) and the symbol position / is given by
\[
l=l_{0}+n_{t}^{\mathrm{RA}} N_{\mathrm{dur}}^{\mathrm{RA}}+14 n_{\mathrm{slot}}^{\mathrm{RA}}
\]
