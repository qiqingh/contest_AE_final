7.4.1.2 Phase-tracking reference signals for PDSCH
7.4.1.2.1 Sequence generation

The phase-tracking reference signal for subcarrier \( k \) is given by
- If the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeEnh is configured
\[
r_{k}=r\left(4 m+k^{\prime}\right)
\]
- otherwise
\[
r_{k}=r\left(2 m+k^{\prime}\right)
\]
where \( r(\cdot) \) is the demodulation reference signal given by clause 7.4.1.1.2 at position \( l_{0} \) and subcarrier \( k \).
7.4.1.2.2 Mapping to physical resources

The UE shall assume phase-tracking reference signals being present only in the resource blocks used for the PDSCH, and only if the procedure in [6, TS 38.214] indicates phase-tracking reference signals being used.

If present, the UE shall assume the PDSCH PT-RS is scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\mathrm{PT}-\mathrm{RS}, i} \) to conform with the transmission power specified in clause 4.1 of \( \left[6\right. \), TS 38.214] and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) according to
\[
a_{k, l}^{(p, \mu)}=\beta_{\mathrm{PT}-\mathrm{RS}, i} r_{k}
\]
when all the following conditions are fulfilled
- \( l \) is within the OFDM symbols allocated for the PDSCH transmission
- resource element \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) is not used for DM-RS, non-zero-power CSI-RS (except for those configured for mobility measurements or with resourceType in corresponding CSI-ResourceConfig configured as 'aperiodic'), zero-power CSI-RS, SS/PBCH block, a detected PDCCH according to clause 5.1.4.1 of [6, TS38.214], or is declared as 'not available' by clause 5.1 . 4 of [6, TS 38.214]

The set of time indices \( l \) defined relative to the start of the PDSCH allocation is defined by
1. Set \( i=0 \) and \( l_{\text {ref }}=0 \)
2. if any symbol in the interval \( \max \left(l_{\text {ref }}+(i-1) L_{\text {PT-RS }}+1, l_{\text {ref }}\right), \ldots, l_{\text {ref }}+i L_{\text {PT-RS }} \) overlaps with a symbol used for DM-RS according to clause 7.4.1.1.2
- set \( i=1 \)
- Set \( l_{\text {ref }} \) to the symbol index of the DM-RS symbol in case of a single-symbol DM-RS and to the symbol index of the second DM-RS symbol in case of a double-symbol DM-RS
- repeat from step 2 as long as \( l_{\text {ref }}+i L_{\text {PT-RS }} \) is inside the PDSCH allocation
3. add \( l_{\text {ref }}+i L_{\text {PT-RS }} \) to the set of time indices for PT-RS
4. increment \( i \) by one
5. repeat from step 2 above as long as \( l_{\text {ref }}+i L_{\text {PT-RS }} \) is inside the PDSCH allocation
where \( L_{\mathrm{PT}-\mathrm{RS}} \in\{1,2,4\} \).
For the purpose of PT -RS mapping, the resource blocks allocated for PDSCH transmission are numbered from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}-1 \) from the lowest scheduled resource block to the highest. The corresponding subcarriers in this set of resource blocks are numbered in increasing order starting from the lowest frequency from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}} N_{\mathrm{RB}}-1 \). The subcarriers to which the UE shall assume the PT-RS is mapped are given by
