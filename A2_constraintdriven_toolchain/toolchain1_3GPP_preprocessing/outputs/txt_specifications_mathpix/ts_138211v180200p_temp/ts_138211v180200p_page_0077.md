ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05)
- for Table 6.3.3.2-3 given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationIndex, or by msgA-PRACHConfigurationIndex if configured; and
- for Tables 6.3.3.2-2 and 6.3.3.2-4 given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationIndex, or by msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex if configured.

For the IAB-MT part of an IAB-node, the following applies:
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationPeriodScaling-IAB is configured, the variable \( x \) used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \) of Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}} \), where \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}}=\delta x \) and \( \delta \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationPeriodScaling-IAB and the [AB-node does not expect \( x_{\mathrm{JAB}} \) to be larger than 64 ;
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationFrameOffset-IAB is configured, the variable \( y \) used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \) of Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( y_{\text {IAB }}=(y+\Delta y) \bmod x \) where \( \Delta y \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationFrameOffset-IAB, and \( x \) is the value used in \( n_{\mathrm{f}} \bmod x=y \);
- if the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationSOffset-IAB is configured, the subframe number \( s_{n} \) from Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-3 and the slot number \( s_{\mathrm{n}} \) from Table 6.3.3.2-4 shall be replaced by \( \left(s_{\mathrm{n}}+\Delta s\right) \bmod L \) where \( \Delta s \in\{0,1, \ldots, L-1\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter prach-ConfigurationSOffset-IAB, and \( L \) is the number of subframes in a frame when using Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-3 and the number of slots in a frame for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing when using in Table 6.3.3.2-4.

Random access preambles can only be transmitted in the frequency resources given by either the higher-layer parameter msg1-FrequencyStart or msgA-RO-FrequencyStart if configured as described in clause 8.1 of [5 TS 38.213]. The PRACH frequency resources \( n_{\mathrm{RA}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, M-1\} \), where \( M \) equals the higher-layer parameter msgl-FDM or msgA-RO-FDM if configured, are numbered in increasing order within the initial uplink bandwidth part during initial access, starting from the lowest frequency. Otherwise, \( n_{\mathrm{RA}} \) are numbered in increasing order within the active uplink bandwidth part, starting from the lowest frequency.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, for \( L_{R A}=139 \), a UE expects to be provided with higher-layer parameter msgl-FrequencyStart or msgA-RO-FrequencyStart if configured, and higher-layer parameter msgl-FDM or \( m s g A-R O-F D M \) if configured, such that a random-access preamble is confined within a single RB set. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in Clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214].

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, for \( L_{R A}=571 \) or 1151 and Type-2 random access, a UE expects to be provided with higher-layer parameter \( m s g A-R O-F D M \) equals to one.

For the purpose of slot numbering in the tables, the following subcarrier spacing shall be assumed:
- 15 kHz for FR1
- 60 kHz for FR2.

For handover purposes to a target cell in paired or unpaired spectrum where the target cell uses \( L_{\text {max }}=4 \), the UE may assume the absolute value of the time difference between radio frame \( i \) in the current cell and radio frame \( i \) in the target cell is less than \( 153600 T_{\mathrm{s}} \) if the association pattern period in clause 8.1 of [ 5 , TS 38.213] is not equal to 10 ms .

For inter frequency handover purposes where the source cell is either in paired or unpaired spectrum and the target cell is in unpaired spectrum and uses \( L_{\text {max }}=8 \), the UE may assume the absolute value of the time difference between radio frame \( i \) in the current cell and radio frame \( i \) in the target cell is less than \( 76800 T_{\mathrm{s}} \).
