8.4.3.2 Time location of an S-SS/PSBCH block

The locations in the time domain where a UE shall monitor for a possible S-SS/PSBCH block are described in clause 16.1 of [5, TS 38.213].
8.5 Timing

Transmission of a sidelink radio frame number \( i \) from the UE shall start \( \left(N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{SL}}+N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }}\right) \cdot T_{\mathrm{c}} \) seconds before the start of the corresponding timing reference frame at the UE. The UE is not required to receive sidelink or downlink transmissions earlier than the value of \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{offset}} \), which is given in [12, TS 38.133], after the end of a sidelink transmission.

For sidelink transmissions:
If the UE has a serving cell fulfilling the \( S \) criterion according to clause 8.2 of [13, TS 38.304]
- The timing of reference radio frame \( i \) equals that of downlink radio frame \( i \) in the cell with the same uplink carrier frequency as the sidelink and
- \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \text { offset }} \) is given by clause 4.3.1 of [TS 38.211],

Otherwise
- The timing of reference radio frame \( i \) and \( N_{\mathrm{TA}, \mathrm{off}} \) value are given by clause 12.2.2, 12.2.3, 12.2.4 or 12.2.5 of [12, TS 38.133].

The quantity \( N_{\text {TA }, \mathrm{SL}} \) equals to 0 .
