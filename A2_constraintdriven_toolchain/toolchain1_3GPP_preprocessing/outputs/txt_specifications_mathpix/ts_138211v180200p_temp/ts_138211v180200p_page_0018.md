- when the lowest subcarrier spacing configuration among the subcarrier spacings configured for the cell is \( \mu=2 \) for both cells or \( \mu=3 \) for both cells, the start of slot 0 for the cell whose point A has a lower frequency coincides with the start of slot \( q N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }} \mu_{\text {offset }} \) for the other cell where \( q=-1 \) if point A of the PCell/PSCell has a frequency lower than the frequency of point A for the SCell, otherwise \( q=1 \);
- otherwise, the start of slot 0 for the cell with the lower subcarrier spacing of the lowest subcarrier spacing given by the higher-layer parameters scs-SpecificCarrierList configured for the two cells, or the Pcell/PSCell if both cells have the same lowest subcarrier spacing given by the higher-layer parameters scs-SpecificCarrierList configured for the two cells, coincides with the start of slot \( q N_{\text {slot, offset }}^{\mathrm{CA}} \bmod N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }} \mu_{\text {offset }} \) for the other cell where \( q=-1 \) if the lowest subcarreier spacing configuration given by scs-SpecificCarrierList of the PCell/PSCell is smaller than or equal to the lowest subcarrier spacing given by scs-SpectficCarrierList for the SCell, otherwise \( q=1 \).

5 Generic functions
5.1 Modulation mapper

The modulation mapper takes binary digits, 0 or 1 , as input and produces complex-valued modulation symbols as output.
5.1.1 π/2-BPSK

In case of \( \pi / 2 \)-BPSK modulation, bit \( b(i) \) is mapped to complex-valued modulation symbol \( d(i) \) according to
\[
d(i)=\frac{e^{j \frac{\pi}{2}(i \bmod 2)}}{\sqrt{2}}[(1-2 b(i))+j(1-2 b(i))]
\]
5.1.2 BPSK

In case of BPSK modulation, bit \( b(i) \) is mapped to complex-valued modulation symbol \( d(i) \) according to
\[
d(i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[(1-2 b(i))+j(1-2 b(i))]
\]
5.1.3 QPSK

In case of QPSK modulation, pairs of bits, \( b(2 i), b(2 i+1) \), are mapped to complex-valued modulation symbols \( d(i) \) according to
\[
d(i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[(1-2 b(2 i))+j(1-2 b(2 i+1))]
\]
5.1.4 16QAM

In case of 16 QAM modulation, quadruplets of bits, \( b(4 i), b(4 i+1), b(4 i+2), b(4 i+3) \), are mapped to complex-valued modulation symbols \( d(i) \) according to
\[
d(i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\{(1-2 b(4 i))[2-(1-2 b(4 i+2))]+j(1-2 b(4 i+1))[2-(1-2 b(4 i+3))]\}
\]
