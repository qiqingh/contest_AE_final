symbols are within a S-SS/PSBCH block transmitted within the same slot, and with the same block index according to clause 8.4.3.1.

For DM-RS associated with a PSSCH, the channel over which a PSSCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same frequency resource as the scheduled PSSCH and in the same slot.

For DM-RS associated with a PSCCH, the channel over which a PSCCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same frequency resource as the transmitted PSCCH and in the same slot.
8.2.5 Resource grid

The resource grid for sidelink transmission is defined in clause 4.4.2.
For sidelink, the carrier bandwidth \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {size }, \mu} \) and the starting position \( N_{\text {grid }}^{\text {start }, \mu} \) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) are obtained from the higher-layer parameter \( s l \)-SCS-SpecificCarrierList.

For the sidelink, the higher-layer parameter sl-TxDirectCurrentLocation indicates the location of the transmitter DC subcarrier in the sidelink for each of the configured bandwidth parts. Values in the range \( 0-3299 \) represent the number of the DC subcarrier, the value 3300 indicates that the DC subcarrier is located outside the resource grid, and the value 3301 indicates that the position of the DC subcarrier in the sidelink is undetermined. The DC subcarrier location offset relative to the center of the indicated subcarrier is given by \( 7.5+5 N \mathrm{kHz} \) if frequencyShift \( 7 p 5 k h z S L \) is provided and by \( 5 N \mathrm{kHz} \) otherwise, where \( N \in\{-1,0,1\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter value \( N \).
8.2.6 Resource elements

Resource elements are defined in clause 4.4.3.
8.2.7 Resource blocks

Resource blocks are defined in clause 4.4.4.
Point A for sidelink transmission/reception is obtained from the higher-layer parameter s \( l \)-AbsoluteFrequencyPointA.
8.2.8 Bandwidth part

Configuration of the single bandwidth part for sidelink transmission is described in clause 16 of [5, TS 38.213].
8.3 Physical channels
8.3.1 Physical sidelink shared channel
8.3.1.1 Scrambling

For the single codeword \( q=0 \), the block of bits \( b^{(q)}(0), \ldots, b^{(q)}\left(M_{\mathrm{bit}}^{(q)}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\mathrm{bit}}^{(q)}=M_{\mathrm{bit}, \mathrm{SCl} 2}^{(q)}+M_{\mathrm{bit}, \mathrm{data}}^{(q)} \) is the number of bits in codeword \( q \) transmitted on the physical channel as defined in [4, TS 38.212], shall be scrambled prior to modulation.

Scrambling shall be done according to the following pseudo code
```
set \( i=0 \)
set \( j=0 \)
while \( i<M_{\text {bit }}^{(q)} \)
    if \( b^{(q)}(i)=x / / \) SCI placeholder bits
```
