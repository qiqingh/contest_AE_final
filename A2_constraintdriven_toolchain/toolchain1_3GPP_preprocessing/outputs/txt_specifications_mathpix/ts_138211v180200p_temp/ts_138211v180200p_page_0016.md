4.4.4 Resource blocks
4.4.4.1 General

A resource block is defined as \( N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}=12 \) consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain.
4.4.4.2 Point A

Point A serves as a common reference point for resource block grids and is obtained from:
- offsetToPointA for a PCell downlink where offsetToPointA represents the frequency offset between point A and the lowest subcarrier of the lowest resource block, which overlaps with the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, used by the UE for initial cell selection, expressed in units of resource blocks assuming 15 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR1 and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing for FR2;
- for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon;
- for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 or FR2, and for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, the lowest resource block has the subcarrier spacing same as the SS/PBCH block used by the UE for initial cell selection;
- absoluteFrequencyPointA for all other cases where absoluteFrequencyPointA represents the frequency-location of point A expressed as in ARFCN.
4.4.4.3 Common resource blocks

Common resource blocks are numbered from 0 and upwards in the frequency domain for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \). The center of subcarrier 0 of common resource block 0 for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) coincides with 'point A'.

The relation between the common resource block number \( n_{\text {CRB }}^{\mu} \) in the frequency domain and resource elements ( \( k, l \) ) for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mu}=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}}\right\rfloor
\]
where \( k \) is defined relative to point A such that \( k=0 \) corresponds to the subcarrier centered around point A .
4.4.4.4 Physical resource blocks

Physical resource blocks for subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \) are defined within a bandwidth part and numbered from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{size}, \mu}-1 \) where \( i \) is the number of the bandwidth part. The relation between the physical resource block \( n_{\mathrm{PRB}}^{\mu} \) in band width part \( i \) and the common resource block \( n_{\text {CRB }}^{\mu} \) is given by
\[
n_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mu}=n_{\mathrm{PRB}}^{\mu}+N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu}
\]
where \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\mathrm{start}, \mu} \) is the common resource block where band width part \( i \) starts relative to common resource block 0 . When there is no risk for confusion the index \( \mu \) may be dropped.
4.4.4.5 Virtual resource blocks

Virtual resource blocks are defined within a bandwidth part and numbered from 0 to \( N_{\mathrm{BWP}, i}^{\text {size }}-1 \) where \( i \) is the number of the bandwidth part.
4.4.4.6 Interlaced resource blocks

Multiple interlaces of resource blocks are defined where interlace \( m \in\{0,1, \ldots, M-1\} \) consists of common resource blocks \( \{m, M+m, 2 M+m, 3 M+m, \ldots\} \), with \( M \) being the number of interlaces given by Table 4.4.4.6-1. The relation
