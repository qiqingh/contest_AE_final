- \( \quad t_{\text {start }, l_{0}}^{\mathrm{RIM}}=t_{\text {start }, l}^{\mu} \) is given by clause 5.3.1 with \( l=l_{0} \);
- \( \quad N_{\mathrm{CP}, l_{0}}^{\mathrm{RIM}}=N_{\mathrm{CP}, l}^{\mu} \) is given by clause 5.3 .1 with \( l=l_{0} \).
5.4 Modulation and upconversion

Modulation and upconversion to the carrier frequency \( f_{0} \) of the complex-valued OFDM baseband signal for antenna port \( p \), subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \), and OFDM symbol \( l \) in a subframe assumed to start at \( t=0 \) is given by
- for PRACH
\[
\operatorname{Re}\left\{s_{l}^{(p, \mu)}(t) e^{j 2 \pi f_{0} t}\right\}
\]
- for RIM-RS
\[
\operatorname{Re}\left\{s_{l}^{(p, \mu)}(t) e^{j 2 \pi f_{0}^{\mathbf{R I M}}\left(t-t_{\mathrm{start}, l_{0}}^{\mu}-N_{\mathrm{CP}}^{\mathbf{R I M}} T_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}\right\}
\]
where \( f_{0}^{\mathrm{RIM}} \) is the configured reference point for RIM-RS;
- for all other channels and signals
\[
\operatorname{Re}\left\{s_{l}^{(p, \mu)}(t) \cdot e^{j 2 \pi f_{0}\left(t-t_{\mathrm{starl}, j}^{\mu}-N_{\mathrm{CP},}^{\mu} T_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}\right\}
\]

NOTE: For the uplink, the signal \( s_{l}^{(p, \mu)}(t) \) and the baseband signals part thereof should be filtered per UE implementation, as required, to meet the minimum requirements as specified in [38.101-1] and [38.101-2] for the respective frequency range.

6 Uplink
6.1 Overview
6.1.1 Overview of physical channels

An uplink physical channel corresponds to a set of resource elements carrying information originating from higher layers. The following uplink physical channels are defined:
- Physical Uplink Shared Channel, PUSCH
- Physical Uplink Control Channel, PUCCH
- Physical Random Access Channel, PRACH
6.1.2 Overview of physical signals

An uplink physical signal is used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating from higher layers. The following uplink physical signals are defined:
- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS
- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS
- Sounding reference signal, SRS
