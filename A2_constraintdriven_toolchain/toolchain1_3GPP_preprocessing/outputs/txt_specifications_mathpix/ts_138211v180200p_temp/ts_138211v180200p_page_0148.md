- for SS/PBCH block type A, \( \mu \in\{0,1\} \) and \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \in\{0,1,2, \ldots, 23\} \) with the quantities \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \), and \( N_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\mathrm{SSB}} \) expressed in terms of 15 kHz subcarrier spacing, and
- for SS/PBCH block type B in FR2-1, \( \mu \in\{3,4\} \) and \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \in\{0,1,2, \ldots, 11\} \) with the quantity \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) expressed in terms of the subcarrier spacing provided by the higher-layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon and \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of 60 kHz subcarrier spacing;
- for SS/PBCH block type B in FR2-2, \( \mu \in\{3,5,6\} \) and \( k_{\text {SSB }} \in\{0,1,2, \ldots, 11\} \) with the quantity \( k_{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of the SS/PBCH block subcarrier spacing and \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) expressed in terms of 60 kHz subcarrier spacing;
- the centre of subcarrier 0 of resource block \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) coincides with the centre of subcarrier 0 of a common resource block with the subcarrier spacing
- provided by the higher-layer parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1; and
- same as the subcarrier spacing of the SS/PBCH block for operation without shared spectrum access in FR2-2 and for operation with shared spectrum channel access.
- This common resource block overlaps with subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block of the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable.

The UE may assume that SS/PBCH blocks transmitted with the same block index on the same center frequency location are quasi co-located with respect to Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters. The UE shall not assume quasi co-location for any other SS/PBCH block transmissions other than what is specified in [5, TS 38.213].

For cell search on a carrier with a channel bandwidth of 3 MHz , the UE is not expected to receive subcarriers 0 to 47 and 192 to 239 in any of the 4 OFDM symbols of the SS/PBCH block, where the remaining 12 resource blocks form the SS/PBCH block after puncturing.

7.4.3.1.1 Mapping of PSS within an SS/PBCH block

The UE shall assume the sequence of symbols \( d_{\mathrm{PSS}}(0), \ldots, d_{\mathrm{PSS}}(126) \) constituting the primary synchronization signal to be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\text {PSS }} \) to conform to the PSS power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of \( k \) where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block.
7.4.3.1.2 Mapping of SSS within an SS/PBCH block

The UE shall assume the sequence of symbols \( d_{\mathrm{SSS}}(0), \ldots, d_{\mathrm{SSS}}(126) \) constituting the secondary synchronization signal to be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\text {SSS }} \) and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of \( k \) where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block.
