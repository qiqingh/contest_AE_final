7.4.3.1.3 Mapping of PBCH and DM-RS within an SS/PBCH block

The UE shall assume the sequence of complex-valued symbols \( d_{\text {PBCH }}(0), \ldots, d_{\text {PBCH }}\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) constituting the physical broadcast channel to be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\text {PBCH }} \) to conform to the PBCH power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( d_{\mathrm{PBCH}}(0) \) to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) which meet all the following criteria:
- they are not used for PBCH demodulation reference signals

The mapping to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) not reserved for PBCH DM-RS shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k \) and then the index \( l \), where \( k \) and \( l \) represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block and are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1.

The UE shall assume the sequence of complex-valued symbols \( r(0), \ldots, r(143) \) constituting the demodulation reference signals for the SS/PBCH block to be scaled by a factor of \( \beta_{\text {PBCH }}^{\text {DM-RS }} \) to conform to the PBCH power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and to be mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of first \( k \) and then \( l \) where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 7.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block.
7.4.3.2 Time location of an SS/PBCH block

The locations in the time domain where a UE shall monitor for a possible SS/PBCH block are described in clause 4.1 of [5, TS 38.213].

8 Sidelink
8.1 Overview
8.1.1 Overview of physical channels

A sidelink physical channel corresponds to a set of resource elements carrying information originating from higher layers. The following sidelink physical channels are defined:
- Physical Sidelink Shared Channel, PSSCH
- Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel, PSBCH
- Physical Sidelink Control Channel, PSCCH
- Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel, PSFCH
8.1.2 Overview of physical signals

A sidelink physical signal corresponds to a set of resource elements used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating from higher layers.

The following sidelink physical signals are defined:
- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS
- Channel-state information reference signal, CSI-RS
- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS
- Sidelink primary synchronization signal, S-PSS
- Sidelink secondary synchronization signal, S-SSS
- Sidelink positioning reference signal, SL PRS
