where \( i=0,1, \ldots, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}=M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }} \). The set of antenna ports \( \left\{p_{0, \ldots,} p_{v-1}\right\} \) shall be determined according to the procedure in [4, TS 38.212].
7.3.1.5 Mapping to virtual resource blocks

The UE shall, for each of the antenna ports used for transmission of the physical channel, assume the block of complexvalued symbols \( y^{(p)}(0), \ldots, y^{(p)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1\right) \) conform to the downlink power allocation specified in [6, TS 38.214] and are mapped in sequence starting with \( y^{(p)}(0) \) to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission which meet all of the following criteria:
- they are in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission;
- the corresponding physical resource blocks are declared as available for PDSCH according to clause 5.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214];
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are
- not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS or DM-RS intended for other co-scheduled UEs as described in clause 7.4.1.1.2;
- not used for non-zero-power CSI-RS, which is according to clause 7.4.1.5 and not configured by TRSResourceSet IE, if the corresponding physical resource blocks are for a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH with the CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI for multicast, G-CS-RNTI, or a PDSCH with SPS, except if the non-zero-power CSI-RS is a CSI-RS configured by the higher-layer parameter CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility in the MeasObjectNR IE or except if the non-zero-power CSI-RS is an aperiodic non-zero-power CSI-RS resource;
- not used for PT-RS according to clause 7.4.1.2;
- not declared as 'not available for PDSCH according to clause 5.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214].

The mapping to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) allocated for PDSCH according to [6, TS 38.214] and not reserved for other purposes shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks, where \( k^{\prime}=0 \) is the first subcarrier in the lowest-numbered virtual resource block assigned for transmission, and then the index \( l \).
7.3.1.6 Mapping from virtual to physical resource blocks

The UE shall assume the virtual resource blocks are mapped to physical resource blocks according to the indicated mapping scheme, non-interleaved or interleaved mapping. If no mapping scheme is indicated, the UE shall assume noninterleaved mapping.

For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n \), except for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format \( 1 \_0 \) in a common search space in which case virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n+N_{\text {start }}^{\text {COREST }} \) where \( N_{\text {start }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) is the lowest-numbered physical resource block in the control resource set where the corresponding DCI was received. When two PDCCH candidates from two linked common search space sets as indicated by the higher-layer parameter searchSpaceLinking are detected, and the two linked common search space sets are associated with different control resource sets, the control resource set with the lowest number among the two linked control resource sets is used to determine \( N_{\text {start }}^{\text {CORESET }} \).

For interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, the mapping process is defined by:
- Resource block bundles are defined as
- for PDSCH transmissions scheduled with DCI format 1_0 with the CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI in Type0PDCCH common search space in CORESET 0 , the set of \( N_{\text {BWP, init }}^{\text {size }} \) resource blocks in CORESET 0 are
