- \( m_{\mathrm{cs}} \) is given by clause 16.3 of [5, TS 38.213];
- \( m_{0} \) is given by clause 16.3 of [5, TS 38.213];
- \( m_{\text {int }} \) is given by
- \( m_{\mathrm{int}}=5 n_{\mathrm{IRB}}^{\mu} \) if the higher-layer parameter sl-PSFCH-Type is configured and set to 'typel' and where \( n_{\mathrm{IRB}}^{\mu} \) is the resource block number within the interlace;
- \( m_{\text {int }}=0 \) otherwise
- \( l=0 \);
- \( l^{\prime} \) is the index of the OFDM symbol in the slot that corresponds to the second OFDM symbol of the PSFCH transmission in the slot given by [5, TS 38.213];
- \( u=n_{\mathrm{lD}} \bmod 30 \) and \( v=0 \) with \( n_{\mathrm{lD}} \) given by the higher-layer parameter sl-PSFCH-HopID if configured; otherwise, \( u=0 \).
- \( \quad c_{\mathrm{init}}=n_{\mathrm{lD}} \) with \( n_{\mathrm{lD}} \) given by the higher-layer parameter sl-PSFCH-HopID if configured; otherwise, \( c_{\mathrm{init}}=0 \).
8.3.4.2.2 Mapping to physical resources

The sequence \( x(n) \) shall be multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\mathrm{PSFCH}} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( x(0) \) to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) assigned for transmission of the second PSFCH symbol according to clause 16.3 of [5, TS 38.213] in increasing order of the index \( k \) over the assigned physical resources on antenna port \( p=5000 \).

The resource elements used for the PSFCH in the OFDM symbol in the mapping operation above shall be duplicated in the immediately preceding OFDM symbol.

If the higher-layer parameter sl-PSFCH-Type is configured and set to 'typel', the mapping operation shall be repeated for each resource block in the interlace and in the RB set over the assigned physical resource blocks according to clause 16.3 of [5, TS 38.213], with the resource-block dependent sequence generated according to clause 8.3.4.2.1.

If the higher-layer parameter sl-PSFCH-Type is configured and set to 'type2', the mapping operation shall be repeated for each resource block assigned for transmission of the common interlace and for PSFCH transmission with HARQACK information over the assigned physical resource according to clause 16.3 of [5, TS 38.213], with the resourceblock dependent sequence generated according to clause 8.3.4.2.1, where the cyclic shift \( \alpha \) on each resource block assigned for transmission of the common interlace is up to UE implementation.
8.4 Physical signals
8.4.1 Reference signals
8.4.1.1 Demodulation reference signals for PSSCH
8.4.1.1.1 Sequence generation

The sequence \( r_{l}(m) \) shall be generated according to
\[
r_{l}(m)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 c(2 m))+j \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 c(2 m+1))
\]
where the pseudo-random sequence \( c(m) \) is defined in clause 5.2.1. The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be initialized with
\[
c_{\text {init }}=\left(2^{17}\left(N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu}+l+1\right)\left(2 N_{\mathrm{ID}}+1\right)+2 N_{\mathrm{ID}}\right) \bmod 2^{31}
\]
