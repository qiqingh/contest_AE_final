8.3.1.3 Layer mapping

Layer mapping shall be done according to clause 7.3.1.3 with the number of layers \( v \in\{1,2\} \), resulting in \( x(i)= \left[x^{(0)}(i) \quad \ldots \quad x^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{\mathrm{T}}, i=0,1, \ldots, M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }}-1 \).
8.3.1.4 Precoding

The block of vectors \( \left[x^{(0)}(i) \quad \ldots \quad x^{(v-1)}(i)\right]^{\mathrm{T}} \) shall be precoded according to clasue 6.3.1.5 where the precoding matrix \( W \) equals the identity matrix and \( M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}=M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {layer }} \).
8.3.1.5 Mapping to virtual resource blocks

For each of the antenna ports used for transmission of the PSSCH , the block of complex-valued symbols \( Z^{(p)}(0), \ldots, Z^{(p)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1\right) \) shall be multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {DMRS }}^{\text {PSSCH }} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS 38-213] and mapped to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission, where \( k^{\prime}=0 \) is the first subcarrier in the lowest-numbered virtual resource block assigned for transmission.

The mapping operation shall be done in two steps:
- first, the complex-valued symbols corresponding to the bit for the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \)-stage SCI in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks and then the index \( l \), starting from the first PSSCH symbol carrying an associated DM-RS and meeting all of the following criteria:
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS, PT-RS, or PSCCH;
- secondly, the complex-valued modulation symbols not corresponding to the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \)-stage SCI shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks, and then the index \( l \) with the starting position given by [6, TS 38.214] and meeting all of the following criteria:
- the resource elements are not used for \( 2^{\text {nd }} \)-stage SCI in the first step;
- the resource elements are not in the \( L_{\text {SL-PRS }} \) symbols used for transmission of the associated SL PRS according to clause 8.2.4.1.1 of [6, TS 38.214];
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS, PT-RS, CSI-RS, or PSCCH.

The resource elements used for the PSSCH in the first OFDM symbol in the mapping operation above, including any DM-RS, PT-RS, or CSI-RS occurring in the first OFDM symbol, shall be duplicated in the OFDM symbol immediately preceding the first OFDM symbol in the mapping.
8.3.1.6 Mapping from virtual to physical resource blocks

Virtual resource blocks shall be mapped to physical resource blocks according to non-interleaved mapping.
For non-interleaved VRB-to-PRB mapping, virtual resource block \( n \) is mapped to physical resource block \( n \).
8.3.2 Physical sidelink control channel
8.3.2.1 Scrambling

The block of bits \( b(0), \ldots, b\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\text {bit }} \) is the number of bits transmitted on the physical channel, shall be scrambled prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) according to
\[
\tilde{b}(i)=(b(i)+c(i)) \bmod 2
\]
where the scrambling sequence \( c(i) \) is given by clause 5.2.1. The scrambling sequence generator shall be initialized with
