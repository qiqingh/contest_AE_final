ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05)
- Physical Downlink Control Channel, PDCCH.
7.1.2 Overview of physical signals

A downlink physical signal corresponds to a set of resource elements used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating from higher layers.

The following downlink physical signals are defined:
- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS
- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS
- Positioning reference signal, PRS
- Channel-state information reference signal, CSI-RS
- Primary synchronization signal, PSS
- Secondary synchronization signal, SSS
7.2 Physical resources

The frame structure and physical resources the UE shall assume when receiving downlink transmissions are defined in Clause 4.

The following antenna ports are defined for the downlink:
- Antenna ports starting with 1000 for PDSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH
- Antenna ports starting with 3000 for channel-state information reference signals
- Antenna ports starting with 4000 for SS/PBCH block transmission
- Antenna ports starting with 5000 for positioning reference signals

The UE shall not assume that two antenna ports are quasi co-located with respect to any QCL type unless specified otherwise.

For DM-RS associated with a PDSCH, the channel over which a PDSCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within the same resource as the scheduled PDSCH, in the same slot, and in the same PRG as described in clause 5.1.2.3 of [6, TS 38.214].

For DM-RS associated with a PDCCH, the channel over which a PDCCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within resources for which the UE may assume the same precoding being used as described in clause 7.3.2.2.

For DM-RS associated with a PBCH, the channel over which a PBCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two symbols are within a SS/PBCH block transmitted within the same slot, and with the same block index according to clause 7.4.3.1.
