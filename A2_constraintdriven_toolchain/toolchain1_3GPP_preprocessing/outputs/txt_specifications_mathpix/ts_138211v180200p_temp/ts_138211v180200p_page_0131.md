ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05)
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 2 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive a DM-RS symbol beyond the second symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 5 symbols and if one additional single-symbol DMRS is configured, the UE only expects the additional DM-RS to be transmitted on the 5th symbol when the front-loaded DM-RS symbol is in the 1st symbol of the PDSCH duration, otherwise the UE should expect that the additional DM-RS is not transmitted;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 7 symbols for normal cyclic prefix or 6 symbols for extended cyclic prefix:
- if one additional single-symbol DM-RS is configured, the UE only expects the additional DM-RS to be transmitted on the 5th or 6th symbol when the front-loaded DM-RS symbol is in the 1st or 2nd symbol, respectively, of the PDSCH duration, otherwise the UE should expect that the additional DM-RS is not transmitted;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in\{5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\} \) OFDM symbols, the UE is not expected to receive the front-loaded DM-RS beyond the 4th symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is 12 or 13 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive DM-RS mapped to symbol 12 or later in the slot;
- for all values of the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) other than 2,5 , and 7 symbols, the UE is not expected to receive DM-RS beyond the ( \( l_{\mathrm{d}}-1 \) ):th symbol;
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is less than or equal to 4 OFDM symbols, only single-symbol DM-RS is supported.
- if the higher-layer parameter ite-CRS-ToMatchAround, ite-CRS-PatternList 1, lte-CRS-PatternList2, ite-CRSPatternList3, or lte-CRS-PatternList4 is configured, the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=10 \) symbols for normal cyclic prefix, the subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu=0 \), single-symbol DM-RS is configured, and at least one PDSCH DM-RS symbol in the PDSCH allocation collides with a symbol containing resource elements as indicated by the higher-layer parameter ite-CRS-ToMatchAround, ite-CRS-PatternList 1, ite-CRS-PatternList2, ite-CRSPatternList3, or lte-CRS-PatternList4, then \( \bar{l} \) shall be incremented by one in all slots.

The time-domain index \( l^{\prime} \) and the supported antenna ports \( p \) are given by Table 7.4.1.1.2-5 where
- single-symbol DM-RS is used if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in the DMRS-DownlinkConfig IE is not configured;
- single-symbol or double-symbol DM-RS is determined by the associated DCI if the higher-layer parameter maxLength in the DMRS-DownlinkConfig IE is equal to 'len2';
- basic or enhanced DM-RS multiplexing is controlled by the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeEnh.

In absence of CSI-RS configuration, and unless otherwise configured, the UE may assume PDSCH DM-RS and SS/PBCH block to be quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters. Unless specified otherwise, the UE may assume that the PDSCH DM-RS within the same CDM group are quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and spatial Rx (when applicable). The UE may assume that DMRS ports associated with a TCI state as described in clause 5.1.6.2 of [6, TS 38.214] of a PDSCH are QCL with QCL Type A, Type D (when applicable) and average gain.

The UE may assume that no DM-RS collides with the SS/PBCH block.
