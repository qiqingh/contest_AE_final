- \( \quad N_{\text {ID }} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 65535\} \) is given by the higher-layer parameter pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID if configured for a common search space in a common MBS frequency resource;
- \( \quad N_{\text {ID }}=N_{\text {ID }}^{\text {cell }} \) otherwise.
7.4.1.3.2 Mapping to physical resources

The UE shall assume the sequence \( r_{l}(m) \) is mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) according to
\[
\begin{array}{l}
a_{k, i}^{(p, \mu)}=\beta_{\mathrm{DMRS}}^{\mathrm{PDCCH}}+r_{j}\left(3 n+k^{\prime}\right) \\
k=n N_{\mathrm{sC}}^{\mathrm{RB}}+4 k^{\prime}+1 \\
k^{\prime}=0,1,2 \\
n=0,1, \ldots
\end{array}
\]
where the following conditions are fulfilled
- they are within the resource element groups constituting the PDCCH the UE attempts to decode if the higherlayer parameter precoderGranularity equals sameAsREG-bundle,
- all resource-element groups within the set of contiguous resource blocks in the CORESET where the UE attempts to decode the PDCCH if the higher-layer parameter precoderGranularity equals allContiguousRBs.

The reference point for \( k \) is
- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in the CORESET if the CORESET is configured by the PBCH or by the controlResourceSetZero field in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon IE,
- subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 otherwise

The quantity \( l \) is the OFDM symbol number within the slot.
The antenna port \( p=2000 \).
A UE not attempting to detect a PDCCH in a CORESET shall not make any assumptions on the presence or absence of DM-RS in the CORESET.

In absence of CSI-RS configuration, and unless otherwise configured, the UE may assume PDCCH DM-RS and SS/PBCH block to be quasi co-located with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread, and, when applicable, spatial Rx parameters.
7.4.1.4 Demodulation reference signals for PBCH
7.4.1.4.1 Sequence generation

The UE shall assume the reference-signal sequence \( r(m) \) for an SS/PBCH block is defined by
\[
r(m)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 \cdot c(2 m))+j \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 \cdot c(2 m+1))
\]
where \( c(n) \) is given by clause 5.2 . The scrambling sequence generator shall be initialized at the start of each SS/PBCH block occasion with
\[
c_{\text {init }}=2^{11}\left(\bar{i}_{\mathrm{SSE}}+1\right)\left(\left\lfloor N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cell }} / 4\right\rfloor+1\right)+2^{6}\left(\bar{i}_{\mathrm{SSE}}+1\right)+\left(N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cell }} \bmod 4\right)
\]
where
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=4, \bar{i}_{\mathrm{SSB}}=i_{\mathrm{SSB}}+4 n_{\mathrm{hf}} \) where \( n_{\mathrm{hf}} \) is the number of the half-frame in which the PBCH is transmitted in a frame with \( n_{\mathrm{hf}}=0 \) for the first half-frame in the frame and \( n_{\mathrm{hf}}=1 \) for the second half-frame in the frame, and \( i_{\text {SSB }} \) is the two least significant bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index as defined in [5, TS 38.213]
