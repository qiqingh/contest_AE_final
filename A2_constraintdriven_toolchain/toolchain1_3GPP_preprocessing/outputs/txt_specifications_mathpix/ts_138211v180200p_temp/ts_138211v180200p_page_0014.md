4.3.2 Slots

For subcarrier spacing configuration \( \mu \), slots are numbered \( n_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mu} \in\left\{0, \ldots, N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {subframe }, \mu}-1\right\} \) in increasing order within a subframe and \( n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu} \in\left\{0, \ldots, N_{\text {slot }}^{\text {frame }, \mu}-1\right\} \) in increasing order within a frame. There are \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) consecutive OFDM symbols in a slot where \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) depends on the cyclic prefix as given by Tables 4.3.2-1 and 4.3.2-2. The start of slot \( n_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mu} \) in a subframe is aligned in time with the start of OFDM symbol \( n_{s}^{\mu} N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {slot }} \) in the same subframe.

OFDM symbols in a slot in a downlink or uplink frame can be classified as 'downlink', 'flexible', or 'uplink'. Signaling of slot formats is described in clause 11.1 of [5, TS 38.213].

In a slot in a downlink frame, the UE shall assume that downlink transmissions only occur in 'downlink' or 'flexible' symbols.

In a slot in an uplink frame, the UE shall only transmit in 'uplink' or 'flexible' symbols.
A UE not capable of full-duplex communication and not supporting simultaneous transmission and reception as defined by parameter simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC, simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA or simultaneousRxTxSUL [10, TS 38.306] among all cells within a group of cells is not expected to transmit in the uplink in one cell within the group of cells earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last received downlink symbol in the same or different cell within the group of cells where \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

A UE not capable of full-duplex communication and not supporting simultaneous transmission and reception as defined by parameter simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC, simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA or simultaneousRxTxSUL [10, TS 38.306] among all cells within a group of cells is not expected to receive in the downlink in one cell within the group of cells earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last transmitted uplink symbol in the same or different cell within the group of cells where \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

For DAPS handover operation, a UE not capable of full-duplex communication is not expected to transmit in the uplink to a cell earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last received downlink symbol in the different cell where \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

For DAPS handover operation, a UE not capable of full-duplex communication is not expected to receive in the downlink from a cell earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last transmitted uplink symbol in the different cell where \( N_{\mathrm{T} \text { - } \mathrm{Rx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

A UE not capable of full-duplex communication is not expected to transmit in the uplink earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last received downlink symbol in the same cell where \( N_{\mathrm{Rx}-\mathrm{Tx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.

A UE not capable of full-duplex communication is not expected to receive in the downlink earlier than \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \) after the end of the last transmitted uplink symbol in the same cell where \( N_{\mathrm{Tx}-\mathrm{Rx}} \) is given by Table 4.3.2-3.
