ETSI TS 138211 V18.2.0 (2024-05)
- \( \quad N_{\text {RB }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) and \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) are defined by Table 13-0 in clause 13 of [5, TS 38.213];
- If \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {CORESET }}=12 \) on a carrier with a channel bandwidth of 3 MHz , the CORESET is obtained by applying the description above assuming interleaved mapping with \( R=2 \);
- if \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {CORESET }}=24 \) on a carrier with a channel bandwidth of 3 MHz , the CORESET is obtained by applying the description above assuming interleaved mapping with \( R=2 \) or non-interleaved mapping as defined by clause 13 of [5, TS 38.213], followed by puncturing the 9 highest-numbered resource blocks to obtain the 15 resource blocks forming CORESET 0;
- if \( N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {CORESET }}=24 \) on a carrier with a channel bandwidth of 5 MHz , the CORESET is obtained by applying the description above assuming interleaved mapping with \( R=2 \), followed by puncturing the 4 highest-numbered resource blocks to obtain the 20 resource blocks forming CORESET 0;
- \( L=6 \);
- \( n_{\text {shift }}=N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cll }} \);
- the UE may assume normal cyclic prefix when CORESET 0 is configured by MIB or SIB1;
- the UE may assume the same precoding being used within a REG bundle.
7.3.2.3 Scrambling

The UE shall assume the block of bits \( b(0), \ldots, b\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\text {bit }} \) is the number of bits transmitted on the physical channel, is scrambled prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) according to
\[
\tilde{b}(i)=(b(i)+c(i)) \bmod 2
\]
where the scrambling sequence \( c(i) \) is given by clause 5.2.1. The scrambling sequence generator shall be initialized with
\[
c_{\text {init }}=\left(n_{\text {RNTI }} \cdot 2^{16}+n_{\text {ID }}\right) \bmod 2^{3 l}
\]
where
- for a UE-specific search space as defined in clause 10 of \( \left[5\right. \), TS 38.213], \( n_{\mathrm{ID}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 65535\} \) equals the higherlayer parameter pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID if configured;
- for a PDCCH with the CRC scrambled by G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI, or multicast-MCCH-RNTI in a common search space as defined in clause 10 of [5, TS 38.213], \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 65535\} \) equals the higher-layer parameter pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID if configured in a common MBS frequency resource;
- \( n_{1 \mathrm{D}}=N_{1 \mathrm{D}}^{\text {cell }} \) otherwise
and where
- \( n_{\text {RNTI }} \) is given by the C-RNTI for a PDCCH in a UE-specific search space if the higher-layer parameter pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID is configured, and
- \( n_{\text {RNTI }}=0 \) otherwise.
7.3.2.4 PDCCH modulation

The UE shall assume the block of bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) to be QPSK modulated as described in clause 5.1.3, resulting in a block of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d(0), \ldots, d\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \).
