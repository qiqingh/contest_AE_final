8.3.2.2 Modulation

The block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) shall be modulated as described in clause 5.1 using QPSK, resulting in a block of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d(0), \ldots, d\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) where \( M_{\text {symb }}=M_{\text {bit }} / 2 \).
8.3.2.3 Mapping to physical resources

The set of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d(0), \ldots, d\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) shall be multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {DMRS }}^{\text {PSCCH }} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( d(0) \) to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) assigned for transmission according to clause 16.4 of \( [5, \mathrm{TS} 38.213] \), and not used for the demodulation reference signals associated with PSCCH , in increasing order of first the index \( k \) over the assigned physical resources, and then the index \( l \) on antenna port \( p=2000 \).

The resource elements used for the PSCCH in the first OFDM symbol in the mapping operation above, including any DM-RS, PT-RS, or CSI-RS occurring in the first OFDM symbol, shall be duplicated in the immediately preceding OFDM symbol.
8.3.3 Physical sidelink broadcast channel
8.3.3.1 Scrambling

The block of bits \( b(0), \ldots, b\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\text {bit }} \) is the number of bits transmitted on the physical sidelink broadcast channel, shall be scrambled prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) according to
\[
\tilde{b}(i)=(b(i)+c(i)) \bmod 2
\]
where the scrambling sequence \( c(i) \) is given by clause 5.2.1. The scrambling sequence generator shall be initialized with \( c_{\text {init }}=N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\mathrm{SL}} \) at the start of each S-SS/PSBCH block.
8.3.3.2 Modulation

The block of bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) shall be QPSK modulated as described in clause 5.1 .3, resulting in a block of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d_{\text {PSBCH }}(0), \ldots, d_{\text {PSBCH }}\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) where \( M_{\text {symb }}=M_{\text {bit }} / 2 \).
8.3.3.3 Mapping to physical resources

Mapping to physical resources is described in clause 8.4.3.
8.3.4 Physical sidelink feedback channel
8.3.4.1 General
8.3.4.2 PSFCH format 0
8.3.4.2.1 Sequence generation

The sequence \( x(n) \) shall be generated according to
\[
\begin{array}{c}
x(n)=r_{u, v}^{\alpha, \delta}(n) \\
n=0,1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{sc}}^{\mathrm{RB}}-1
\end{array}
\]
where \( r_{u, v}^{(\alpha, \delta)}(n) \) is given by clause 6.3.2.2 with the following exceptions:
