7.3.2.5 Mapping to physical resources

The UE shall assume the block of complex-valued symbols \( d(0), \ldots, d\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) to be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\mathrm{PDCCH}} \) and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) used for the monitored PDCCH and not used for the associated PDCCH DMRS in increasing order of first \( k \), then \( l \). The antenna port \( p=2000 \).
7.3.3 Physical broadcast channel
7.3.3.1 Scrambling

The UE shall assume the block of bits \( b(0), \ldots, b\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \), where \( M_{\text {bit }} \) is the number of bits transmitted on the physical broadcast channel, are scrambled prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-\right. \) 1) according to
\[
\tilde{b}(i)=\left(b(i)+c\left(i+v M_{\mathrm{bit}}\right)\right) \bmod 2
\]
where the scrambling sequence \( c(i) \) is given by clause 5.2 . The scrambling sequence shall be initialized with \( c_{\text {init }}= N_{\text {ID }}^{\text {cell }} \) at the start of each SS/PBCH block where
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}=4, v \) is the two least significant bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index
- for \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }}>4, v \) is the three least significant bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index
with \( \bar{L}_{\text {max }} \) being the maximum number of candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame, as described in [5, TS 38.213].
7.3.3.2 Modulation

The UE shall assume the block of bits \( \tilde{b}(0), \ldots, \tilde{b}\left(M_{\text {bit }}-1\right) \) are QPSK modulated as described in clause 5.1 .3 , resulting in a block of complex-valued modulation symbols \( d_{\mathrm{PBCH}}(0), \ldots, d_{\mathrm{PBCH}}\left(M_{\mathrm{symb}}-1\right) \).
7.3.3.3 Mapping to physical resources

Mapping to physical resources is described in clause 7.4.3.
7.4 Physical signals
7.4.1 Reference signals
7.4.1.1 Demodulation reference signals for PDSCH
7.4.1.1.1 Sequence generation

The UE shall assume the sequence \( r(n) \) is defined by
\[
r(n)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 \cdot c(2 n))+j \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1-2 \cdot c(2 n+1))
\]
where the pseudo-random sequence \( c(i) \) is defined in clause 5.2.1. The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be initialized with
\[
c_{\mathrm{in} \text { it }}=\left(2^{17}\left(N_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\mathrm{slot}} n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu}+l+1\right)\left(2 N_{\mathrm{JD}}^{n_{\mathrm{SCID}}^{\bar{\lambda}}}+1\right)+2^{17}\left[\frac{\bar{\lambda}}{2}\right]+2 N_{\mathrm{JD}}^{n_{\mathrm{SCID}}^{\bar{\lambda}}}+\bar{n}_{\mathrm{SCJD}}^{\bar{\lambda}}\right) \bmod 2^{31}
\]
where \( l \) is the OFDM symbol number within the slot, \( n_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{f}}^{\mu} \) is the slot number within a frame, and
