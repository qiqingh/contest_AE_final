cyclic prefix and \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {S-SSB }}=11 \) for extended cyclic prefix. The first OFDM symbol in an S-SS/PSBCH block is the first OFDM symbol in the slot.

In the frequency domain, an S-SS/PSBCH block consists of 132 contiguous subcarriers with the subcarriers numbered in increasing order from 0 to 131 within the sidelink S-SS/PSBCH block. The quantities \( k \) and \( l \) represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one sidelink S-SS/PSBCH block.

For an S-SS/PSBCH block, the UE shall use
- antenna port 4000 for transmission of S-PSS, S-SSS, PSBCH and DM-RS for PSBCH;
- the same cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing for the S-PSS, S-SSS, PSBCH and DM-RS for PSBCH,

8.4.3.1.1 Mapping of S-PSS within an S-SS/PSBCH block

The sequence of symbols \( d_{\text {S-PSS }}(0), \ldots, d_{\text {S-PSS }}(126) \) constituting the sidelink primary synchronization signal in one OFDM symbol shall be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{S-P S S} \) to conform to the S-PSS power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of \( k \) in each of the symbols \( l \), where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 8.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one S-SS/PSBCH block.
8.4.3.1.2 Mapping of S-SSS within an S-SS/PSBCH block

The sequence of symbols \( d_{\text {S-SSS }}(0), \ldots, d_{\text {S-SSS }}(126) \) constituting the sidelink secondary synchronization signal in one OFDM symbol shall be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{S-S S S} \) to conform to the S-SSS power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped to resource elements ( \( k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of \( k \) in each of the symbols \( l \), where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 8.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one S-SS/PSBCH block.
8.4.3.1.3 Mapping of PSBCH and DM-RS within an S-SS/PSBCH block

The sequence of complex-valued symbols \( d_{\text {PSBCH }}(0), \ldots, d_{\text {PSBCH }}\left(M_{\text {symb }}-1\right) \) constituting the physical sidelink broadcast channel shall be scaled by a factor \( \beta_{\text {DMRS }}^{\text {PSBCH }} \) to conform to the PSBCH power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( d_{\text {PSBCH }}(0) \) to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) which meet all the following criteria:
- they are not used for PSBCH demodulation reference signals

The mapping to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) not reserved for PSBCH DM-RS shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k \) and then the index \( l \), where \( k \) and \( l \) represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one \( S \) SS/PSBCH block and are given by Table 8.4.3.1-1.

The sequence of complex-valued symbols \( r(0), \ldots, r\left(33\left(N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {S-SSB }}-4\right)-1\right) \) constituting the demodulation reference signals for the S-SS/PSBCH block shall be scaled by a factor of \( \beta_{\text {DMRS }}^{\text {PSBCH }} \) to conform to the PSBCH power allocation specified in [5, TS 38.213] and mapped to resource elements \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) in increasing order of first \( k \) and then \( l \) where \( k \) and \( l \) are given by Table 8.4.3.1-1 and represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one S-SS/PSBCH block.
