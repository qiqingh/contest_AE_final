- the resource element \( (k, l)_{p, \mu} \) is within the resource blocks occupied by the CSI-RS resource for which the UE is configured

The reference point for \( k=0 \) is subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0 .
The value of \( \rho \) is given by the higher-layer parameter density in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E or the CSI-RSCellMobility I \( E \) and the number of ports \( X \) is given by the higher-layer parameter nrofPorts. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRS-ResourceSet [E, the density \( \rho=3 \) and number of ports \( X=1 \).

The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and DM-RS on the same resource elements.
The UE shall assume \( \beta_{\text {CSIRS }}>0 \) for a non-zero-power CSI-RS where \( \beta_{\text {CSIRS }} \) is selected such that the power offset specified by the higher-layer parameter powerControlOffsetSS in the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource [E or in the TRSResourceSet [E, if provided, is fulfilled.

The quantities \( k^{\prime}, l^{\prime}, w_{\mathrm{f}}\left(k^{\prime}\right) \), and \( w_{\mathrm{t}}\left(l^{\prime}\right) \) are given by Tables 7.4.1.5.3-1 to 7.4.1.5.3-5 where each \( (\bar{k}, \bar{l}) \) in a given row of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to a CDM group of size 1 (no CDM) or size 2,4 , or 8. The CDM type is provided by the higher layer parameter cdm-Type in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping IE. For NZP CSI-RS configured by the TRSResourceSet [E, the CDM type is 'noCDM'. The indices \( k^{\prime} \) and \( l^{\prime} \) index resource elements within a CDM group.

The time-domain locations \( l_{0} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 13\} \) and \( l_{1} \in\{2,3, \ldots, 12\} \) are provided by the higher-layer parameters firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain and firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain2, respectively, in the CSI-RSResourceMapping IE or the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility IE and defined relative to the start of a slot. For NZP CSIRS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the time-domain location \( l_{0} \in\{0,1, \ldots, 13\} \) is provided by the higher-layer parameter firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain or firstOFDMSymbollnTimeDomain+4.

The frequency-domain location is given by a bitmap provided by the higher-layer parameter frequencyDomainAllocation in the CSI-RS-ResourceMapping [E, the CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility [E, or the TRSResourceSet [E, with the bitmap and value of \( k_{i} \) in Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 given by
- \( \left[b_{3} \cdots b_{0}\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) \) for row 1 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1
- \( \left[b_{1}, \cdots b_{0}\right], k_{i-1}=f(i) \) for row 2 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1
- \( \left[b_{2} \cdots b_{0}\right], k_{i-1}=4 f(i) \) for row 4 of Table 7.4.1.5.3-1
- \( \left[b_{5} \cdots b_{0}\right], k_{i-1}=2 f(i) \) for all other cases
where \( f(i) \) is the bit number of the \( i^{\text {th }} \) bit in the bitmap set to one, repeated across every \( [1 / \rho] \) of the resource blocks configured for CSI-RS reception by the UE. The starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the UE shall assume that CSI-RS is transmitted are given by the higher-layer parameters freqBand and density in the CSI-RSResourceMapping [E for the bandwidth part given by the higher-layer parameter BWP-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig IE or given by the higher-layer parameters nrofPRBs in the CSI-RS-CellMobility [E where the the startPRB given by csi\( r s \)-Measurement \( B W \) is relative to common resource block 0 . For NZP CSI-RS configured by TRS-ResourceSet [E, the starting position and number of the resource blocks in which the CSI-RS can be transmitted are given by the higherlayer parameters nrofRBs, and startingRB in the TRS-ResourceSet [E, where startingRB is relative to common resource block 0 and the density \( \rho=3 \).

The UE shall assume that a CSI-RS is transmitted using antenna ports \( p \) numbered according to
\[
\begin{array}{l}
p=3000+s+j L \\
j=0,1, \ldots, N / L-1 \\
s=0,1, \ldots, L-1
\end{array}
\]
where \( s \) is the sequence index provided by Tables 7.4.1.5.3-2 to 7.4.1.5.3-5, \( L \in\{1,2,4,8\} \) is the CDM group size, and \( N \) is the number of CSI-RS ports. The CDM group index \( j \) given in Table 7.4.1.5.3-1 corresponds to the time/frequency locations \( (\bar{k}, \bar{l}) \) for a given row of the table. The CDM groups are numbered in order of increasing frequency domain allocation first and then increasing time domain allocation.
