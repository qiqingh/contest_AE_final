7.4.2.3.2 Mapping to physical resources

Mapping to physical resources is described in clause 7.4.3.
7.4.3 SS/PBCH block
7.4.3.1 Time-frequency structure of an SS/PBCH block

In the time domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 4 OFDM symbols, numbered in increasing order from 0 to 3 within the SS/PBCH block, where PSS, SSS, and PBCH with associated DM-RS are mapped to symbols as given by Table 7.4.3.1-1.

In the frequency domain, an SS/PBCH block consists of 240 contiguous subcarriers with the subcarriers numbered in increasing order from 0 to 239 within the SS/PBCH block. The quantities \( k \) and \( l \) represent the frequency and time indices, respectively, within one SS/PBCH block. The UE may assume that the complex-valued symbols corresponding to resource elements denoted as 'Set to 0 ' in Table 7.4.3.1-1 are set to zero. The quantity \( v \) in Table 7.4.3.1-1 is given by \( v=N_{\mathrm{ID}}^{\text {cell }} \bmod 4 \). The quantity \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is the subcarrier offset from subcarrier 0 in common resource block \( N_{\mathrm{CRB}}^{\text {SSB }} \) to the lowest-numbered subcarrier of the SS/PBCH block, or the SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, where \( N_{\text {CRB }}^{\text {SSB }} \) is obtained from the higher-layer parameter offsetToPointA.
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and for operation without shared spectrum channel access, the 4 least significant bits of \( k_{\text {SSB }} \) are given by the higher-layer parameter ssb-SubcarrierOffset and for FR1 the most significant bit of \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is given by \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+5} \) in the PBCH payload as defined in clause 7.1 -1 of \( [4, \mathrm{TS} \) 38.212].
- For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, the 4 least significant bits of \( \bar{k}_{\text {SSB }} \) are given by the higher-layer parameter ssb-SubcarrierOffset and the most significant bit of \( \bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is given by \( \bar{a}_{\bar{A}+5} \) in the PBCH payload as defined in clause 7.1 . 1 of [ \( 4, \mathrm{TS} 38.212 \) ]. If \( \bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \geq 24, k_{\mathrm{SSB}}=\bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} \); otherwise, \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}}=2\left\lfloor\bar{k}_{\mathrm{SSB}} / 2\right\rfloor \).

If ssb-SubcarrierOffset is not provided, \( k_{\mathrm{SSB}} \) is derived from the frequency difference between the SS/PBCH block and Point A.

The UE may assume that the complex-valued symbols corresponding to resource elements that are part of a common resource block partially or fully overlapping with an SS/PBCH block, or an SS/PBCH block after puncturing if applicable, and not used for SS/PBCH transmission are set to zero in the OFDM symbols partially or fully overlapping with OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH is transmitted.

For an SS/PBCH block, the UE shall assume
- antenna port \( p=4000 \) is used for transmission of PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH,
- the same cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing for the PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH,
