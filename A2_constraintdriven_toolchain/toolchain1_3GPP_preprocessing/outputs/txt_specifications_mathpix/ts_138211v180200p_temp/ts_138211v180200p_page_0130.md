k & =\left\{\begin{array}{ll}

where \( w_{\mathrm{f}}\left(k^{\prime}\right), w_{\mathrm{t}}\left(l^{\prime}\right) \), and \( \Delta \) are given by Tables 7.4.1.1.2-1 and 7.4.1.1.2-2 and the following conditions are fulfilled:
- the resource elements are within the common resource blocks allocated for PDSCH transmission

The reference point for \( k \) is
- subcarrier 0 of the lowest-numbered resource block in CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI;
- otherwise, subcarrier 0 in common resource block 0

The reference point for \( l \) and the position \( l_{0} \) of the first DM-RS symbol depends on the mapping type:
- for PDSCH mapping type A:
- \( l \) is defined relative to the start of the slot
- \( l_{0}=3 \) if the higher-layer parameter dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos3' and \( l_{0}=2 \) otherwise
- for PDSCH mapping type B:
- \( l \) is defined relative to the start of the scheduled PDSCH resources
\( -l_{0}=0 \)
The position(s) of the DM-RS symbols is given by \( \bar{l} \) and duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \) where
- for PDSCH mapping type \( \mathrm{A}, l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration between the first OFDM symbol of the slot and the last OFDM symbol of the scheduled PDSCH resources in the slot
- for PDSCH mapping type \( \mathrm{B}, l_{\mathrm{d}} \) is the duration of the scheduled PDSCH resources
and according to Tables 7.4.1.1.2-3 and 7.4.1.1.2-4.
For PDSCH mapping type A
- the case dmrs-AdditionalPosition equals to 'pos3' is only supported when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=3 \) and \( l_{\mathrm{d}}=4 \) symbols in Tables 7.4.1.1.2-3 and 7.4.1.1.2-4 respectively is only applicable when dmrs-TypeA-Position is equal to 'pos2';
- single-symbol DM-RS, \( l_{1}=11 \) except if all of the following conditions are fulfilled in which case \( l_{1}=12 \) :
- the higher-layer parameter lte-CRS-ToMatchAround, lte-CRS-PatternList 1, lte-CRS-PatternList2, lte-CRSPatternList3, or Ite-CRS-PatternList4 is configured; and
- the higher-layer parameter dmrs-AdditionalPosition is equal to 'pos1' and \( l_{0}=3 \); and
- the UE has indicated it is capable of additionalDMRS-DL-Alt

For PDSCH mapping type B
- if the PDSCH duration \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\} \) OFDM symbols for normal cyclic prefix or \( l_{\mathrm{d}} \in \{2,4,6\} \) OFDM symbols for extended cyclic prefix, and the front-loaded DM-RS of the PDSCH allocation collides with resources reserved for a search space set associated with a CORESET, \( \bar{l} \) shall be incremented such that the first DM-RS symbol occurs immediately after the CORESET and until no collision with any CORESET occurs, and
