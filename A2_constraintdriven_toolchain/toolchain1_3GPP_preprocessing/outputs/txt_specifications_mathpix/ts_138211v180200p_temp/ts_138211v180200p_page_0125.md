- The UE is not expected to be configured with \( L_{i}=2 \) simultaneously with a PRG size of 4 as defined in [6, TS 38.214]

The UE may assume that the same precoding in the frequency domain is used within a PRB bundle and the bundle size is determined by clause 5.1.2.3 in [6, TS 38.214]. The UE shall not make any assumption that the same precoding is used for different bundles of common resource blocks.

For PDSCH transmissions scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_1 \) or \( 4 \_2 \), and using G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the quantities \( N_{\text {BWP }, i}^{\text {start }} \) and \( N_{\text {BWP }, i}^{\text {size }} \) in this clause are replaced by \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {start }} \) and \( N_{\text {MBS }, i}^{\text {size }} \), respectively, and \( L_{i} \) is the bundle size for the common MBS frequency resource provided by the higher-layer parameter vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver in pdschConfigMulticast.

For PDSCH transmissions scheduled by DCI format \( 4 \_0 \), and using G-RNTI for broadcast, MCCH-RNTI, or multicast-MCCH-RNTI, the quantities \( N_{\text {BWP, } i}^{\text {start }} \) and \( N_{\text {BWP, } i}^{\text {size }} \) in this clause are replaced by \( N_{\text {MBS, } i}^{\text {start }} \) and \( N_{\text {MBS, } i}^{\text {size }} \), respectively, and \( L_{i}= \) 2.
7.3.2 Physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)
7.3.2.1 Control-channel element (CCE)

A physical downlink control channel consists of one or more control-channel elements (CCEs) as indicated in Table 7.3.2.1-1.

\hline Aggregation level & Number of CCEs \\
\hline 1 & 1 \\
\hline 2 & 2 \\
\hline 4 & 4 \\
\hline 8 & 8 \\
\hline 16 & 16 \\

7.3.2.2 Control-resource set (CORESET)

A control-resource set consists of \( N_{\text {RB }}^{\text {CORESET }} \) resource blocks in the frequency domain and \( N_{\text {symb }}^{\text {CORESET }} \in\{1,2,3\} \) symbols in the time domain.

A control-channel element consists of 6 resource-element groups (REGs) where a resource-element group equals one resource block during one OFDM symbol. Resource-element groups within a control-resource set are numbered in increasing order in a time-first manner, starting with 0 for the first OFDM symbol and the lowest-numbered resource block in the control resource set.

A UE can be configured with multiple control-resource sets. Each control-resource set is associated with one CCE-toREG mapping only.

The CCE-to-REG mapping for a control-resource set can be interleaved or non-interleaved and is described by REG bundles:
- REG bundle \( i \) is defined as REGs \( \{i L, i L+1, \ldots, i L+L-1\} \) where \( L \) is the REG bundle size, \( i= 0,1, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{REG}}^{\text {CORESET }} / L-1 \), and \( N_{\mathrm{REG}}^{\text {CORESET }}=N_{\mathrm{RB}}^{\text {CORESET }} N_{\mathrm{symb}}^{\text {CORESET }} \) is the number of REGs in the CORESET
- CCE \( j \) consists of REG bundles \( \{f(6 j / L), f(6 j / L+1), \ldots, f(6 j / L+6 / L-1)\} \) where \( f(\cdot) \) is an interleaver
