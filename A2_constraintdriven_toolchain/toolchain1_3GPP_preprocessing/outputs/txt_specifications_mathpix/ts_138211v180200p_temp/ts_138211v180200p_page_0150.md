8.2 Physical resources
8.2.1 General

In a shared SL PRS resource pool, the OFDM symbol immediately preceding the symbols which are configured for use by PSFCH if PSFCH is configured in this slot, and the last symbol configured for sidelink in a slot, serve as guard symbol(s). In a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, the last symbol configured for sidelink in a slot serves as a guard symbol. Otherwise, the OFDM symbol immediately following the last symbol used for PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SSB serves as a guard symbol.

The first OFDM symbol of a PSSCH and its associated PSCCH is duplicated as described in clauses 8.3.1.5 and 8.3.2.3. The first OFDM symbol of a PSFCH is duplicated as described in clause 8.3.4.2.2.

The OFDM symbol immediately preceding an SL PRS transmission in a dedicated SL PRS resource pool is generated as described in clause 8.4.1.6.3.
8.2.2 Numerologies

Multiple OFDM numerologies are supported as given by Table 8.2.2-1 where \( \mu \) and the cyclic prefix for a sidelink bandwidth part are obtained from the higher-layer parameter \( s l-B W P \).

8.2.3 Frame structure
8.2.3.1 Frames and subframes

The frame and subframe structure for sidelink transmission is defined in clause 4.3.1.
8.2.3.2 Slots

The slot structure for sidelink transmission is defined in clause 4.3.2.
8.2.4 Antenna ports

An antenna port is defined in clause 4.4.1.
The following antenna ports are defined for the sidelink:
- Antenna ports starting with 1000 for PSSCH
- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PSCCH
- Antenna ports starting with 3000 for CSI-RS
- Antenna ports starting with 4000 for S-SS/PSBCH block
- Antenna ports starting with 5000 for PSFCH
- Antenna ports starting with 6000 for SL PRS

For DM-RS associated with a PSBCH, the channel over which a PSBCH symbol on one antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a DM-RS symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed only if the two
