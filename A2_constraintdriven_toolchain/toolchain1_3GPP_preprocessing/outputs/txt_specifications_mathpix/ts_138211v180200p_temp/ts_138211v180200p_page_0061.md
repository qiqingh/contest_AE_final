6.3.1.6 Mapping to virtual resource blocks

For each of the antenna ports used for transmission of the PUSCH, the block of complex-valued symbols \( z^{(p)}(0), \ldots, z^{(p)}\left(M_{\text {symb }}^{\text {ap }}-1\right) \) shall be multiplied with the amplitude scaling factor \( \beta_{\text {PUSCH }} \) in order to conform to the transmit power specified in [5, TS 38-213] and mapped in sequence starting with \( z^{(p)}(0) \) to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission which meet all of the following criteria:
- they are in the virtual resource blocks assigned for transmission, and
- the corresponding resource elements in the corresponding physical resource blocks are not used for transmission of the associated DM-RS, PT-RS, or DM-RS intended for other co-scheduled UEs as described in clause 6.4.1.1.3

The mapping to resource elements \( \left(k^{\prime}, l\right)_{p, \mu} \) allocated for PUSCH according to [ 6, TS 38.214] shall be in increasing order of first the index \( k^{\prime} \) over the assigned virtual resource blocks, where \( k^{\prime}=0 \) is the first subcarrier in the lowest-
